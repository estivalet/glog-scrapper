{"altername_name": ["Game & Watch: Chef"], "name": "Chef", "overview": "A chef paces back and forth in a kitchen, using his frying pan to keep pieces of food airborne. If a piece of food ends up on the floor, a mouse will grab it and the player will get penalized with a miss. The cat at the left-hand side of the screen will occasionally grab the leftmost piece of food with a fork, only to keep it from falling to the ground. It is also the origin of Mr. Game & Watch's standard B Button move in the Super Smash Bros. series. As the game progresses, the food will move faster. In Game A, the player must flip three pieces of food. In Game B, the player must flip four pieces of food. At 200 and 500 points, any misses the player has will be erased.", "platform": "Nintendo Game & Watch", "release_date": "September 8, 1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nintendo EAD", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Game_%26_Watch_games#Chef", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LR7HP6wV0I", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/112004-chef\n"}
