{"altername_name": ["Senso"], "name": "Simon", "overview": "Simon is an electronic game of memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison, working for toy design firm Marvin Glass and Associates, with software programming by Lenny Cope. The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails or the time limit runs out, the game is over. The original version was manufactured and distributed by Milton Bradley and later by Hasbro after it took over Milton Bradley. Simon was launched in 1978 at Studio 54 in New York City and was an immediate success, becoming a pop culture symbol of the 1970s and 1980s.", "platform": "Nintendo Game & Watch", "release_date": "1978", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Milton Bradley", "publishers": "Milton Bradley", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/140495-simon\n"}
