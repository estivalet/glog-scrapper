{"altername_name": ["Game & Watch: Parachute"], "name": "Parachute", "overview": "Parachute for the Game & Watch is game featuring skydivers parachuting over shark-infested waters. The player controls a lifeboat attempting to rescure the falling skydivers. The player must bove the lifeboat left and right to catch the skydivers. The player scores 1 point for every skydiver you successfully rescue. The number of skydivers increases (up to 10) as play progresses. When a skydiver falls into the water, he is attacked by sharks and you get a miss. If you get three misses then the game ends. There are two game modes. In Game A, the task is to catch the falling skydivers. In Game B, the skydivers on the right side of the screen will occasionally get caught on a tree and swing there for a while before you can rescue them.", "platform": "Nintendo Game & Watch", "release_date": "June 19, 1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nintendo", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.03", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Game_%26_Watch_games#Parachute", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPrDFHMfdS8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/82244-parachute\n"}
