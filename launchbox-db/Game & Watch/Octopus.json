{"altername_name": ["Mysteries of the Sea", "Mysteries of the Deep", "Game & Watch: Octopus"], "name": "Octopus", "overview": "Three scuba-divers head for a treasure under the sea, guarded by the Octopus. The divers must be patient, because the Octopus's arms are moving randomly. The player earns one point for every piece of treasure they grab and three points for returning the load to the boat. As the player progresses in the game, the Octopus's arms will move faster. Game B is faster and more difficult. All three lives are restored once the player hits 200 and 500 points.", "platform": "Nintendo Game & Watch", "release_date": "July 16, 1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nintendo", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.38", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Game_%26_Watch_games#Octopus", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/111933-octopus\n"}
