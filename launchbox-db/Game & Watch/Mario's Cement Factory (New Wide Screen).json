{"altername_name": ["Game & Watch: Mario's Cement Factory (New Wide Screen)"], "name": "Mario's Cement Factory (New Wide Screen)", "overview": "There are two drivers, each in a truck under a container. Mario earns a point each time he empties a load of cement from the upper hopper and two points each time he empties a load from the lower hopper. Each container can hold only three loads of cement. Allowing the containers to overflow causes cement to spill down onto the workers, hurting them and giving Mario one miss. Falling off an elevator platform also earns a miss, as well as touching the very top of the screen and getting crushed by an elevator platform, or touching the very bottom and getting shocked by the floor of the elevator. In all versions of the game, there is an area on the lowermost portion of the elevator that Mario can use to save himself from touching the very bottom and getting shocked. On the Table Top version, there is a similar area on the uppermost portion of the elevator. This does not appear on any other version of the game. If Mario gets 300 points without any misses, the points will be worth double until he does get a miss. If he has any misses at said score, all misses will be cleared instead. When he receives three misses, the game is over.", "platform": "Nintendo Game & Watch", "release_date": "June 16, 1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nintendo R&D1", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.07", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Game_%26_Watch_games#Mario's_Cement_Factory", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlJ4YKsyZ3g", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/114115-marios-cement-factory-new-wide-screen\n"}
