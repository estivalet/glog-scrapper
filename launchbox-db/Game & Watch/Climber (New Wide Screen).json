{"altername_name": ["Game & Watch: Climber (New Wide Screen)"], "name": "Climber (New Wide Screen)", "overview": "Climber is a Game & Watch game released as a part of the Crystal Screen series on July 4, 1986, and as a part of the New Wide Screen series on March 8, 1988. It is a single-screen single-player Game & Watch. It is similar to Ice Climber. A boy known as the Climber sets out for the Block Mountain where the Blockmen live to train as a warrior. Lord Meiji, who he meets on the way, grants him a pair of boots which enable him to jump very high, armor that can break ceilings, and a head band which will help him find a sword that can defeat Dragalo the Dragon. The climber pursues his quest with the assistance of the mysterious bird Hentori. The objective of the game is to control Climber by jumping through a tower of platforms and landing on them, and by avoiding monsters and blockmen. The goal is to either grab Hentori or slash Dragalo while achieving the highest score possible. Climber was recreated in Game & Watch Gallery 3 for Game Boy Color and Game & Watch Gallery 4 for Game Boy Advance.", "platform": "Nintendo Game & Watch", "release_date": "March 8, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nintendo EAD", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.39", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Game_%26_Watch_games#Climber", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYMP0oeramY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/112005-climber-new-wide-screen\n"}
