{"altername_name": ["touchme"], "name": "Touch Me", "overview": "Atari's first (and only released) handheld game. This is a handheld version of Atari's Touch Me arcade game (which was released in 1974), and it's the game that Milton Bradley got the idea for Simon from (it's the exact same game, just bigger). Touch Me is a one to four-player game where your memory and your concentration are the most important factors. There are three games, each one similar, yet slightly different. The object in all of the games generally speaking, is to follow the sequence of flashing lights or \"signals\" by pressing corresponding colored buttons. Each signal is accompanied by one of four different electronic tones.", "platform": "Nintendo Game & Watch", "release_date": "1978", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atari", "publishers": "Atari", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "1", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_Me_(arcade_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/140497-touch-me\n"}
