{"altername_name": ["Life Boat", "Game & Watch: Life Boat"], "name": "Lifeboat", "overview": "A fire breaks out on a luxury passenger liner, forcing the passengers to abandon ship. The player needs to place a lifeboat below them to rescue them. However, only four passengers can fit into the lifeboat, so rescuers must pull it towards the shore on either side to offload the passengers. The player receives a point for every passenger who enters the lifeboat and for every passenger delivered safely to shore. As time passes, the passengers will move faster. If a passenger misses the lifeboat or the player tries to catch one in a full lifeboat, the passenger will fall into the water and get eaten by a shark, and the player will receive a miss. If this happens at the same time a passenger is being unloaded to shore, the player will not receive any points. If the player reaches 300 points without any misses, the points will be worth double until the player does get a miss. If the player has any misses at said score, every miss will be cleared instead. When the player gets three misses, they receive a Game Over. Game A features two lifeboats (one on each side), while Game B features one (which can go to either side).", "platform": "Nintendo Game & Watch", "release_date": "October 25, 1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nintendo", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.27", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Game_%26_Watch_games#Lifeboat", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/84866-lifeboat\n"}
