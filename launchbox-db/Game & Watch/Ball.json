{"altername_name": ["Toss-Up", "Game & Watch: Ball"], "name": "Ball", "overview": "Ball (originally known as Toss-Up in North America) is a Game & Watch game released as a part of the Silver series on April 28, 1980. It was the first Game & Watch game. It is a single-screen single-player Game & Watch. In Game A, the player tosses two balls in the air. As the balls fall, the player must catch and toss them up again. One point is earned for each successful catch. A dropped ball will display a broken ball and end the game. The object is to continuously catch the balls that fall and throw them back up. In Game B, the player must juggle three balls, and each successful catch rewards ten points instead of one. The highest possible score a user can obtain is 9,999 for Game A and 9,990 for Game B, due to 9,999 not being a multiple of 10. Input: Left button (controls character's arms as well as the hours on the clock), right button (controls character's arm as well as the minutes on the clock), Game A button, Game B button, Time button (displays time), ACL (allows user to change the time displayed).", "platform": "Nintendo Game & Watch", "release_date": "April 28, 1980", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nintendo R&D1", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.69", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Game_%26_Watch_games#Ball", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQZtdXLWHk8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/79201-ball\n"}
