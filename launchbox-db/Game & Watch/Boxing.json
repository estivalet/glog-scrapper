The model number for the game was BX-301. Within the box of the game was the unit, LR44 batteries, and a caution leaflet. In the game you'll box another character. The game is seen from a 2D perspective, and your character is always on the right. The only difference between Boxing and Punch-Out!! were the names and the box.
