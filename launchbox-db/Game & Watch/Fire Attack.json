{"altername_name": ["Game & Watch: Fire Attack"], "name": "Fire Attack", "overview": "Fire Attack involves a cowboy who is using a hammer to try to stop attackers (represented as stereotypical Native Americans) from burning down his base. Every time the player hits a torch or an attacker, they receive two points. As the game progresses, the player will have to be a lot more cautious as more attackers appear. If an attacker manages to set the base on fire, the player will get a miss. If the player reaches 200 or 500 points without any misses, every torch or attacker the player hits will be worth five points for 30 to 50 seconds. If the player has any misses at either score, all misses will be removed instead. When the player gets three misses, they receive a Game Over. In Game A, attackers come from three directions, but they change positions and come from different directions after a miss is made. In Game B, attackers come from four directions, and the game gets faster sooner.", "platform": "Nintendo Game & Watch", "release_date": "March 26, 1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nintendo EAD", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.71", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Game_%26_Watch_games#Fire_Attack", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6jsCdHxUDA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/112006-fire-attack\n"}
