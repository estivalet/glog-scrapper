To reach and destroy your assigned target, you must maneuver through a field filled with enemy mines. Although these are hidden, the mine detection equipment in your tank warns you of their presence by producing a buzzing sound. This is your signal to change course on route to your target. If you should stumble into a mine, your tank will be \"destroyed\" and returned to its original starting position. If you get through the minefield and successfully engage the target, the built-in computer will automatically set up another challenge with a new starting position, target location, and minefield.", "platform": "Nintendo Game & Watch", "release_date": "1978", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Mattel Electronics", "publishers": "Mattel", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.69", "wikipedia": "https://www.handheldmuseum.com/Mattel/ArmorBattle.htm", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3894SYS2tM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/170176-armor-battle\n"}
