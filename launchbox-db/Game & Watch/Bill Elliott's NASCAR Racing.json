Well, we've given you the wheels, and now it's time to see if you've got what it takes to be crowned king of the road. Of course, before you burn rubber you should remember that at over 200 mph, you're either good, or you're the pits. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, START YOUR ENGINES. To get rolling, remove the plastic cover on the game screen, buckle your seatbelts and press the ON/START Switch. This will display the highest ranking finish from the last completed circuit. Then, check your supply of nerves, count down from 3 and press accelerate!", "platform": "Nintendo Game & Watch", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/168307-bill-elliotts-nascar-racing\n"}
