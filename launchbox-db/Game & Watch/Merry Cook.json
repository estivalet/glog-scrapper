The player controls a chef juggling around the food so that nothing touches the floor. If something does touches the floor, a mouse will pick it up and counts as a miss. Three misses will count as a game over. At irregular intervals a cat in the upper left corner will suspend a certain food item, making it harder for the player to guess which piece is flippable. Game B will have the player juggle four items, instead of the three in Game A.", "platform": "Nintendo Game & Watch", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Elektronika", "publishers": "Elektronika", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronika", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqDlq7g2YQU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/119660-merry-cook\n"}
