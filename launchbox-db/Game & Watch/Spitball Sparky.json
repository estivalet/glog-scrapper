{"altername_name": ["Game & Watch: Spitball Sparky"], "name": "Spitball Sparky", "overview": "As Sparky, players have to shoot blocks by keeping a ball afloat with puffs of air, creating a game similar to Breakout or Arkanoid. The player earns a point for erasing a green block, two points for a blue block, and three points for a red block. When the player clears a display, they will earn five points for every unit remaining on the bonus meter. The next display will contain more blocks, with the maximum being 18. If the player erases all but the red blocks and then hits all the red blocks once to make them flash, the player will be awarded 30 points. Eventually, blocks that require two hits to break will appear, as well as unbreakable barriers that get in the player's way. If a ball falls to the bottom, the player receives a miss. At 300 points, any misses the player has will be removed. The player receives a Game Over when they have three misses.", "platform": "Nintendo Game & Watch", "release_date": "February 7, 1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Nintendo EAD", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.22", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Game_%26_Watch_games#Spitball_Sparky", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/112014-spitball-sparky\n"}
