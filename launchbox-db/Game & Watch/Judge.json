{"altername_name": ["Game & Watch: Judge (green version)"], "name": "Judge", "overview": "After four counting sounds and three time signal sounds, the characters each hold up a placard with a number. If the player's number is larger, they must hit the opposing player with the hammer; if the player's number is smaller, they must run away. Each character earns three points for hitting the opponent and two points for dodging the opponent's attack. If both characters have the same number on their placards, the character who attacks first gets three points, while the one who dodges first gives the opponent two points. If the player dodges by mistake, the opponent will receive two points. If the player hits the opponent by mistake, the opponent will hit the player back and receive five points. The winner is the first one to get 99 points. Game B features a two-player mode.", "platform": "Nintendo Game & Watch", "release_date": "October 4, 1980", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nintendo EAD", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Game_%26_Watch_games#Judge", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/84977-judge\n"}
