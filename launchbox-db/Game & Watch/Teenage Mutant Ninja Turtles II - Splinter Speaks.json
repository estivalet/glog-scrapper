{"altername_name": [], "name": "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: Splinter Speaks", "overview": "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: Splinter Speaks is the second of Konami's TMNT LCD games. The device features almost the same controls as the first, with the two circular pads, but the right pad is now just a single button. In the game, the player takes control of the 4 titular turtles as they fight off the Foot Clan's minions on their way to face off against Shredder. The game is controlled by using the right button to attack and the d-pad to choose the direction to attack in and to jump up and down to avoid projectiles. If the turtle the player is controlling is hit, they are out of commission and the player is forced to switch to another. If all for are out then it's game over. The game consists of 5 stages. In the first two the player fights against hordes of the Foot Clan's minions, and in the final 3 stages they face off against Bebop, Rocksteady, and finally Shredder himself.", "platform": "Nintendo Game & Watch", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/372761-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-ii-splinter-speaks\n"}
