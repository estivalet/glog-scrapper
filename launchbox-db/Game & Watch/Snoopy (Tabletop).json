{"altername_name": ["SnoopyT"], "name": "Snoopy (Tabletop)", "overview": "The Table Top version of Snoopy has a bigger screen, enhanced color graphics and sound effects due to the color LCD (CLCD) model and larger housing. The player controls Snoopy, who has to prevent the musical notes from Schroeder's piano reaching the top level of the screen, where Woodstock is sleeping. The player controls Snoopy with his hammer, who has to jump from platform to platform to hit the floating music notes. In Game A one only has to deal with three music notes, whilst the pacing and the amount of music notes (four instead of three) to handle are increasing in Game B. After every 100 points Lucy, sleeping at the bottom will kick Schroeder's small piano.", "platform": "Nintendo Game & Watch", "release_date": "June 5, 1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nintendo", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.06", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/82347-snoopy-tabletop\n"}
