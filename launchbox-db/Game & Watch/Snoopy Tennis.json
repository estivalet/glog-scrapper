{"altername_name": ["SnoopyP", "SnoopyTn", "Game & Watch: Snoopy Tennis"], "name": "Snoopy Tennis", "overview": "Snoopy Tennis is a Game & Watch video game released in 1982 by Nintendo. The game was very successful, perhaps due to the Snoopy label, with Nintendo producing an estimated 1,200,000 worldwide. In the game, you control Snoopy, moving him up and down to make him hit the oncoming tennis balls with your racket. It was released on the Wide Screen format. A version of the game was released as a keychain title under the miniclassics label. The control button leaflet, which was only present in this game's box and Fire Attack's, showcases various characters from the Peanuts franchise. Unsurprisingly, due to licensing issues, the game was not released in any of the Game & Watch video games, though it was mentioned in Super Smash Bros. Brawl for the Wii.", "platform": "Nintendo Game & Watch", "release_date": "April 28, 1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nintendo R&D1", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.64", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Game_%26_Watch_games#Snoopy_Tennis", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78741-snoopy-tennis\n"}
