{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mattel Electronics: Auto Race", "overview": "Mattel Electronics: Auto Race is the first in the line of many Mattel Electronics games, and is credited with being the first handheld game that was entirely digital The player's car is represented by a bright blip (a vertical dash sign) on the bottom of the screen. The player must make it to the top of the screen 4 times (4 laps) to win, but, while making it towards the top, the player must swerve past other cars using the switch at the bottom of the system to toggle between three lanes. If hit by a car, the player's vehicle keeps moving back towards the bottom of the screen until it gets out of the other car's way. The goal is to beat the game before the 99 seconds (as high as the two-digit timer can show) given are up, and to get the shortest time possible. The player's car has four \"gears\" and the faster the gear, the faster the other cars come at it.", "platform": "Nintendo Game & Watch", "release_date": "1976", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mattel Electronics", "publishers": "Mattel Electronics", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.83", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mattel_Auto_Race", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/160825-mattel-electronics-auto-race\n"}
