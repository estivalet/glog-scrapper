{"altername_name": ["The Exterminator", "Game & Watch: Vermin"], "name": "Vermin", "overview": "Moles pop out of the ground, attempting to get into the player's garden. To keep them away, the player must move left and right and smack them with hammers. As the game progresses, the moles will move faster. If any moles are left untouched for a few seconds, the player gets penalized with a miss. The player receives a Game Over when they have three misses. Misses cannot be cleared at all in this Game & Watch title, which means the player needs to be very cautious.", "platform": "Nintendo Game & Watch", "release_date": "July 10, 1980", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nintendo", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.35", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Game_%26_Watch_games#Vermin", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/79202-vermin\n"}
