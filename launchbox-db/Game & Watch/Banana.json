{"altername_name": [], "name": "Banana", "overview": "Time & Fun Banana was an LCD handheld game released in 1981 as a part of the Time & Fun series of games. The gameplay is similar to Nintendo's Manhole Game & Watch where you have to keep pedestrians from slipping on the banana peel on the streets. With each miss an ambulance appears in the corner, and if you get five then the game is over. Game A is easier than Game B with the Time mode automatically switching on when left alone for 30 seconds.", "platform": "Nintendo Game & Watch", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "VTech", "publishers": "VTech", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR0O--DHZC0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/169960-banana\n"}
