{"altername_name": ["Game & Watch: Tropical Fish"], "name": "Tropical Fish", "overview": "The player controls a man who holds up a fishbowl to catch fish that jump from a fish tank. The player needs to keep catching the fish to transfer them to the other fish tank on the other side. Each time a fish lands in the fishbowl or the other fish tank, the player receives a point. As the player progresses in the game, more fish will appear, and they will eventually jump faster. If a fish lands on the floor, a cat will eat it and spit out the bones, and the player will get a miss. At 300 points, any misses the player has will be removed. The player receives a Game Over when they have three misses. In Game A, fish jump from the right fish tank to the left one. In Game B, fish might jump from either fish tank, and they also might jump either right or left after landing in the fishbowl.", "platform": "Nintendo Game & Watch", "release_date": "July 8, 1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nintendo EAD", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.86", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Game_%26_Watch_games#Tropical_Fish", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/112013-tropical-fish\n"}
