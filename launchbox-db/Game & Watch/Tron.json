{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tron", "overview": "TRON is a handheld game released by Tomy in 1982. It consists of three games that are based on action sequences from the movie TRON. In the first game, the player must move his light cycle around the Game Grid to cut off three Warrior Elite light cycles one at a time. In the second game, Tron and Sark throw discs at each other in the hope that either of them will miss catching it, causing that player to lose one of his four bars, the game being a combination of the jai-alai ring game from the movie and the arcade game Pong. In the third game, the player must throw his disc into the heart of the MCP to destroy it once and for all. Once all three games have been completed, the cycle starts anew with a faster and higher level of difficulty.", "platform": "Nintendo Game & Watch", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "TOMY", "publishers": "Tomy", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.06", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78571-tron\n"}
