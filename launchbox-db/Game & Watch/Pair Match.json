{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pair Match", "overview": "One or two player matching game (basically like Concentration). You select one square, and the game emits a certain sound, you then select a second square, if the sound that square makes matches the first one, you get those two squares lit up in your color, and you can play again. If they don't match, it's the second player's (or the computer's) turn. The person with the most lit squares at the end is the winner (there are 32 total squares or 16 different pairs that have to be matched.", "platform": "Nintendo Game & Watch", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Bandai", "publishers": "Bandai Electronics", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/140448-pair-match\n"}
