{"altername_name": ["Game & Watch: Lion"], "name": "Lion", "overview": "Here, lions are on the loose, forcing the lion tamers to use chairs to keep the lions in their cage. Each time the player keeps a lion in a cage, they earn two points. As the game progresses, the lions will move faster. If a lion escapes, the player gets a miss. At 200 and 500 points, any misses the player has will be cleared. When the player gets three misses, they receive a Game Over. Game A has two lions, while Game B has three.", "platform": "Nintendo Game & Watch", "release_date": "April 29, 1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nintendo EAD", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Game_%26_Watch_games#Lion", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/112009-lion\n"}
