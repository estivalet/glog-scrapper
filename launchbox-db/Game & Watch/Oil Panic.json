{"altername_name": ["Game & Watch: Oil Panic"], "name": "Oil Panic", "overview": "The game is set in a gas station where a leaky pipe is dripping oil. A station employee must collect these drops in a bucket and dump them into his boss's oil drum so that he may take them to the cars waiting beside the defunct gas pumps. He also needs to be quick, as the dripping oil is right above flammable sources that will cause a major fire if the droplets made contact with them (specifically, a smoking ashtray as well as two lit stoves). The bucket can hold only three drops of oil. If a drop is missed, if the bucket overflows, or if the employee dumps his bucket anywhere but in his boss's drum, he loses one of four lives.", "platform": "Nintendo Game & Watch", "release_date": "May 28, 1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nintendo EAD", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.06", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Game_%26_Watch_games#Oil_Panic", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/112012-oil-panic\n"}
