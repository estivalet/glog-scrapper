{"altername_name": ["Deluxe Football"], "name": "Deluxe Football With Instant Replay", "overview": "A full featured LED football game. Huge screen, nice controls, instant replay, many plays to choose from, and even a half time show. Has a patented 'playmaker' control scheme where you can choose your play without your opponent seeing what direction you pressed.
