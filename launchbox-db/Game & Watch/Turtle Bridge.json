{"altername_name": ["Game & Watch: Turtle Bridge"], "name": "Turtle Bridge", "overview": "The player receives items and must cross a bridge of five turtles to deliver the items to the receiver on the other side of a lake. Each time the player delivers an item, they earn three points. On the way back to the home bank to grab the next item, the player earns from two to 12 extra points depending on how fast they return. However, the turtles at times will go down into the lake to eat fish, and if the player jumps onto or stays on a descending turtle, that player will fall into the lake and lose a life. Also, the player might need to wait for the receiver to appear and cannot return to the home bank while carrying an item. If the player reaches 200 or 500 points without any misses, then no fish will appear for the turtles for 20 to 40 seconds. If the player has any misses at either score, every miss will be cleared instead. The player receives a Game Over when they lose three lives. In Game A, most fish appear to the left and right of the center turtle, and it does not descend unless the player stays on it too long. In Game B, however, fish will appear more frequently for the center turtle.", "platform": "Nintendo Game & Watch", "release_date": "February 1, 1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nintendo", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.93", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Game_%26_Watch_games#Turtle_Bridge", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/79203-turtle-bridge\n"}
