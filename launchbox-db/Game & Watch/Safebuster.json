{"altername_name": ["Safe Buster", "Game & Watch: Safe Buster"], "name": "Safebuster", "overview": "A bandit named the Wily Bomber is dropping bombs from the roof of a bank onto a safe, and the player as the bank guard must catch them in a pipe. The player receives a point for every bomb they catch. The pipe can hold only three bombs, however, so the player must dispose of them in the right or left corner as they pile up. As the player disposes of bombs in the left corner, flaming torches will appear from the blast, which will eventually stop by themselves. If the player throws enough bombs into the left corner, the flaming torches will set fire to the Wily Bomber's arsenal, blowing it up and blasting him away, awarding the player 20 points. If a bomb hits the safe, the safe will blow open, and then the Wily Bomber will climb down and steal the money, penalizing the player with a miss. At 200 points, any misses the player has will be canceled. When the player gets three misses, they receive a Game Over.", "platform": "Nintendo Game & Watch", "release_date": "January 6, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nintendo EAD", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.33", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Game_%26_Watch_games#Safebuster", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFWZ4NWVnDk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/112015-safebuster\n"}
