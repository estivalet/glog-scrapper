The device's primary controls consist of a circle shaped 4-way directional pad on the left, and a singular button on the right. In the game the player controls the 4 titular turtles as they fight off against Shredder's minions on the streets of New York City. The game is controlled by using the d-pad to move and the right button to attack. If the turtle the player is controlling runs out of health, they are out of commission and the player is forced to switch to another. If all for are out then it's game over. The game consists of 5 stages where the player walks to the right, attacking enemies and jumping over obstacles. In the middle and the end of each stage the player faces off against a boss. Once the player reaches the end of a stage their health is restored and they're given a choice to switch to a different turtle.", "platform": "Nintendo Game & Watch", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/372763-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-3-shredders-last-stand\n"}
