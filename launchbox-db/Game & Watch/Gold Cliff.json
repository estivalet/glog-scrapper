{"altername_name": ["Game & Watch: Gold Cliff"], "name": "Gold Cliff", "overview": "Gold Cliff is a Game & Watch game released as a part of the Multi Screen series on October 19, 1988. It is a dual-screen single-player Game & Watch with a light blue case and colorful printed metal plate on the cover. It opens like a compact, with an upper and lower screen. The player controls an Indiana Jones-type archaeologist character who is on a mission to acquire treasure. Stone platforms appear and disappear in a pattern, and the player must jump across them to reach a key at the top of the screen and gain entry to the temple. Action speeds as the game continues. It was one of only two Game & Watch games that included a \"continue\" feature, which allowed a player to continue the game, with a loss of points, from the last place where they were killed.", "platform": "Nintendo Game & Watch", "release_date": "October 19, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nintendo", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.33", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Game_%26_Watch_games#Gold_Cliff", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/114258-gold-cliff\n"}
