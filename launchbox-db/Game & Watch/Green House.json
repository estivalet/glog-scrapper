{"altername_name": ["Game & Watch: Green House"], "name": "Green House", "overview": "The player controls a bug exterminator only referred to as the \"Fumigator\" in the manual, and the objective is to spray worms and spiders that try to eat the flowers in a greenhouse. The worms crawl along vines on the top screen, while the spiders crawl along webs on the bottom screen, and the player will have to try to hit them with a spray before they reach the flowers (which would then die, giving the player a miss). The spiders are a little more difficult to defeat, as they are killed only when sprayed closest to a flower (they simply back away when sprayed farther away). The game is a two-level one with a ladder connecting the two parts (which otherwise offer almost identical action).", "platform": "Nintendo Game & Watch", "release_date": "December 6, 1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nintendo EAD", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.17", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Game_%26_Watch_games#Green_House", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/112007-green-house\n"}
