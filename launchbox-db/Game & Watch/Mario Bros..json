{"altername_name": ["Game & Watch: Mario Bros."], "name": "Mario Bros.", "overview": "Mario Bros. is a Game & Watch game released as a part of the Multi Screen series on March 14, 1983. It is a dual-screen single-player Game & Watch with a maroon body. It opens like a Japanese book (to the right), with a left and right screen. Mario and Luigi are working in a bottling plant, on either side of several stacked conveyor belts. The object of the game is to move boxes of bottles through the machine without dropping any. Each brother can climb a ladder to one of three positions. Mario receives a box at the bottom right, and must be in his lowest position to move it into the bottling machine. The box moves left through the machine, to Luigi, who must be in his lowest position to move it to the next level, which moves it to the right, to Mario's middle position, who raises it to the next level. The box moves to Luigi's middle position, then to Mario's highest position, and finally to Luigi's highest position, where Luigi throws the box onto a truck. When the truck is full, the Brothers have a short break, before getting back to work. Successfully moving a box up one level earns the player 1 point, and loading the truck with eight boxes earns 10 points, for a total of 58 points for all the boxes in the truck. However, if a Brother isn't there to catch a box, it falls to the floor and breaks, angering the Brothers' supervisor, resulting in a miss. The third miss ends the game.", "platform": "Nintendo Game & Watch", "release_date": "March 14, 1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nintendo EAD", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.57", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Game_%26_Watch_games#Mario_Bros.", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/84772-mario-bros\n"}
