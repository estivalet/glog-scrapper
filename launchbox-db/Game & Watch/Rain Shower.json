{"altername_name": ["Game & Watch: Rain Shower"], "name": "Rain Shower", "overview": "The player must help the character move the clotheslines from getting his hanged clothes wet. When the player reaches 100 points, it stops raining for a brief moment before raining again, and the player receives 10 points. As the player progresses in the game, the raindrops will fall faster. If a raindrop hits a shirt, the boy will angrily wring it out and the player will get a miss. If the player gets 300 points without any misses, the points will be worth double until the player does get a miss. If the player has any misses at said score, all misses will be removed instead. On hard mode, a crow will appear and move the clotheslines, similar to Waluigi's role in Modern Mode. When the player gets three misses, they receive a Game Over.", "platform": "Nintendo Game & Watch", "release_date": "August 1, 1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nintendo EAD", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.79", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Game_%26_Watch_games#Rain_Shower", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDZKoPiPGkc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/112016-rain-shower\n"}
