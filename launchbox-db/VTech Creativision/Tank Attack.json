{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tank Attack", "overview": "You are a tank commander! You are engaged in a battle to the death with another Tank commander who has the same weapons as you have, so only your superior skill can win the day! More dangers than the eye can see! Besides enemy tanks, there are many dangers to contend with. There may be hidden minefields that you will never see until it is too late. The terrain itself can prove deadly. A fall in the deep water of the river could be the end of you. In addition, your treacherous enemy can switch tanks, and attack from a completely different direction with no warning.", "platform": "VTech CreatiVision", "release_date": "January 1, 1981", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "VTech", "publishers": "VTech", "genres": "Vehicle Simulation", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.62", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqAcM2-OKo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72245-tank-attack\n"}
