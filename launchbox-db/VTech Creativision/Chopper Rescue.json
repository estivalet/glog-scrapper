{"altername_name": [], "name": "Chopper Rescue", "overview": "A whole country is depending on you! You have to do some of the trickiest flying that's ever been done over three types of terrain. But you can't let anything stop you. You have to pick up vital medical supplies and deliver them where disaster has struck. If you fail, thousands will die. Fly like you've never flown before.

In order to make the drop you have to have pinpoint accuracy and very steady nerves.", "platform": "VTech CreatiVision", "release_date": "January 1, 1982", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "VTech", "publishers": "VTech", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3TceBIO2uU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72217-chopper-rescue\n"}
