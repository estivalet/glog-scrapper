Then players must move their cursor around in order to paint the screen with their color. The cartridge of Energy Quiz was found off a flea market in Montreal (Canada) in the early 2000s by Toby Saint Aubin. It seems to be similar to Power Grabber. It was made for children play areas at Canadian nuclear power plants to keep the kids busy while the parents toured the plant.", "platform": "ColecoVision", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sydney Development", "publishers": "Sydney Development", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164014-energy-quiz\n"}
