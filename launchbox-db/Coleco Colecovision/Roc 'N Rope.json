{"altername_name": [], "name": "Roc 'N Rope", "overview": "Your are a mountain climber who must avoid cavemen, dinosaurs and pterodactyls as he climbs up the cliff-sides. Your goal in each level is to climb up and reach a mystical bird with great plumage, while staying one step above the bonus timer which determines how long you may stay on each level. The mountain climber has only one ability; to shoot rope at 45 degree angles which he may then climb up to other platforms. His other action is a stun beam which will allow him to walk past enemies who get too close; but will only work horizontally from him. As for power-ups, on each level is (usually 2) a flashing diamond power-up which will make him invincible and allow him to defeat monsters. Also as a power-up are glowing treasures of some kind which are worth extra points.", "platform": "ColecoVision", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Coleco Industries", "publishers": "Coleco Industries", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.42", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roc%27n_Rope", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGkpIwma3PY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/3799-roc-n-rope\n"}
