{"altername_name": [], "name": "Star Jacker", "overview": "Only a true Star Jacker can tackle this mission! You are the leader of a squadron of space fighters. You have been ordered by your superiors to fly over alien territory and destroy their space bunkers, as well as their fleets of space drones. Destroy a space bunker and you can bypass the rest of the enemy installation and return to your transport ship. You start with a squadron of four fighters, and each time a fighter is destroyed, your squadron becomes smaller, and your firepower is reduced as a result. How long can you survive against the increasingly aggresive alien forces, in this challenging adaptation of the Sega arcade game?", "platform": "ColecoVision", "release_date": "2021", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Team Pixelboy", "publishers": "Team Pixelboy", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDIEY4gUe4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/167591-star-jacker\n"}
