{"altername_name": [], "name": "Death Race", "overview": "Players control an on-screen car with a steering wheel and an acceleration pedal. The object is to run down \"gremlins\" who are fleeing the vehicle. As the player hits them, they scream or squeal and are replaced on-screen by tombstones. This increases the challenge of the game as the screen clutters up and the player has to avoid the tombstones.", "platform": "ColecoVision", "release_date": "2011", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "CollectorVision", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQlfK9Sssso", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/9893-death-race\n"}
