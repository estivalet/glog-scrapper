{"altername_name": [], "name": "Traffic Jam", "overview": "You're Sandy Olson, a young and beautiful traffic policewoman in charge of helping hundreds of drivers face the unavoidable traffic jam caused by summer roadworks. One of those drivers is Danny Zucku, an executive who works for a very important company. He has been your friend for some time, but now you feel you want to be something more than only his friend. So you make an extra effort to help him get to his job on time, by moving the cars and trucks around the area to clear a path for Danny's sportscar. As the days pass, the traffic jams get worse, and helping Danny becomes quite a challenging puzzle for you. If Danny cannot escape the morning traffic, he may get fired!", "platform": "ColecoVision", "release_date": "2017", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Imanok", "publishers": "Team Pixelboy", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/132762-traffic-jam\n"}
