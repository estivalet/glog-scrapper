{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mouse Trap", "overview": "Mouse Trap is a 1981 arcade maze game developed by Exidy. The game design is similar to Pac-Man, replacing Pac-Man with a mouse, the dots with cheese, the ghosts with cats, and the power pills with bones. The unique element of Mouse Trap is that color-coded doors in the maze can be toggled by pressing a button of the same color. The game was ported by Coleco as a ColecoVision launch title in 1982, then later to the Intellivision and Atari 2600.", "platform": "ColecoVision", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Coleco Industries", "publishers": "Coleco Industries", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.26", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse_Trap_(arcade_game)", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui7io_s8kB8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/3790-mouse-trap\n"}
