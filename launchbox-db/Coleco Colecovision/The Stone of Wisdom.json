{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Stone of Wisdom", "overview": "Only you can reassemble the lost Stone of Wisdom! Long ago, an enchanted stone was carved by the ancient egyptian gods, as a vessel to transmit their wisdom to mankind. However, the stone quickly became a coveted object for those who sought power. After several wars waged to protect the stone, a pharaoh finally decided that such power should not be left in the hands of mortals. So he had the stone shattered into four pieces, and these pieces were burried deep into sacred pyramids. However, the gods were not pleased with the pharaoh's decision, and they cursed the sacred pyramids with an infestation of deadly creatures and magical traps. Realizing his mistake near the end of his life, the pharaoh gave his son a mission: To enter the four cursed pyramids, with a sword and his cunning as his only weapons, and retrieve all four pieces of the stone. Only then may the pharaoh's family regain the favor of the gods!", "platform": "ColecoVision", "release_date": "2015", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Casio", "publishers": "Team Pixelboy", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/122345-the-stone-of-wisdom\n"}
