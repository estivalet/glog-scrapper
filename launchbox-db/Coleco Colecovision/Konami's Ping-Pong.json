{"altername_name": [], "name": "Konami's Ping-Pong", "overview": "Experience the fast-paced thrills of Ping-Pong! In this challenging and realistic 8-bit simulation of Ping-Pong, you will need fast reflexes and good timing. Create strategies to defeat the CPU or a friend. You can use \"drive\" and \"cut\" techniques to return the ball, allowing you to control speed and to dump the ball to undefended spots on the opponent's court. And if your opponent hits an easy \"floater\" back to you, get your timing down and smash it back! As an added bonus, Konami's Billiards is also accessible in this ColecoVision game cartridge!", "platform": "ColecoVision", "release_date": "2011", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Team Pixelboy", "publishers": "Team Pixelboy", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/132836-konamis-ping-pong\n"}
