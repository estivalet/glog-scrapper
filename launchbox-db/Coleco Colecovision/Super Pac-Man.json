{"altername_name": [], "name": "Super Pac-Man", "overview": "Nothing can stand between Pac-Man and his food! Pac-Man is back! While he was away, the ghosts have been harvesting fruits and are keeping them hidden behind locked doors inside their maze. But that won't keep Pac-Man away for very long, especially with the ghosts carelessly leaving the keys lying around, and with Pac-Man having a new SUPER trick up his sleeve! In this adaptation of the famous arcade game, you play as Pac-Man, and your goal is to gobble up all the fruits while evading the ghosts. Collect keys to open locked doors. Eat a Power pellet to gain the ability to gobble the ghosts for a short time. Eat a Super pellet and you will grow into the unstoppable Super Pac-Man!", "platform": "ColecoVision", "release_date": "2016", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Team Pixelboy", "publishers": "Team Pixelboy", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.38", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/132769-super-pac-man\n"}
