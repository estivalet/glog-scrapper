{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cold Blood", "overview": "You are PacSnake, a first-rank member of the glorious PacHound group, and you've been assigned to an important mission. Your orders are to break into the Ghost Heaven fortress, a high security area full of evil ghosts. Once inside, you have to eat all the blips (i.e. the yellow dots) scattered across the area. Try to avoid the patrolling ghosts, as they take no prisonners! Gobble up power icons that give you special powers for a limited time. Find keycards and other items to advance in your mission. Contact your superior over the radio at any time to get clues and intel. When all areas are clear, your mission will be complete. Good luck, soldier!", "platform": "ColecoVision", "release_date": "2017", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Paxanga Soft", "publishers": "Team Pixelboy", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/132860-cold-blood\n"}
