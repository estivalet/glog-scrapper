This game is a really solid, two-player platforming title with 20+ levels to explore. Despite it being on the ColecoVision, it has a lot of features you'd see in the more high powered arcade games back in the day including a title screen and a high score screen.", "platform": "ColecoVision", "release_date": "August 10, 2001", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Digital Press", "publishers": "Digital Press", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "1.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWFwpG3li3A", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/57229-ms-space-fury\n"}
