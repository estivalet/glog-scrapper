{"altername_name": ["The Yolk's on You"], "name": "The Yolk's on You", "overview": "In this game you control a chicken who must run around the farm collecting her eggs and putting them back in the coop. Trying to stop you are various predators such as snakes, birds and a cunning fox. You also have to be careful not to smash the eggs as you push them back to safety. If you take too long the eggs hatch into chicks and these little death merchants are much more difficult to catch! Once you collect all the eggs/chicks it's game over.", "platform": "ColecoVision", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Fox Video Games", "publishers": "Unreleased Prototype", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83383-the-yolks-on-you\n"}
