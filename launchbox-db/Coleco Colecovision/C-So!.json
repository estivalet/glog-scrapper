{"altername_name": [], "name": "C-So!", "overview": "Who says being a rich kid is easy? You would think that being a rich kid spoiled beyond belief is a dream come true, but young Comy would tell you otherwise. Commy doesn't have many friends, but he does have a hobby that keeps him busy: He's a master playground designer. His parents, wanting him to develop his talents and hopefully attract a few friends, bought empty warehouses in which Comy has been placing see-saws and trampolines to create truly wonderful playgrounds for kids to play in. However, his playgrounds are attracting the wrong kind of \"friends\". Bullies have been trespassing and it falls to Comy to get rid of them. His parents also asked him to pick up the fruits they left behind, so Comy certainly has his work cut out for him!", "platform": "ColecoVision", "release_date": "2017", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Team Pixelboy", "publishers": "Team Pixelboy", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=017l5-oHDLY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/132853-c-so\n"}
