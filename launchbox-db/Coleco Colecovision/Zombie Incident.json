Hamartia, the great citadel, had become a symbol of human sin: Pride, envy, anger, sloth, greed, gluttony and lust. After centuries of excesses its penance was to come. In the dark of night, chaos invaded everything. Beasts just stood there, screaming. Nothing was as before! No one sane would go to that place! And the fools who dared... never returned! Nobody can explain what is happening there, but whatever is causing it... should remain there!! As the heroine of this story, you've set out to recover the eight Golden Stars and bring back the ancient wisdom. Be careful as you explore the citadel, because if you get lost, no one will come to rescue you!!", "platform": "ColecoVision", "release_date": "2017", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nene Franz", "publishers": "Team Pixelboy", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/132747-zombie-incident\n"}
