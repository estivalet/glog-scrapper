{"altername_name": ["Pac-Man"], "name": "Pac Man", "overview": "Pac-Man is an action maze chase video game; the player controls the eponymous character through an enclosed maze. The objective of the game is to eat all of the dots placed in the maze while avoiding four colored ghosts \u2014 Blinky (red), Pinky (pink), Inky (cyan), and Clyde (orange) \u2014 that pursue him. When Pac-Man eats all of the dots, the player advances to the next level. If Pac-Man makes contact with a ghost, he will lose a life; the game ends when all lives are lost. It was not released on the ColecoVision, only a prototype from 1983 exists. This port of Pac-Man was actually completed, and had many of the aspects of Namco's original Pac-Man. It is superior to most other ports by Atarisoft.", "platform": "ColecoVision", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atari", "publishers": "Atarisoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.38", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtkeaM9LEJ8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/45664-pac-man\n"}
