{"altername_name": [], "name": "Space Panic", "overview": "A game remarkably similar to Lode Runner, you play an astronaut with limited oxygen (time) chased around by various space aliens. Your only method of dealing with these multicolored threats from space is to dig a hole, lure it into a hole and then manually fill up the hole with the alien in it. Dropping aliens on top of other aliens earns you extra points and eliminates both. Levels get progressively harder and enemies grow faster.", "platform": "ColecoVision", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Universal", "publishers": "Coleco Industries", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Panic", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIoOGTCJ3R8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/10036-space-panic\n"}
