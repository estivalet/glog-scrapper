{"altername_name": ["B.C.'s Quest for Tires II: Grog's Revenge"], "name": "B.C.'s Quest for Tires II: Grog's Revenge", "overview": "Thor, the single-wheeling caveman, must gather up enough shells on the mountaintop he's traversing in order to pay the toll to cross the bridge to the next mountain. Along the way he must contend with rocks, potholes, rolling dinosaurs that like to eat his wheels, and that hairy being called Grog who will blast Thor into oblivion if they get too close to each other. Use the tunnels to go from one ledge to another, but be careful of the obstacles that lie in wait in the dark.", "platform": "ColecoVision", "release_date": "December 31, 1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sydney Development", "publishers": "Sierra On-Line", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B.C._II:_Grog%27s_Revenge", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EqowtpQfE8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/41222-bcs-quest-for-tires-ii-grogs-revenge\n"}
