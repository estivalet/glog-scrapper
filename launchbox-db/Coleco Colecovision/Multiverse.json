One day he's happily helping his dad in his laboratory, the next he's saving him from his own devices! The latest incident involves a portal that allows Dr Scott to travel between two parallel worlds, which he named Terra (our own world) and Fable. Dr Scott ventured into Fable all by himself, and radio contact was soon lost. Now it's up to Monty - and his fearless dog Nicemoon - to rescue Dr Scott by travelling between the two worlds and solving the mysteries of Fable. But Monty will have to be extra careful, as Fable is filled with dangerous creatures and traps! Armed with such weapons as slingshots and marbles, Monty will have to use his brains to stay safe and locate his father, and he can also trade places with Nicemoon to explore Fable even further!", "platform": "ColecoVision", "release_date": "2019", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hikaru Games", "publishers": "Team Pixelboy", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/132814-multiverse\n"}
