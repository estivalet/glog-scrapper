Now it's time for you to repel the attack and save the planet, by launching a surprise attack of your own into the alien trenches where the boss ships are stationned while they get ready for the final invasion.

Can you destroy the bulk of the enemy forces before they launch their attack?", "platform": "ColecoVision", "release_date": "2017", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Imanok", "publishers": "Team Pixelboy", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/132788-shmup\n"}
