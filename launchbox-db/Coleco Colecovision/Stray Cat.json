I've spent the day wandering around with my friends, looking for some food and having fun... but I've suddenly remembered I have a date with Iris, the cutest kitty of the downtown area!! I'm already late and I have a long way to go, so I decided to race across the city rooftops to get to Iris' penthouse faster...

I'll show you why they call me Flash!!", "platform": "ColecoVision", "release_date": "2017", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Imanok", "publishers": "Team Pixelboy", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.12", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBeB90vXYRU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/132777-stray-cat\n"}
