{"altername_name": [], "name": "Fortune Builder", "overview": "Gameplay involves developing a rural area with various businesses such as factories, resorts, stadiums, casinos and campgrounds. Proximity to certain types of businesses increase the cash flow coming from them, while putting other types of business too close together will negatively impact their profitability. Every few seconds a news ticker will announce an item that will temporarily increase or decrease the profits from a certain business, such as new laws requiring expensive new safety measures in factories or Bigfoot sightings scaring off attendees from resorts. On the other hand an extremely popular movie or TV show might drive crowds at theaters or casinos. The game includes multiple difficulty settings determining factors such as starting capital and the financial goal set for that scenario's win condition. Two players can compete. This predates Sim City by nearly 10 years, but must have inspired the makers of SimCity.", "platform": "ColecoVision", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Coleco Industries", "publishers": "Coleco Industries", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.89", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/iNuWDlzBE4o", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/9941-fortune-builder\n"}
