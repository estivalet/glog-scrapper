Pull up a chair and play a few hands of Blackjack or Poker. Minimum bet is $1 and maximum is $499 at the BlackJack table, whereas over on the 5-Card Stud Poker table the sky is the limit. Up to 4 people can play simultaneously, or if you're a little shy you can always go one-on-one with the dealer. Speaking of which, don't forget to give Max, your dealer, a nice tip, or you never know what kind of cards he'll deal out in your next hand.", "platform": "ColecoVision", "release_date": "December 1, 1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Coleco", "publishers": "Coleco", "genres": "Casino", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.8", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Uston#Video_games_and_computers", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icubKTt9iPE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/9956-ken-uston-blackjackpoker\n"}
