{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gyruss", "overview": "Gyruss is a shoot 'em up arcade game. The game was ported from Konami's 1981 arcade version to ColecoVision by Parker Brothers in 1984. The gameplay is similar to that of Galaga but presented in a forced 3D perspective, with the player's ship facing 'into' the screen and able to move around the perimeter of an implicit circle. The scrolling starfield of earlier space shooter games is arranged to fit the 3D perspective, with the stars coming into view at the centre of the screen and flying outward, giving the impression of the player's ship moving through space.", "platform": "ColecoVision", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Parker Brothers", "publishers": "Parker Brothers", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.96", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyruss", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/FNdtnrSWyvo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/9732-gyruss\n"}
