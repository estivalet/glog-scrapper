{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mappy", "overview": "Goro's on the loose! Call Mappy the police-mouse! \"First day on the job and this is what I have to deal with?\" says Mappy the police-mouse, as he watches fat-cat kingpin Goro and his mischievous cat burglars run amock in fancy downtown mansions, stealing everything they can get their feline paws on! Mappy wants to do his job and uphold the law, but he quickly realizes that a mouse is no match for a gang of cats, and since police backup isn't coming, Mappy decides to do the next best thing, which is to grab all the valuables in each mansion before Goro's gang does, in order to store them in a safe place. So Mappy's job quickly becomes a game of cat and mouse(!) as he uses trampolines and doors to stay one step ahead of the cat burglars!", "platform": "ColecoVision", "release_date": "2016", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Namco", "publishers": "Team Pixelboy", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/132826-mappy\n"}
