{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mindwalls", "overview": "Dear colleague, thank you for accepting our proposal. Our research on the development of a device to explore people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mind is on the verge of reaching its goal and you are honored of leading the first test on our patient. She is volunteered since there is no treatment for the mental disorder she suffers from. To be honest, the real reason for this experience is more financial than therapeutic as there is nearly no money left for the project and even if the device works, it is far from being fully functional. However, if we succeed in treating mental disorders, our investors would be reassured and we may continue our work. You were chosen because you know better than anyone how to use our device. The future of our research is in your hands!", "platform": "ColecoVision", "release_date": "2013", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nicolas Campion", "publishers": "Collectorvision Games", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/132821-mindwalls\n"}
