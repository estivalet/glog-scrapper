{"altername_name": [], "name": "Majikazo", "overview": "Help young magician Flush clean up his rooms! Flush, an apprentice magician, was doing some cleaning while his master was away, and found an old grimoire which his master believed had been lost. Flush couldn't resist trying some of the spells in the grimoire, but things got ugly and the castle was quickly overrun by dangerous magical creatures, including an evil twin of Flush! Now you must help Flush clean up his mess with the help of magic spells locked inside magic boxes. Certain creatures are immune to certain types of magic, and this will force you to play strategically. If all else fails, you can open the door to the next room of the castle by collecting the 4 keys in the current room. Can you get this dangerous job done before your master's return? Do the best you can and try to beat your high score!", "platform": "ColecoVision", "release_date": "2016", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Lemonize", "publishers": "Team Pixelboy", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/132827-majikazo\n"}
