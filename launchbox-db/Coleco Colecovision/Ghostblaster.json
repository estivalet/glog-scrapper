{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ghostblaster", "overview": "You are a fearless GhostBlaster. Your job is to help your clients by ridding their homes of unwanted ghosts and phantoms, and the magic gems that attract them. Be careful, these prank-playing ghosts and phantoms not only affect the home's structure, but they will be quick to attack if they think for even one second you are trying to stop them or remove their magical gems. This is Daniel Bienvenu's finest work and features the most impressive and smoothest screen scrolling to be found on any Colecovision game at 30fps- a REAL technical accomplishment! Plus, it features the excellent Ghost Busters theme song! GhostBlaster includes an offset printed box, manual and label.", "platform": "ColecoVision", "release_date": "2006", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Daniel Bienvenu", "publishers": "Collectorvision Games", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/95182-ghostblaster\n"}
