{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bomb'n Blast", "overview": "A random sequence of shapes falls down the playing field. The objective of the game is to manipulate these shapes, by moving each one sideways and rotating it by 90 degree units, with the aim of creating a horizontal line of blocks without gaps. When such a line is created with at least a bomb in it, it explodes and destroys surrounding bricks, and any brick above the deleted lines will fall. The more bombs you get in your lines, the bigger the explosion is by chain reaction. As the game progresses, each level causes the shapes to fall faster, and the game ends when the stack of shapes reaches the top of the playing field and no new shape is able to enter or when you succeed in clearing the 25 levels.", "platform": "ColecoVision", "release_date": "2011", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Michel Louvet", "publishers": "Collectorvision Games", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/132847-bombn-blast\n"}
