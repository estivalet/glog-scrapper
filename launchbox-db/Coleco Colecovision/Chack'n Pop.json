{"altername_name": [], "name": "Chack'n Pop", "overview": "Jealous of the love between Mr. Chack'n and Miss Chack'n, the Mighta wizards construct a plan to steal their love and break them apart. You are Mr Chack\u00e2\u20ac\u2122n, a small yellow creature with extendable legs. You must traverse a series of single-screen mazes. You are capable of walking on floors or ceilings but not walls. You can climb steps and traverse high walls by extending your legs until you are tall enough to pass onto the next step. The evil Monstas will attempt to stop you as you make your way through 14 mazes in an effort to free your hearts from the cages with your bombs. Fortunately you are capable of throwing hand grenades to your left or right which, after a short period, explode into a cloud of killing smoke.", "platform": "ColecoVision", "release_date": "2011", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Collectorvision Games", "publishers": "Collectorvision Games", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/132855-chackn-pop\n"}
