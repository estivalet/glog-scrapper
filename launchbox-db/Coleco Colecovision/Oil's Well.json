{"altername_name": [], "name": "Oil's Well", "overview": "The player attempts to manage an oil drilling operation and collect oil, while evading subterranean creatures. The player can advance through eight different levels, using four directional control buttons to move the drill head, and pressing a button to quickly retract it. Extend your oil-mining robotic arm deep below the earth's crust to mine oil and line your pockets. But watch out for the monstrous bugs that lie in wait for you -- one touch of them to the robotic arm and you lose a life!", "platform": "ColecoVision", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sierra On-Line, Inc.", "publishers": "Sierra On-Line, Inc.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.05", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil%27s_Well", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/12515-oils-well\n"}
