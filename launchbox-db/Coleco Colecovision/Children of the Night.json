{"altername_name": [], "name": "Children of the Night", "overview": "Can the most unlikely hero save us from eternal darkness? \"Centuries ago the Night had a son. He had many names, but only one still echoes in the corridors of History: Count Vlad Drakul. His tragic existence, equally pervaded by suffering and evil, came to an end in 1899 when a young scholar by the name of Abraham Van Helsing defeated him. But no human can truly kill what is not alive in the first place, and with time, even Death itself can die. Forty years have passed since then. Now, the Child of the Night is back amongst the living. What could have caused his return? As it turns out, Drakul's awakening coincides with the coming of a demon who promises to spread chaos and darkness across the world, and Drakul's fate is tied to this dark monster. Can our world be saved by the Children of the Night?\"", "platform": "ColecoVision", "release_date": "2017", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hikaru Games", "publishers": "Team Pixelboy", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7C13JT0lFCY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/132858-children-of-the-night\n"}
