{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mecha-8", "overview": "The Earth is under attack! Prepare Mecha-8 for battle! A hero's job is never done, and today perfectly illustrates this rule: A hostile race of aliens of unknown origins have launched a vicious surprise attack on Earth's major cities! Tricia Thunder, the best mech pilot available, has been called away from her vacation to board the Mecha-8, a highly resilient war mech armed with powerful weapons. Tricia's mission is clear: She must first repel the alien onslaught to save as many civilian lives as possible, and then locate the command center of the alien menace and destroy it. But can Tricia do this single-handedly with Mecha-8? She's fully confident that she can, and you're going to help her prove it!", "platform": "ColecoVision", "release_date": "2013", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Team Pixelboy", "publishers": "Team Pixelboy", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/132823-mecha-8\n"}
