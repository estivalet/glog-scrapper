{"altername_name": [], "name": "Vanguard", "overview": "In Vanguard, you pilot a ship that must cruise through the cave of the Gond. The cave is divided up into various sections. Each section has different features to it, as well as an orientation. It might be horizontal, or vertical, or even diagonal. Players can fire any one of the four guns mounted on the ship, each of which fire in a different direction. Players might also encounter energy power-ups which make them invincible briefly. The ultimate goal is to reach the end of each cave and destroy the Gond once and for all.", "platform": "ColecoVision", "release_date": "2019", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Centuri", "publishers": "Collectorvision Games", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/132758-vanguard\n"}
