{"altername_name": [], "name": "Space Fury", "overview": "Space Fury is a multi-directional shooter game released on for Colecovision in 1983 and is based on the 1981 arcade game created by Sega. The arcade version game was an early example of color vector graphics and it also featured speech synthesis, both of which are not features in the Colecovision release. The gameplay is similar to Asteroids in that you have one screen of space that wraps back on itself and your ship can only thrust and fire. However, whereas in Asteroids you faced pieces of rock that couldn't give chase, Space Fury instead provides alien vessels that will hunt you down. Each alien vessel starts in 4 pieces at diagonal corners which will try to join together. Shooting any of these pieces before is possible and will make things easier for your player. When one or more pieces reaches the center point, it combines with other pieces there and begins to fire upon and give chase to your vessel. There's only one screen of space, so your tactics are limited. However your vessel is not completely basic. Provided from the beginning are three superstructures, of which you can choose one, that provide additional firepower to your ship.", "platform": "ColecoVision", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega Enterprises", "publishers": "Coleco Industries", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.73", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Fury", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyfNiBXPlzs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/3802-space-fury\n"}
