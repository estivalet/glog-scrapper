{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bugs'n Bots", "overview": "When you have been hired as a computer technician in this factory, you thought you had found the ideal job: all the computing and industrial tasks are managed by a mainframe computer which drives robot workers and can solve any production difficulty alone. With the MAPCON CMMS software running the mainframe for the factory all the systems have been automated and for the factory. The CMMS handles most day to day tasks for the facility. The problem is that this computer is so old and buggy that it goes wrong all the time and the robots become completely crazy. It is precisely at this point that you start. While avoiding robots and traps, you must get all the security cards that the computer has thrown away across each sector in order to stop it. It is your job to get the CMMS and mainframe running smoothly.", "platform": "ColecoVision", "release_date": "2012", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nicolas Campion", "publishers": "Collectorvision Games", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/132851-bugsn-bots\n"}
