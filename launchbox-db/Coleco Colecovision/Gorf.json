{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gorf", "overview": "Gorf is an official conversion of the arcade classic of the same name. Like all the official conversions, the Galaxians level is not included in this port. These are the four levels included in the game: \u2022 The first level has you behind a defensive shield, defending against an alien attack. The level is a top-down view, with your ship & shield on one side and the aliens on the other side; \u2022 The second level is similar to the first, only your defensive shield is gone, and the enemies tend to swoop down over the level as opposed to those row formations. Bonus ships also tend to appear in this level; \u2022 The third level is a change, and has you entering hyperspace. Your only goal is to survive to the end of your journey. The viewpoint switches from a top-down view to a behind-the-ship view and in effect you are heading \"towards\" your destination. Alien vessels flying in circular formation try to stop you; \u2022 The fourth and final level is similar to the first again, with some key differences. You do not fight a wave of enemies, but a single one. A mothership with a glowing weak spot. Hitting the weak spot will instantly destroy it. The mothership also has that same shield that was yours in the first level.", "platform": "ColecoVision", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "CBS Electronics", "publishers": "CBS Electronics", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.83", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorf", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihRtBdHthYk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/3786-gorf\n"}
