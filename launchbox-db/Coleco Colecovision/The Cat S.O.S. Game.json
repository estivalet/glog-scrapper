{"altername_name": ["Caterpillar Scheduled Oil Sampling Game"], "name": "The Cat S.O.S. Game", "overview": "The Cat S.O.S game (Caterpillar scheduled oil sampling game)along with a colecovision was given to every cat dealership in 1983 to support the S.O.S. program. The customers would play it while waiting in the lobby. The game was made by the company Nuvatec. It was never sold commercially and could only be found exclusively in cat heavy equipment dealerships. The game consists of a bulldozer that rides around and pushes dirt. Each dirt pile represents a \"job\". To keep from exploding you have to send in oil samples to the cat dealership ,then you will be told if the oil is good or bad. If you fail to do this occasionally your oil will go bad and your bulldozer will explode. To clean the oil you have to go to the cat dealership. The goal of the game is to make the most money from finishing \"jobs\".", "platform": "ColecoVision", "release_date": "2013", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nuvatec, Inc.", "publishers": "Collectorvision Games", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyMzkSTOD8s", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/115884-the-cat-sos-game\n"}
