{"altername_name": [], "name": "Knight Lore", "overview": "What's more dreadful than a werewolf curse? Finding the ingredients of the cure! The legendary adventurer Saberman has fallen prey to a werewolf curse, and he has 40 days and nights to find a way to lift the curse before it becomes permanent! His research has led him to Knight Lore castle, home to Melkhior, a dying wizard. Melkhior has vowed to rid Saberman of his curse, but he is too weak to gather the ingredients of the cure, which are scattered all over his castle. As Saberman, you must explore Knight Lore castle, collect the required ingredients and bring them to the wizard. This wouldn't be so hard if the castle wasn't filled with traps and dangerous creatures that kill with a mere touch! You will need acute skills and intellect to stay out of harm's way and solve some intricate puzzles. Without your help, Saberman is doomed!", "platform": "ColecoVision", "release_date": "2016", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Team Pixelboy", "publishers": "Team Pixelboy", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/132840-knight-lore\n"}
