Many imitators and homages would follow.", "platform": "ColecoVision", "release_date": "February 1, 1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Coleco Industries", "publishers": "Coleco Industries", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.38", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choplifter", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/LDnLbcRX7ng", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/9882-choplifter\n"}
