{"altername_name": ["One-on-One", "One-on-One Basketball"], "name": "Julius Erving and Larry Bird Go One-on-One", "overview": "The player controls basketball star Julius Erving or Larry Bird in a game of one-on-one against another player or the computer. The game has excellent animation, personal fouls, a 24-second shot clock, jumpers, fall-aways, putbacks, and what is likely the first instant replay in video games. It allows for play to a certain score or timed games. On offense, a player can spin or shoot; on defense, attempt to block or steal the ball, with over aggressiveness penalized by fouls. A hard dunk can shatter the backboard, prompting a janitor to come out and sweep up the shards, directing censored complaints at the player in the process.", "platform": "ColecoVision", "release_date": "January 1, 1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Chris Oberth", "publishers": "Micro Fun", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.62", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/32667-julius-erving-and-larry-bird-go-one-on-one\n"}
