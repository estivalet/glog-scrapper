{"altername_name": [], "name": "Quest for the Golden Chalice", "overview": "Dragons and castles and bats... Oh my! The cowardly Prince of Larosia will need to face his deepest fears, as his kingdom has been overrun by a group of hungry dragons! Even worse, the evil mastermind behind this attack is none other than Mardok the wizard, who the Prince had banished a year before! The townspeople - including the royal guards - have all fled the kingdom, leaving the Prince alone to fend for himself, and even worse, Mardok has stolen the Golden Chalice, the greatest treasure of Larosia! It now falls to the Prince to restore the people's confidence in his royalty, and there's only one way to do it: He must return the Golden Chalice to the Yellow Castle! Guide the Prince as he runs across the kingdom, locating keys, a sword and other assorted objects, in an effort to locate the Golden Chalice and carry it back home. Don't let the dragons get too close, or they will have the Prince for lunch! Also be wary of the giant bat, who will steal objects and move them around, causing the Prince additional headaches!", "platform": "ColecoVision", "release_date": "2012", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Team Pixelboy", "publishers": "Team Pixelboy", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoXwu5P_7ng", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/132802-quest-for-the-golden-chalice\n"}
