{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dacman", "overview": "DacMan is an attempt to bring a version of Pac-Man to the ColecoVision. The game looks similar to Pac-Man but only has three ghosts. The game play is the same. Move about the maze, eating all the dots and avoiding the ghosts. If you eat a power pellet, the ghosts turn blue then you can eat them for points. Also on the cartridge, starting with version 1.3, is a hidden game called DacPong!. This is just like Pong except the ball is the Pac-Man character.", "platform": "ColecoVision", "release_date": "July 29, 2000", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Daniel Bienvenu", "publishers": "Collectorvision Games", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/127197-dacman\n"}
