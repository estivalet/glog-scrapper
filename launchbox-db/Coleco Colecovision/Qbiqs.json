Inside, dead pixels mutate into dangerous particles called QBIQS. These particles interfere with the path of cathode rays, so images do not display correctly.

Who is behind these dangerous mutations?", "platform": "ColecoVision", "release_date": "2019", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Z80ST Software", "publishers": "Team Pixelboy", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/132804-qbiqs\n"}
