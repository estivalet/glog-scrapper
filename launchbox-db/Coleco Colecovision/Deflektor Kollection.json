The name was changed to avoid a conflict with Atari's trademark regarding the name Breakout. We held a contest in our forums to solicit a new name, and Deflektor was suggested by neotokeo2001. Artist Francis Meunier then created a new logo for the game, which you can see in the pictures below.", "platform": "ColecoVision", "release_date": "", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133045-deflektor-kollection\n"}
