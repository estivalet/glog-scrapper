{"altername_name": [], "name": "Congo Bongo", "overview": "Congo Bongo is an isometric platform arcade game released by Sega in 1983 and ported to the ColecoVision by Coleco Industries in 1984. Congo Bongo has similar elements and gameplay to Nintendo's Donkey Kong from 1981, with the isometric perspective from Sega's Zaxxon released in Japan in late 1981. Both Congo Bongo and Donkey Kong involve primates who throw objects at the player from a vantage point atop a structure. Both games involve a large-nosed protagonist whose only ability is to jump. Both games have four different, single-screen stages. The goal of the first stage in both games is to climb to the top. Even the graphics of the bonus timer are similar to Donkey Kong's. The ColecoVision release is missing the \"Snake Lake\" level from the arcade version.", "platform": "ColecoVision", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Coleco Industries", "publishers": "Coleco Industries", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.55", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congo_Bongo", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uuq_DLltEU0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/9892-congo-bongo\n"}
