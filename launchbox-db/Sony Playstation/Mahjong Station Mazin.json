{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mahjong Station Mazin", "overview": "Mahjong Station Mazin is an early full-3D mahjong game. Ten heroes from the past and present, including a Greek warrior, a wild-west gunman, a 15th-century Romanian vampire, and a retro-futuristic robot, have been gathered together by the gods for a mahjong tournament. The game faithfully reproduces the 4-player variation of the ancient tile game, mixed with a highly-animated anime style where every move is reason to shout. The game includes two modes. In Campaign Mode, the player takes control of a young man named Katsuya Ibuki and must prove his worth to the God of Mahjong. There is also a Free Battle mode where the player can choose any character to play as. In addition to the featured 3D \"Virtual\" mode, there is also a \"Standard\" 2D mode that ditches the extra animations and voiceovers to streamline the gameplay.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "December 3, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Chat Noir", "publishers": "Sunsoft", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/135351-mahjong-station-mazin\n"}
