{"altername_name": ["PaRappa the Rapper: The Hip Hop Hero"], "name": "PaRappa the Rapper", "overview": "PARAPPA THE RAPPER is about a rapping dog named PaRappa and his friends PJ Berri, Sunny Funny, and Katy Kat. Appearing almost more like a cartoon than a game, it follows PaRappa's fascination with Sunny Funny, a sunflower. PaRappa will go through several rites of passage learning courage, getting a driving license, and going on dates. The crux of PaRappa lies in the rapping segments of the game. To get to the next stage, you must reproduce the raps of a number of teachers. Rapping is accomplished by pressing the correct buttons at the correct moments, all in time to the music. This may sound easy, and it is at first, but it gets more and more difficult as the game goes on. With impressive visuals, a memorable soundtrack, and a cast of oddball characters, PARAPPA THE RAPPER is a PlayStation classic.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "December 6, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "NanaOn-Sha", "publishers": "Sony Computer Entertainment", "genres": "Music", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.13", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PaRappa_the_Rapper", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/7493-parappa-the-rapper\n"}
