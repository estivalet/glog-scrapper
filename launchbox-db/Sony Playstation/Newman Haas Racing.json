{"altername_name": [], "name": "Newman/Haas Racing", "overview": "Newman/Haas presents racing in its purest form - no power-ups, shortcuts, or weapons here - and playing it requires equal parts patience, skill, and raw endurance. Those looking for an authentic Indy Car experience are in luck, as this is a game of remarkable depth and customizability. It offers a mind-boggling array of options - digital or analog control, single- or dual-player racing, four levels of difficulty, eleven tracks, 16 drivers, and a partridge in the pit stop. OK, I'm kidding about the last item, but it's obvious that Psygnosis doesn't think Indy Car racing is a laughing matter, and it's gone to great lengths to make Newman/Haas as realistic as possible.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "May 31, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Studio 33", "publishers": "Psygnosis", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/22918-newmanhaas-racing\n"}
