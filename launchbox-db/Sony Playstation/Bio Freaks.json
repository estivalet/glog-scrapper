{"altername_name": ["Bio F.R.E.A.K.S."], "name": "Bio Freaks", "overview": "This game is a 3D one-on-one fighter of extraordinary violence. Take control of one of many bionically-enhanced fighters, and fight in a dangerous interactive 3D environment. Most of the characters rely on distance attacks, which centres the game on strategic fighting rather than a boxing match; interacting with the hazardous environment adds hardship to the gameplay: while avoiding an opponent's gunfire by jetting off with your jetpack, you may just slam right into a buzzsaw coming out of the wall.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "April 30, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "M - Mature", "developers": "Saffire", "publishers": "Midway Home Entertainment", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.22", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bio_F.R.E.A.K.S.", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/29667-bio-freaks\n"}
