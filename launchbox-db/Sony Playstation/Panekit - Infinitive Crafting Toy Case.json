In the beginning, the game gives three vehicles in the player's inventory to choose from. So basically, the player drive around looking for parts and other equipment scattered around the terrain. Most of those parts are located in hard-to-reach places like on top of trees, on the summit of a high cliff, on an island right in the middle of the ocean, or even on top of a suspension bridge. Those parts the player collect are then added to the inventory so they can be used to build new self-designed vehicles.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "August 5, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Sony", "publishers": "Sony", "genres": "Sandbox", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/111805-panekit-infinitive-crafting-toy-case\n"}
