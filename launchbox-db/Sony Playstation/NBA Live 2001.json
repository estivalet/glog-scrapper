Improved trade system can involve up to 3 teams and 15 players. Improved \"player personality\" means you'll see players argue calls, celebrate a key basket, encourage their teammates, and much more. Also, play the legends such as Michael Jordan in 1-on-1 or 5-on-5 games. NBA Live 2001 provides the selection of real-life teams and players and the honest gameplay that fans have come to expect from the Electronic Arts NBA Live series of basketball games. The camera follows NBA superstars across the 3D court as they pass the ball, set up plays, and take the shot. NBA Live 2001 improves on the standards established by its predecessors with enhanced AI and better player models. The improved announcer commentary, more encompassing crowd noises, and more detailed action in the stands and on the bench make for a realistic, ambient arena. NBA Live 2001 also offers a challenge mode, in which players gain points by performing extraordinary feats like winning by a large margin or sinking several consecutive three-point shots. These challenge mode points can be used to unlock bonus teams and other special features in the game.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "October 16, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Electronic Arts Canada", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.29", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/33289-nba-live-2001\n"}
