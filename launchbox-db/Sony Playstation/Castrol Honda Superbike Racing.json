{"altername_name": ["SuperLite 1500 Series: Castrol Honda Super Bike Racing"], "name": "Castrol Honda Superbike Racing", "overview": "Castrol Honda Superbike Racing is a simulation-style racing game featuring the Honda RVF-RC45 motorbike and 14 real-world venues. Adjust your bike's gear-ratio settings, transmission, and tire composition before competing against seven computer-controlled riders in either a single race or a 13-event tournament. Individual practice and training sessions allow you to learn each track's layout and optimal racing lines prior to the event. View the action from a first-person perspective behind the bike's handlebars or from a third-person vantage point. Six difficulty levels and various other customization settings let you determine the degree of realism on each course. You can also challenge a friend to a head-to-head race via split-screen display.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "July 20, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Interactive Entertainment", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.18", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MuBhD07Cls", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/8934-castrol-honda-superbike-racing\n"}
