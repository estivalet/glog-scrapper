{"altername_name": ["Blue Breaker Burst: Hohoemi wo Anata to", "Blue Breaker Burst: Hohoemi o Anata to"], "name": "Blue Breaker Burst: Bishou o Anata to", "overview": "Chimena wishes to rid herself and the world of the sinister Dragon Lord, and to do so, she will travel to various areas gathering clues and meeting with other familiar and unfamiliar Blue Breaker characters. Blue Breaker Burst is a mostly girl-centric fighter and the story deals with different girls who will eventually fall in love with Kein, the hero from the RPG. However, a new girl has been added to the love circle and her name is Chimena. Chimena wishes to rid herself and the world of the sinister Dragon Lord, and to do so, she will travel to various areas gathering clues and meeting with other familiar (or not) Blue Breaker characters. In order to know all of the story, you will have to buy that too. The sequel elaborates more on Chimena's story. You have a story mode which allows you to select a \"bride\" to work their way to battle the legendary sword \"Seiken\" (excluding Chimena). The story mode had a very interesting concept (at least Chimena's quest) that combined RPG and fighting game elements. In Chimena's quest and hers alone, you can travel to the different parts of the world (from the BB RPG) and gather information and sleep at inns to restore your HP when you get wounded. Occasionally, as you walk around, you will fight Mamono (a generic ogre/goblin) and you must make important decisions. You can avoid fighting if you pick the right decisions.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "July 23, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "HuneX", "publishers": "Human", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/33421-blue-breaker-burst-bishou-o-anata-to\n"}
