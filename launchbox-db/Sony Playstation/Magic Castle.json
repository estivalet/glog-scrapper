The game\u2019s UI can be adjusted around the screen to suit the player\u2019s liking. Players need to be mindful as they navigate the 2D floors, since enemies can actually follow them from room to room. Additionally, although it is not fully-functional, a four-player multi-tap controller component was built into the game to allow players to adventure through the castle together, with items able to be shared amongst the team at will.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "December 23, 2020", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "", "developers": "KAIGA", "publishers": "", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.7", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/9PhHFm9kjuc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147225-magic-castle\n"}
