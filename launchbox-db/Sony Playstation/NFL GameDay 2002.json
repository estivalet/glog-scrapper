As usual, this year's edition of the game is fully licensed by the NFL and features teams and rosters accurate to the most recent (2000-2001) season. The game features a newly sophisticated AI system, designed to pick up on patterns in the gamer's play calling and adjust appropriately, emphasizing a need for strategic variety. Additional player moves add to the realism, incorporating pushes, shoves, and new blocks. Graphics have also been updated to present more realistic, recognizable players on the virtual gridiron. Dick Enberg returns with new play-by-play and color commentary is provided by Dan Fouts. This year's cover features Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb, who was motion-captured for the game and also consulted designers on gameplay. McNabb's talent, skill, and competitive spirit are said to reflect Sony's ideals for this edition in the GameDay series.
