{"altername_name": [], "name": "Afraid Gear", "overview": "Afraid Gear is a strategy/simulation game by Asmik Ace, the game got a sequel called Afraid Gear Another that was also released for the Playstation One console. The premise of the game is that the player builds a mecha and fight in tournaments against other mecha in order to win money. With his winnings, he may purchase better parts and weapons so that you can destroy more difficult opponents. It sounds a bit like Armored Core, but there are many differences that separate the two. First, the battle system is almost totally automatic. If you decide to switch over to manual mode, you get a limited number of choices. You can choose which weapons to fire, what power level to go to, and what part of your opponent's mecha to aim for. Leaving it on auto-pilot is easier, since the AI is fairly good. As for your opponents, they're either dumb as rocks or very smart. It depends on what level you're fighting at.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "October 29, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Office Create", "publishers": "Asmik Ace Entertainment", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106916-afraid-gear\n"}
