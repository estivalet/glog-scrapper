Both machines contain 42 songs, including the 13 from Club Version. Club Version 2 allows DDR players to change the step pattern difficulty before each song, between Basic, Another, and Maniac (or just Basic and Another for Doubles mode). Song selection can be done on either machine, but the game now ends if any one of the players fails the song. Club Version 2 also introduces the Catastrophic level of difficulty for 9-foot songs. Later in 1999, Dance Dance Revolution 2ndReMix Append Club Version Vol.1 and Dance Dance Revolution 2ndReMix Append Club Version Vol.2 were released in Japan for the PlayStation.
