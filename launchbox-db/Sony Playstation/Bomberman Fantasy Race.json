{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bomberman Fantasy Race", "overview": "The man with the big bombs is blowing up a completely different type of game in this strange and whimsical racing game. It sure isn't like your typical racer -- Bomberman Fantasy Race has players riding on big loping kangaroos and giant blue rabbitty-dinos as they hop and dash to the finish line with long, bounding gaits. It's a wild race, made even wilder with all the bombs and action of Bomberman. Two can challenge each other to a blast around the track, or run for it on your own in the single-player mode. Buy new bombs and better ride-a-long animals to give the competition something to blow its top over!", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "March 31, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Graphic Research", "publishers": "Hudson Soft", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.33", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomberman_Fantasy_Race", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/3969-bomberman-fantasy-race\n"}
