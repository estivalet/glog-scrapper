{"altername_name": ["Buggy"], "name": "Team Losi RC Racer", "overview": "Team Losi RC Racer is a one or two-player racing game that features 16 radio-controlled vehicles. You'll be racing against various opponents to unlock new tracks (15 in all), discover new cars and conquer the vast hub system that connects every track together. Discovering new tracks and bonus goodies involves locating any given rainbow-colored gate; after you're familiar with the tracks, you can perfect your times and utilize the gates to your advantage. Of course, you're not required to race every single time you play -- you can explore the tracks for said gates, finding shortcuts that will give you an advantage over the opposition. Radio-controlled vehicles are based on performance ratings including speed, acceleration, grip and weight. There are four cars to choose from at the start of the game; whereas Krush is average in all areas, the Flame Dragon has incredible handling and acceleration features. Tracks incorporate surreal environments such as beachside raceways, mountainous terrain and a desert.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "October 1, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Gremlin Interactive", "publishers": "Fox Interactive", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.88", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/13108-team-losi-rc-racer\n"}
