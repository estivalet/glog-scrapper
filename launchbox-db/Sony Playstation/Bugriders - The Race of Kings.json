{"altername_name": ["Bug Riders: The Race of Kings"], "name": "Bugriders: The Race of Kings", "overview": "The King of Entymion, Leptus, is about to die. Rather than hold elections or keep the tradition of primogeniture, the next king will be chosen with a race. Not just any race, but a race in which the participants ride on giant bugs. Choose from 22 different contestants, each with unique racing styles and weapon, and try to be the first to the finish line on six tracks. If finishing first is a little too tough, make your bug go faster by using your riding crop. But be careful, or your bug will quit running for you. For those looking for a less-than-honest way to win, collect power-ups and weapons scattered throughout the track to blow past your opponents or blast them out of the sky. And don't forget to keep your eyes open for the shortcuts in each track. Do you have the nerve and the skill to win the Great Race?
