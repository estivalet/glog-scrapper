{"altername_name": ["Zen-Nippon Pro Wrestling: Ouja no Kon", "Zen Nihon Pro Wrestling: Ouja no Tamashii"], "name": "Zen-Nippon Pro Wrestling: Soul of Champions", "overview": "Zen-Nippon Pro Wrestling: Ouja no Kon is a 3D Japanese wrestling game released in 1999 for the PlayStation. It was published by Human Entertainment (and later Spike) and developed by Human Club. One of the main game features is the Powerball system. This system provides each wrestler with two to four Powerballs that can be used in a match in several different ways. Powerballs allow each wrestler to use a special move that is specifically assigned to them, they can be used to give regular moves extra power, or they can be used to kick out of a pin attempt when your wrestler would not normally have the strength to do so. The game features 25 wrestlers (including one hidden wrestler) from the All Japan Pro Wrestling promotion. There are seven modes of play available in the game: One Night Match, Champion Carnival, Real World Tag League, Battle Royal, Create Edit (Create-a-Wrestler), MVP Season Mode, and Defend Title (hidden mode).", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "April 8, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Human Club", "publishers": "Human Entertainment", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.38", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/32044-zen-nippon-pro-wrestling-soul-of-champions\n"}
