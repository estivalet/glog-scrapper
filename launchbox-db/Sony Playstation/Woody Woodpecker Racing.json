{"altername_name": ["Woody Woodpecker no Go! Go! Racing"], "name": "Woody Woodpecker Racing", "overview": "Straight from the classic cartoon series comes Woody Woodpecker and his friends in a kart racing adventure. Join Chilly Willy, Buzz Buzzard, and, of course, Woody himself as you race over 15 different tracks from such locales as Brazil, Italy and Japan. With four different types of vehicles and six different drivers (plus three hidden characters), you will not be at a loss of choices as you race in a wild and wacky manner that's to be expected from Walter Lantz's characters. With outlandish power-ups, including splatting tomatoes and homing pigeons, you are sure to be kept on your toes as you battle for first place.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "November 16, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Syrox Developments", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.41", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zZI9vdss-4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/11224-woody-woodpecker-racing\n"}
