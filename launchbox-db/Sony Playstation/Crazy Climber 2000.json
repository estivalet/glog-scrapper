{"altername_name": [], "name": "Crazy Climber 2000", "overview": "PS appeared in Action \"Crazy Climber\" which was a big hit in the arcade will twist. Reproduced by operation of twin stick arcade version will use the analog stick of the controller. I'm with the 2 mode version of the 3D graphics freely and enjoy the thrill of climbing to the original arcade version, the 3-dimensional buildings. A 3-D update of Nichibutsu's arcade classic, Crazy Climber 2000 takes the game play of the original and gives it a sweeping graphical makeover. Players control a man attempting to scale a series of skyscrapers with nothing more than his hands and feet. The building's tenants and a circling vulture will hurl various items at you, while a gorilla occasionally attempts to reach out and grab you. All of these obstacles must be avoided, along with the more routine danger of windows closing on your fingers. The game's buildings start out as square skyscrapers, but later levels introduce round buildings and new threats, such as homicidal window cleaners and falling rocks, to keep the climber from making it to the top. This new version also offers the player the ability to move from one face of a building to another. Included is the original Crazy Climber in all of its early 80s glory, and unlike the version included with Nichibutsu's previous arcade compilation, this one allows the use of the Playstation's dual shock analog sticks.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "February 3, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nichibutsu", "publishers": "Nihon Bussan", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/92045-crazy-climber-2000\n"}
