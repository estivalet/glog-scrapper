{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gundam: The Battle Master", "overview": "Gundam: the Battle Master is a Japanese fighting game involving robots who will try to attack and destroy each other. Before you start the game, you can choose from a various amount of robots, each being smaller or bigger, or having different attacks. As you progress the game, your opponents will get more difficult to beat. During a fight, your temperature bar will decrease when you manage not to get hit by your opponent. All the robots will start with 4 levels of armor. As you attack your opponent with missiles and bazookas, his temperature bar will increase. You can aim your long range weapons by holding them to the direction you wish to shoot at. The game will be over when one of the robot's armors are fully destroyed or when time limit reaches zero and one robot has more armor than its opponent. Special moves requires energy from the energy cap, which is shown right below the temperature bar. Your opponent will be beaten when he is overheated. When both robots are at the same level of armor, then the current temperature will decide the winner. You can block attacks in the air when you jump, but you cannot block when you are dashing.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "June 20, 1997", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Natsume", "publishers": "Bandai", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.88", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/33419-gundam-the-battle-master\n"}
