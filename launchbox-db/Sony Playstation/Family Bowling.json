{"altername_name": ["Wai Wai Bowling"], "name": "Family Bowling", "overview": "Family Bowling (also known as Wai Wai Bowling in a later release) is a bowling game that features 2 courts at the beginning of the game (Prism Town & Liberty Planet), 12 characters (only 4 are available at the beginning of the game) & 2 game modes: - Free or Tournament mode: In this mode there are 4 possible playable characters to choose (Maki, Kazuhiko, Shota & Ichika). The player can select also the number of opponents and if he wants that they will be computer or player opponents. - Challenge Mode: In this mode the characters are the same as in free mode but here the gameplay is about different bowling challenges that the player has to try to clear. The gameplay as usual in the bowling games begins with an overview of the court where the player has to select the direction of the shot, after that the character direction and finally select the power and effect of the shot. At the beginning the player can change the name of the bowler and also select if he want a right-hand or lefty player. The game allows up to four human players (using the same controller, not a multitap) to play at the same game.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "August 6, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Nihon Bussan", "publishers": "Nichibutsu (Nihon Bussan)", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLyuQtZKy-o", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/95687-family-bowling\n"}
