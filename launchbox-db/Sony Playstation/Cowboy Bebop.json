{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cowboy Bebop", "overview": "The game is a scrolling shooter which bears striking similarities to Star Fox for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (Super Famicom). The player controls Spike Spiegel's Swordfish II from a third person perspective. Each level involves chasing another ship (the bounty head) along a set track through different environments, while enemies attack. Each stage ends with a boss battle. Between stages, bonus points earned can be spent to purchase upgrades for the ship. These upgrades include faster speed, more powerful ammo, and better defensive shields.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "May 14, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bandai", "publishers": "Bandai", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy_Bebop_(PlayStation_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/85861-cowboy-bebop\n"}
