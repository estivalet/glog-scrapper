{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dungeon Shoutenkai: Densetsu no Ken Hajimemashita", "overview": "Dungeon Shoutenkai: Densetsu no Ken Hajimemashita is a simulation RPG game in which the player takes the role of a novice witch that is the owner of a shop in a little town. She also has a cat that helps her. In the game she will have to trade (selling and buying different kind of things) and she'll meet other characters (warriors, magician, adventures, thiefs, etc) and with some of them she will go in adventures in the dungeon that is on the town. The gameplay is mostly just choosing what to buy or sell or what answer to give, when she encounters someone in the town. The game uses a first person perspective with beautiful and detailed 2D cartoon graphics. When the Witch assembles a party of adventures, she can enter a dungeon and there the game changes to a third person perspective with a overview of the dungeon. When the witch encounters an enemy the game changes again to a first person perspective in which the player can choose what each of his characters will do (attack, defense, use item or magic, etc). The battles are turn based.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "October 29, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kinotrope", "publishers": "Kodansha", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/104532-dungeon-shoutenkai-densetsu-no-ken-hajimemashita\n"}
