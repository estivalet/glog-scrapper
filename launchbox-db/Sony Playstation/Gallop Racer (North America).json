{"altername_name": ["Gallop Racer 3", "Gallop Racer 3"], "name": "Gallop Racer (North America)", "overview": "Just like in real horse racing, no two races are alike: race outcomes are determined by racetrack, conditions, pack and luck. A great party game for players and spectators alike, you can be the jockey, or select watch mode, and be a spectator. As the jockey, you decide when to hold back, move inside, move outside and go for the lead horses even change lanes, get bumped, get blocked and lose ground on curves. The winners are put out to stud, and the losers, put out to pasture. Gallop Racer (originally released as 'Gallop Racer 3: One and Only Road to Victory' in Japan) is the third game in the Gallop Racer series, and features 1400+ horses, 28 racetracks, and many secrets to be unlocked. Three modes of play in which players can become a jockey or a spectator are included: Season, Practice, and Versus. Season mode will keep players busy for a long time with its realistic level of play, large number of horses, and the ability to breed. Versus mode pits players against each other in a series of three or five races.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "March 18, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tecmo", "publishers": "Tecmo", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.17", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallop_Racer", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KENfOsJ4jQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/110377-gallop-racer-north-america\n"}
