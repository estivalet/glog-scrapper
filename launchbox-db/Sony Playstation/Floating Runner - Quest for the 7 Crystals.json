{"altername_name": ["Floating Runner - 7-tsu no Suishou no Monogatari"], "name": "Floating Runner: Quest for the 7 Crystals", "overview": "The villainous Zaurer has usurped control of the floating lands and at his behest, vile creatures have overrun the seven worlds, terrorizing the inhabitants and generally running amok. As the bounty hunter Lay or the young priestess Cress, players must venture across the lands en route to a final showdown with the evil force behind the chaos. Floating Runner: Quest for the 7 Crystals is a 3D platform adventure consisting of fourteen levels across seven different themed environments, with classic locales ranging from tropical forests to frozen tundra. As in the Mega Man series of titles, players can choose which of the worlds to attempt in whatever order they so desire. Populating each world are enemies in the guise of cute animals that can be dispatched using power-ups and weapons found scattered throughout the area. While avoiding the treacherous chasms and gaps that permeate the floating worlds, players will need to seek out special gems while keeping an eye on the time remaining to complete each world. Continues are unlimited so failure is little more than a temporary hindrance.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "January 1, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Kokopeli Digital Studios", "publishers": "THQ", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/12567-floating-runner-quest-for-the-7-crystals\n"}
