{"altername_name": [], "name": "Spec Ops: Ranger Elite", "overview": "Spec Ops: Ranger Elite is a tactical shooter with an emphasis on strategy. As in earlier releases in the Spec Ops series, the player takes control of two operatives from a small group of highly trained Army Rangers in this next title from Runecraft and Take 2. Each member of the group has a specialty so choosing the right duo for a given mission is an important factor of success. The action takes place in 3D-rendered environments as the player guides the characters from a third-person perspective. In the single-player version of the game, the player takes the role of one soldier while the computer guides the other.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "May 2, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Runecraft", "publishers": "Take-Two Interactive", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/13137-spec-ops-ranger-elite\n"}
