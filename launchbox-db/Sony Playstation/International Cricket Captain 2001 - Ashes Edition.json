{"altername_name": [], "name": "International Cricket Captain 2001: Ashes Edition", "overview": "International Cricket Captain, also known as ICC for short, is a series of cricket management video games by Empire Interactive, and then by Childish Things since International Cricket Captain 2009, before which Empire went into administration. It rose to popularity in 1998, following the release of the first PC-based game in the series. The most recent version of the game is International Cricket Captain 2016. The concept for International Cricket Captain was the brainchild of Chris Child, who programmed the original game engine as a university project. The player takes control of an English County Cricket squad with the aim of leading them to success in the domestic competition and ultimately being asked to take up the position of England manager. There is also an added option in later games in the ICC series to take control of one of the other Test playing nations. Taking inspiration from the hugely successful Championship Manager series of games, most aspects of a management sim are present in ICC, with the ability to coach players on their individual skills, scout opposition and buy and sell players at the end of each season. There are also comprehensive statistics available in the form of career stats pages for each player and team. Graphs and charts help the gamer to select the strongest team possible against particular opposition.[1]", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "August 24, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Empire Interactive", "publishers": "Empire Interactive Entertainment", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.88", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78946-international-cricket-captain-2001-ashes-edition\n"}
