{"altername_name": [], "name": "Summon Night", "overview": "Summon Night is the first video game in the Summon Night series. It was released for the Playstation and later ported to the Nintendo DS, however it has never been officially brought to North America. All of the Summon Night games takes place in Lyndbaum, a world similar to medieval Europe with the inclusion of modern factories and railroads, placing Summon Nights in a steampunk setting. Lyndbaum is surrounded by four other worlds: Loreilal, the land where mechanical creatures hail from; Silturn, the land of Onis; Sapureth, where angels and demons come from; and Maetropa. where half-humans, magical beasts, fairies and other mythical creatures hail. Besides those four there are also countless other worlds, including our world (the \"real\" world) where the main characters of the first game are transported from. Certain boundaries separate the worlds from each other, making the various summoning techniques the only way to transport things between them. In the S-RPG, players take control of a student named Touya (three other protagonists are possible) who has been spirited to a world known as Lyndbaum. Once there, he joins up with a ragtag crew and eventually goes on an adventure to save the world.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "June 1, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Flight-Plan", "publishers": "Banpresto", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/93353-summon-night\n"}
