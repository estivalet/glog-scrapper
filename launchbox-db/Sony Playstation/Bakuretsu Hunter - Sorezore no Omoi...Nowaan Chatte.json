Seven years ago, an entire village mysteriously vanished during a festival; now, that same village has just as mysteriously reappeared.

Bakuretsu Hunter: Sorezore no Omoi...Nowaan Chatte is an adventure game based on the Bakuretsu Hunter anime, featuring a new unique scenario not based on any story from the TV show or comic.
