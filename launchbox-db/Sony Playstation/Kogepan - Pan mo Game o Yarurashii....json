The character is a burnt red bean bread bun who lives in a panya (Japanese bakery), trying to fit in and make friends with the other bread items. The name comes from kogeru, meaning to burn or char, and pan, a gairaigo word taken from Portuguese and meaning bread. There are a number of other characters (breads) in the panya with Kogepan, including ichigopan (strawberry bread), kireipan (beautiful bread), kuriimupan (a burnt cream bread), and Sumipan, a bread even more burnt than Kogepan. Other Characters: - Kuriimupan (creamy bread) is also a burnt bread like me. We are very good friends and we always drink beer (milk) together and often run away from home. - Kireipan, as known as the pretty breads. They are delicious and unlike me, they are not burnt. I am always jealous of them. - Sumipan is even more burnt than me. He is called the charcoal bread and he is also my very good friend. - Ichigopan is the latest addition to the family. He is the strawberry cream bread and unlike the other bread, he is pink in color.
