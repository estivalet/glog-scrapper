{"altername_name": [], "name": "Janhai Yuugi '99: Tanuki no Kawazanyou", "overview": "Janhai Yuugi '99 - Tanuki no Kawazanyou is a 2d mahjong game in which the player takes the role of a man that wants to become the king of mahjong in his city, one day he finds a lost wallet that takes him to a mahjong school when he will start his journey to earn lots of money and become the city's mahjong champion. Mahjong is a game that originated in China, commonly played by four players (with some three-player variations found in Korea and Japan). Mahjong is a game of skill, strategy and calculation and involves a certain degree of chance. In Asia, mahjong is also popularly played as a gambling game (though it may just as easily be played recreationally). The game is played with a set of 152 tiles based on Chinese characters and symbols, although some regional variations use a different number of tiles. In most variations, each player begins by receiving thirteen tiles. In turn players draw and discard tiles until they complete a legal hand using the fourteenth drawn tile to form four groups (melds) and a pair (head). There are fairly standard rules about how a piece is drawn, stolen from another player (melded), the use of basic (numbered tiles) and honours (winds and dragons), the kinds of melds, and the order of dealing and play. However there are many regional variations which may vary these rules; in addition, the scoring system, the minimum hand necessary to win varies significantly based on the local rules being used.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "December 17, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Warashi", "publishers": "Media Rings", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/110413-janhai-yuugi-99-tanuki-no-kawazanyou\n"}
