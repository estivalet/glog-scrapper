{"altername_name": ["Bomberman", "Bomberman"], "name": "Bomberman Party Edition", "overview": "Bomberman returns to PlayStation for a bargain hurrah with Bomberman: Party Edition. This version of the seminal multiplayer game keeps it simple and classic. The game features 2D backdrops, bombs, players, and that's about it. Grab this game, a multi-tap, and some friends, and bomb away like the halcyon days of yore. You'll travel through the familiar grid-like levels, nabbing power-ups as you try and obliterate the competition.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "December 10, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Metro", "publishers": "Hudson", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "5", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.46", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomberman_Party_Edition", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/nvVHQ_u1oaM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/9057-bomberman-party-edition\n"}
