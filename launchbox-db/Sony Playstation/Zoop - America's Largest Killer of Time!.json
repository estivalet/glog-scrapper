{"altername_name": ["Zoop"], "name": "Zoop: America's Largest Killer of Time!", "overview": "Zoop is a puzzle game that introduces some new concepts to the puzzle genre. You must take control of a little tool that shoots out different colored blocks at blocks that litter the screen. If you can fire a block into another of the same color, they will disappear, thus helping to clear the area. Once every block is gone, the level is over. If you fire a block into another of a different color, it will pile up and you will have to shoot at it again. The graphics in puzzle games are never very complex, and this game is no exception. Every item is represented in a bright manner through sprites, so the gameplay and speed remain constant. Zoop is a classic, addictive puzzle game with a few new twists that help to separate it from similar titles.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "October 31, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Hookstone Productions", "publishers": "Viacom New Media", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.66", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoop", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/11198-zoop-americas-largest-killer-of-time\n"}
