{"altername_name": ["Asterix: Mega Madness", "Asterix: Maximum Gaudium"], "name": "Ast\u00e9rix: Mega Madness", "overview": "The year is 50 B.C.. In the sole, well-known Gaulish village that stands against the Roman oppressors, Chief Vitalstatistix announces a contest to find out who is the bravest, boldest, and strongest Gaul. The volunteers for the contest are Ast\u00e9rix, Ob\u00e9lix, Cacofonix and Mrs. Geriatrix, who compete in a series of different mini-games, split in four days. These range from shooting various objects (and unfortunate pirates and Romans) at a marching Roman army, gathering ingredients for Getafix, eating fast at a feast table while avoiding rotten food items, hunting wild boars, racing with catapults, racing while carrying another Gaul on a shield, demolishing a Roman camp and more. Players can engage in practice mode (play each activity individually), Mega Madness mode (campaign mode with connected activities and cumulative ranking), and team play. Each mini-game can be played by one or two human players.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "June 29, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "UDS", "publishers": "Infogrames", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.35", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterix:_Mega_Madness", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFXFX6oeryI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/32469-asterix-mega-madness\n"}
