{"altername_name": [], "name": "MaxRacer", "overview": "MaxRacer is a futuristic racing game similar to Wipeout. There are three courses and five different racers, each with their own abilities. The game runs on an arcade-style checkpoint system, ending the race if you don't reach each checkpoint quickly enough, and also gives each racer a shield meter to discourage hitting the walls. The game is only one-player, but best times can be saved with a memory card.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "April 18, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Avion", "publishers": "", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/96211-maxracer\n"}
