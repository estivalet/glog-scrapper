{"altername_name": ["Koukai Sarena Katta Shuki: The Note"], "name": "The Note", "overview": "Linda, Toshi and Dave, three members of an occult group of a senior high school end up missing while investigating a mansion in a town in southern Europe. Linda, one of the group sent her mother photos of spirits she captured inside the mansion before she disappeared. You are Akira, a freelance journalist. Linda's mother hired you and your assistant Angela to find the whereabouts of her daughter and the two other kids she was with. The Note is an action adventure survival horror title, you move around the levels in a first person view and can interact with almost everything in the rooms. Curtains can be opened, fireplaces can be lit (granted, if you have any wood) and items such as paintings can be examined for additional info. The game allows binding functions such as Check, Open or item-based functions such as Shotgun or Match to the shoulder-buttons, so you can use doors and weapons without going through the menu every single time. In the general fashion of survival horror games, you must lit torches or open curtains in order to access dark corners, ie. to use a key to a nearby door or to examine a painting closely. You must also conserve your ammunition since nightly creatures such as rats, bats, werewolves and zombies roam the levels. You can exit the levels and visit the city where you can buy and sell supplies, rest or save your game. These parts work much like menu based role playing games.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "January 17, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "NK System", "publishers": "On Demand", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.78", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/34211-the-note\n"}
