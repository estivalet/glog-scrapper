He had been hired to aid the war fought by the country, which will last throughout the following three years of the game, where the player will meet a number of the different characters and develop a relationship with them. The sequel to the dating simulation Mitsumete Knight, called Mitsumete Knight R - Daibouken Hen features a 2d isometric view RPG game, this sequel features some characters of the first game. The story in this case changes and the player controls one of the kingdom's knights (called Christopher McCloud) that will join a group of 5 girls and starts a quest to find the cure for the king disease. The player can customize the armors and dresses of the girls in his party and there are a lot of different combinations (of shields, weapons, rings, dresses, etc.) and the girls can be viewed at full screen with the current equipment. One of the most interesting features of the game is that when the player and his party go to the map and have to travel to different places that game uses a 3d view that shows the 2 girls talking to the main character and the player can choose between different answers.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "November 26, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/93837-mitsumete-knight-r-daibouken-hen\n"}
