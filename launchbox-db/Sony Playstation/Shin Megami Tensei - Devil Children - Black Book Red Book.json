{"altername_name": ["Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Children: Kuro no Sho, Aka no Sho"], "name": "Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Children: Black Book/Red Book", "overview": "Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Children Black Book and Red Book on the PlayStation are remakes of the Gameboy versions. Red Book and Black Book are two completely different games, featuring two different stories with different protagonists, but an intertwining world. Devil Children's main characters are part human and part demon. They're known as \"Devil Children\". The game takes place in modern Japan and the realm of Makai. The children travel around with weapons and a monster and was largely compared to Pokemon when the game released. The part human, part demon character would never fight in battles. Instead, their companion monster would go into battle and duel for them, with a limit of two out at once.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "March 28, 2002", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Access", "publishers": "Atlus", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.88", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/64005-shin-megami-tensei-devil-children-black-bookred-book\n"}
