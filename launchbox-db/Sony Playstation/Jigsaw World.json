{"altername_name": [], "name": "Jigsaw World", "overview": "Jigsaw World is a jigsaw puzzle game, and the sequel to Jigsaw Party. Much like its predecessor, it combines the jigsaw puzzle with elements of arcade puzzle games, tasking two players (or a player and the computer) with solving a set of puzzles as quickly as possible. Pieces are supplied to each player in a specific order, and there are also power-ups that can be used to hinder the other player. The main attraction is the Alice in Jigsaw Land story mode, a parody of Lewis Carrol's famous novel, in which the player controls Alice as she competes against a variety of characters in jigsaw puzzle battles. In addition to the battle modes, there is also a regular puzzle mode for one player. There are over 100 puzzles, including both photographs and illustrations, each of which can be played as either a 24, 96, or 150 piece puzzle.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "February 3, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nippon Ichi Software", "publishers": "Nippon Ichi Software", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "0.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeKnj84YWfM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/156586-jigsaw-world\n"}
