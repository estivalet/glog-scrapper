{"altername_name": [], "name": "Wanted", "overview": "Wanted is a game released by Phoenix as a cheap title for the Playstation one console and the gameplay is similar to arcade games Blood Bross or Cabal (but without the 2 players mode), in the part that the character is viewed from behind and the player has to defeat all the enemies in each level to advance to the next one. In the game the player takes the role of the sheriff of a town in the wild west age and you have to shoot the enemies until reaching the number requird to end the level. An enemy gauge at the bottom of the screen decreased as foes are killed. The bad parts of the game is that looks more like a demo than to a complete game due to the lack of music and 'cause that the player doesn't have a good control method since he can hide from the enemy bullets or roll to avoid them.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "February 16, 2004", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "NAPS Team", "publishers": "Phoenix Games", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78963-wanted\n"}
