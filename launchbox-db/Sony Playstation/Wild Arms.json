Until one ill-fated day when the evil race of Metal Demons brutally invaded peaceful Filgaia. The war stripped the Guardians of all their power and left the land in ruins. Only a devastated wasteland remained. But now, three warriors filled with faith and courage hear the call of the Guardians so they can bring back the peace that once permeated this barren land. Join Rudy, Cecilia, and Jack as they plunge into the wasteland to find the ancient relics that may save this desperate world in an epic journey that will take you to the end of the wilderness.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "May 10, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Contrail", "publishers": "Sony", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.12", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Arms_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTCpWvNLEY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/9079-wild-arms\n"}
