{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Three Stooges", "overview": "Cinemaware's classic title, The Three Stooges, makes its PlayStation debut as a collection of mini-games starring the famed comedy trio. Moe, Larry, and Curly are pressed into action when a cantankerous banker named I. Fleecem demands the mortgage be paid at Ma's Orphanage. She needs 5000 dollars in 30 days to save the business or else the children will be left homeless. Each day represents one activity, which is selected by stopping Moe's hand as it moves across a series of colored spaces. If the hand lands on a mousetrap space, a finger is snapped and a day is lost. Four snapped fingers means the game is over. Other spaces include Banker, which means the Stooges spend the day losing ten percent of their cash or receiving a nasty comment; Money, which offers a random amount of cash; and Question Mark, which could result in either a windfall of money or a visit from I. Fleecem. The majority of spaces are jobs in the form of mini-games. Curly tries to scoop up as many crackers as possible with a spoon, the Stooges race across a hospital in tiny racecars, Larry runs across a sidewalk to find a song before Curly loses a boxing match, and the trio, dressed as waiters, sling pies at their guests as quickly as possible. Completing each job brings the Stooges a step closer to their 5000 dollars goal, with surprises waiting for them if they manage to reach certain milestones. Progress during the adventure can be saved to memory card at the end of each day.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "February 7, 2004", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Cinemaware", "publishers": "Metro3D", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.62", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/13085-the-three-stooges\n"}
