{"altername_name": ["Tenchu - Shinobi Hyakusen"], "name": "Rittai Ninja Katsugeki Tenchu: Shinobi Hyakusen", "overview": "Tenchu: Shinobi Hyakusen is an expansion pack for Tenchu. It was released on November 11, 1999 for the PlayStation. It is a standalone expansion, meaning it does not require the disc for the main game. The game is based on the levels created by the users of Shinobi Gaisen. Acquire held a competition for these levels, and the best one hundred missions were collected, and ultimately formed Tenchu: Shinobi Hyakusen. There are also secret missions to unlock. The whole game consists of 122 missions. The theme of each mission focuses on a chosen objective. Some missions emphasise elimination, while others focus on assassination, finding a peculiar flower or protecting Princess Kiku along the way. The game fundamentals and controls remained unchanged. However, missions in Shinobi Hyakusen are not bound together by any storyline. Playing through the missions earns the player FMV and other promotional videos, beta test captures, artwork and other behind-the-scenes material otherwise not accessible.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "November 11, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Acquire", "publishers": "Sony", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/112174-rittai-ninja-katsugeki-tenchu-shinobi-hyakusen\n"}
