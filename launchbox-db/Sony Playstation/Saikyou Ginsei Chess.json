{"altername_name": [], "name": "Saikyou Ginsei Chess", "overview": "Saikyou Ginsei Chess is a digital recreation of the chess board game of the same title with different difficulty levels. Each player begins the game with sixteen pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns, each of these types of pieces moving differently. Pieces are used to attack and capture the opponent's pieces. The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent's king by placing it under threat of capture (\"check\") which cannot be avoided. In addition to checkmate, the game can be won by the voluntary resignation of one's opponent, which may occur when too much material is lost, or if checkmate appears unavoidable. A game may result in a draw in several ways, and neither player wins. The course of the game is divided in three phases. The beginning of the game is called the opening (with the development of pieces). The opening yields to the phase called the middlegame. The last phase is the endgame, generally characterised by the disappearance of queens.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "December 24, 2002", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.62", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/135975-saikyou-ginsei-chess\n"}
