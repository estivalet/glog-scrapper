{"altername_name": ["Rise of the Robots 2: Resurrection"], "name": "Rise 2: Resurrection", "overview": "Rise 2 Resurrection for the Sony PlayStation, the sequel to Rise of the Robots, improves upon the original game's positive aspects and fixes some of its problems. Once again the music is written and performed by former Queen band member Brian May, and once again it rocks hard, this time with the benefit of CD technology. The graphics are an improvement over its handsome predecessor, and the sound effects are vibrant and explosive. While these aesthetic improvements are to be expected, the things that are the same in Rise 2 Resurrection from the first Rise of the Robots is the gameplay. There are 18 different darkly futuristic fighters, a slew of combos, several gruesome termination moves, and plenty of combat techniques. It's certainly not very original, but it is fun. The controls are responsive, and the fights are furious and thoroughly convincing. When you pull off a multiple-hit combo and robotic metal clangs against robotic metal, it's enough to make your teeth rattle.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "March 6, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Mirage", "publishers": "Acclaim Entertainment", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.62", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rise_2:_Resurrection", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/11368-rise-2-resurrection\n"}
