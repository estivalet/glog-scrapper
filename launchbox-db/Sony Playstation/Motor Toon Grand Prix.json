The game takes racing into furistic warped world of cartoon images and bright lights, with such locations as haunted castles, glass roads, volcanoes, and other cartoony locations. Motor Toon GP2 features more than ten tracks and eight racers each with different skills and abilities. Unlike many of other titles of cute and childish nature, Motor Toon GP2 is not for the faint hearted and includes five difficulties levels. Motor Toon Grand Prix 2 also takes advantage of Sony's link up feature and a second disc link up copy of the game was included in the original Japanese release. It was released in the United States as simply 'Motor Toon Grand Prix', since its predecessor never left Japan, although the European version kept the Japanese title for unknown reasons. It was also known in Japan as 'Motor Toon Grand Prix: USA Edition' when re-released under the 'PlayStation the Best' greatest hits brand in 1997.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "May 24, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Sony Computer Entertainment", "publishers": "Sony Computer Entertainment", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.44", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_Toon_Grand_Prix_2", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2R_td1AlTU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/11121-motor-toon-grand-prix\n"}
