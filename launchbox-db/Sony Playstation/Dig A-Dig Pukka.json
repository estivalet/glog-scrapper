They are usually kept for companionship or enjoyment. People may keep a digital pet in lieu of a real pet. Digital pets can be \"simulations of real animals, as in the Petz series\" or \"fantasy ones like the Tamagotchi\". Unlike biological simulations, the pet does not usually reproduce. They generally do not die. In Dig a-Dig Pukka (Kokohore! Pukka: Dig a-Dig Pukka) the player controls a miner robotic pet that will explore the lands searching for rare minerals and gems. In his jobs he will be rewarded by his founds with money that the player can use to buy new objects and tools. The pet can examine things, and he also need to rest, eat, etc. Different lands will be opened as the player advance in the game. In some parts of the game (for example when the player finds a big crate in a cave) the pet won't know what to do and the player will be given 4 choices: - Yes: The pet will do the default action (a wrong one usually) - No: Here the player can choose between different actions until he finds the proper one for that item). - Don't know: Here the game will provide a tip (in japanese of course). - Exit: The pet will leave the item.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "December 7, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sony", "publishers": "Sony", "genres": "Life Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109810-dig-a-dig-pukka\n"}
