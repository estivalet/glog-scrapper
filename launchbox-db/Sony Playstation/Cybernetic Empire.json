{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cybernetic Empire", "overview": "A mysterious ancient artifact called \"The Cube\" has been unearthed in northern Russia. However, this strange object has fallen into the hands of a terrorist group called \"Black Mask\", who wish to use its powers for their own gain. The elite counterterrorist force UNSK (United Nations Security Keeper) has been sent in to recover The Cube before things get worse. Cybernetic Empire is a 3rd-person sci-fi action game. Controlling UNSK operatives Max Brougham and Nina Lebedeva, the player must infiltrate Black Mask's secret high-tech compound deep in northern Russia to recover The Cube and neutralize any threats. Each character begins with a standard-issue pistol but can also find other weapons like machine guns, sniper rifles, and rocket launchers. The game's most unique element is the Wire Tractor system, which allows the player to swing around at high speeds via a magnetic wire that can attach to most any surface, a-la Bionic Commando. It is also possible to climb directly on walls for a limited time, as well as recover items and information from downed enemy combatants.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "August 5, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Wolf Team", "publishers": "Telenet Japan", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.73", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/92055-cybernetic-empire\n"}
