{"altername_name": ["Castlevania Chronicle: Akumajou Dracula"], "name": "Castlevania Chronicles", "overview": "The plot of Castlevania Chronicles is similar to that of the first Castlevania: in the end of the 17th century the dreadful vampire Dracula is resurrected after a century of slumber. The people in Transylvania flee in horror, but the brave Simon Belmont takes his Vampire Killer whip and ventures into the ominous castle to put an end to the Lord of Darkness. The similarities to the first installment of the series are also evident in the game's overall structure and basic gameplay, as well as in level design and usable items. Most of the weapons and items from the first game return, with more rare and hidden items making an appearance. Familiar stages have been re-designed, and many new stages are introduced as well.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "October 8, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "KCET", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.93", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castlevania_Chronicles", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVV6Ee0Vb4M&ab_channel=LevelGamingGround", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/10724-castlevania-chronicles\n"}
