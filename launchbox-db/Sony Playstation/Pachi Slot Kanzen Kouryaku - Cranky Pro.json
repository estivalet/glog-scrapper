{"altername_name": ["Pachi-Slot Kanzen Kouryaku - Cranky Pro"], "name": "Pachi Slot Kanzen Kouryaku: Cranky Pro", "overview": "Pachi Slot Kanzen Kouryaku - Cranky Pro is a pachi-slot (gambling machine) game that features 2 different gambling machines and different levels of zoom. The 2 machines are Contest Cranky & Cranky Condor. Are based on the arcade slot machine of the same name released by Universal in 1995. A slot machine (American English), fruit machine (British English), poker machine (Australian English) or simply slot (American English) is a casino gambling machine with three or more reels which spin when a button is pushed. Slot machines are also known as one-armed bandits because slot machines were originally operated by a lever on the side of the machine (the one arm) instead of a button on the front panel, and because of their ability to leave the gamer penniless. Many modern machines still have a legacy lever in addition to the button. Slot machines include a currency detector that validates the coin or money inserted to play. The machine pays off based on patterns of symbols visible on the front of the machine when it stops. Modern computer technology has resulted in many variations on the slot machine concept. Slot machines are the most popular gambling method in casinos and constitute about 70 percent of the average casino's income. It is estimated that thirty percent or more of the profits from gambling machines come from problem gamblers.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "October 2, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Syscom Entertainment", "publishers": "Syscom Entertainment", "genres": "Casino", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/111774-pachi-slot-kanzen-kouryaku-cranky-pro\n"}
