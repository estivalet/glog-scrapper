{"altername_name": [], "name": "Final Fantasy IV", "overview": "Final Fantasy IV, known in the US as Final Fantasy II, follows the exploits of Cecil, a Black Knight and former leader of the Red Wings who questions the orders of his king and is demoted because of this. From here, he embarks on a journey that will span worlds and decide the fate of the entire kingdom. Battles are turn-based, but introduced to the series is the Active Time Battle (ATB) concept, which forces players to be quick with their decision-making because, despite the turn-based nature of the title, enemies can attack at brief intervals. The player's party can consist of as many as five people at one time and throughout the adventure, characters will leave and join up with the party. The characters themselves are divided into classes and possess specific attributes and skills. Kain, for example, is able to use a jump ability in battle while Rosa wields white magic. Known as the \"Easytype,\" the original US release excluded particular items, abilities, and spells, all of which have been restored for this release, dubbed \"Hardtype.\" As part of the update, new FMV cutscenes are interjected throughout the game.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "June 29, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Square", "publishers": "Square", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.22", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/16871-final-fantasy-iv\n"}
