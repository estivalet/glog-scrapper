{"altername_name": ["Rockman 5: Blues no Wana!"], "name": "Rockman 5: Complete Works", "overview": "Mega Man 5, known as Rockman 5 Blues no Wana?! . \"Rockman 5 Blues' Trap?!\") in Japan, is a video game developed by Capcom for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). It is the fifth game in the original Mega Man series and was originally released in Japan on December 4, 1992. It saw a release during the same month in North America and in November 1993 in Europe. The plot takes place after the fourth defeat of the evil Dr. Wily at the hands of the heroic robot Mega Man in the year 20XX. Proto Man uncharacteristically leads a group of menacing robots in attacks on the world and kidnaps his own creator Dr. Light, leaving Mega Man little choice but to take up arms in a fight against his once trusted brother. Mega Man 5 carries over the same graphical style and action-platforming gameplay as the four preceding chapters in the series. The game introduces a new character, Beat, which the player can use as a weapon once a series of eight collectable letters are found. Mega Man 5 was met with an average to fairly positive critical reception, with the one major complaint being its lack of originality in either its plot or gameplay. Like other NES games in the series, Mega Man 5 has been re-released in Japan on the PlayStation and mobile phones and in North America as part of the Mega Man Anniversary Collection.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "November 25, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Capcom", "publishers": "Capcom", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.94", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockman_Complete_Works", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/43315-rockman-5-complete-works\n"}
