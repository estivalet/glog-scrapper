{"altername_name": ["J.

It featured narration by Jon Kabira and commentary by Yasutaro Matsuki, a former Japanese football player and manager. An updated version of this game, modified to include international teams, was later released as Goal Soccer '97 (or 'International Superstar Soccer Pro' in some regions). The 1996 season can be included in the \"Golden Age\" as in back then J.League was at its popularity peak, and many likeable superstars were playing in it: Guido Buchwald, Uwe Bein, Dragan Stojkovi\u0107, Daniele Massaro, Salvatore Schillaci, Basile Boli, Ivan Ha\u0161ek, Jorginho, Zinho, Dunga, Ed\u00edlson, Mazinho Oliveira, Careca, Evair, C\u00e9sar Sampaio, Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Zago, Ruy Ramos, Masashi Nakayama, Hiroshi Nanami, Hidetoshi Nakata, among many others. Both the playstyle and the league format (double stage with Victory Goal and Final match at the end) were very characteristic and promoted overly offensive, stylish and spectacular football. Up to two players can compete in a series of games that include: Exhibition, full J.League season, Hyper cup, All-Star match and Penalty Kick modes.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "November 22, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.League_Jikkyou_Winning_Eleven_%2797", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orA0Gu-7LRc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/157379-jleague-jikkyou-winning-eleven-97\n"}
