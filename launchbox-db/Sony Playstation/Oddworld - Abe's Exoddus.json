{"altername_name": ["Abe'99", "Oddworld: L'Exode d'Abe"], "name": "Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus", "overview": "Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus is a 2D platform game very similar to its predecessor both visually and gameplay-wise. Like in the previous game, Abe has to outsmart his foes and avoid obstacles rather than confront them directly. The game is larger than its predecessor and is more oriented towards puzzle-solving, featuring more complex interaction with the Mudokons, who can now be angry, wired, depressed, sick, or blind. The first three problematic conditions can be removed with the appropriate \"Gamespeak\" command; sick Mudokons must be cured with a special item, while blind ones will follow Abe's voice and may fall to their deaths if Abe doesn't stop them in time.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "October 31, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Oddworld Inhabitants", "publishers": "GT Interactive", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.38", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oddworld:_Abe%27s_Exoddus", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEx8lxXCsU4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/9064-oddworld-abes-exoddus\n"}
