{"altername_name": [], "name": "Iron Man / X-O Manowar in Heavy Metal", "overview": "Marvel Comics' stars Iron Man and X-O Manowar have teamed up to save the world from their ruthless enemies. Choose either character and get ready to blast through eight levels spanning multiple zones: Nuclear Plant, Stark Enterprises, New York City, Rain Forest, Isle, Drill Platform, Dromak Ship and Cyberspace. Each area is filled with troops such as Spider Alien Soldiers (armed with laser blasters) and various defenses including laser turrets, cannons and electrical traps. Luckily, both characters have a few moves at their disposal to combat these threats. Iron Man and X-O Manowar can fire short blasts of energy from their arms, hover in the air, punch and kick, fire chest weapons, and pick up and throw objects. Since enemies will appear in both the foreground and background, you can also fire weapons on either plane! Various power-ups include first-aid kits to replenish each character's armor, one-up icons to add to their number of lives, and continue icons to let players resume progress after dying. The game also features several boss characters at the conclusion of each zone, such as Goliath, Yellowjacket, Titania, Mr. Hyde and many more. Bring along a second player for simultaneous action!", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "October 31, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Realtime Associates", "publishers": "Acclaim Entertainment", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.42", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Man_and_X-O_Manowar_in_Heavy_Metal", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hp51Tw0PGY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/12268-iron-man-x-o-manowar-in-heavy-metal\n"}
