{"altername_name": [], "name": "Reverthion", "overview": "Reverhion is the Playstation version of the game called Hyper Reverthion available for the Sega Saturn, the game got also a sequel called Koutetsu Reiki Steeldom. Reverthion is a Virtual On wanna be in many ways yet different enough not to be classed as a complete rip off. The game features fantasy based robotic creatures which are piloted by different members. As in Steeldom the game is difficult to control though which makes playing it at first really hard. Once you've mastered the controls though you'll find yourself enjoying this nice little game. The game got 3 different modes: 1 - Try mode: Sort of a practice mode 2 - Story mode: Defeat all the opponents to advance in the game's plot. 3 - VS Mode: Fight againts the computer or another human player.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "December 1, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "TechnoSoft", "publishers": "Technosoft", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/112167-reverthion\n"}
