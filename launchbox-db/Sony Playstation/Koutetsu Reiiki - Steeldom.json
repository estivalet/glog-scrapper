{"altername_name": [], "name": "Koutetsu Reiiki: Steeldom", "overview": "In the aftermath of a great supernatual war, one of the few forms of entertainment is a fighting tournament between users of \"Ryoga\", a mystical power that manifest souls as a suit of mechanized battle armor. Eight warriors enter the tournament; some seek fame and fortune, some seek a better life, and some simply fight for the thrill. Steeldom is a third-person arena-based action game and a follow-up to Reverthion by the same developers. It plays very similarly to Sega's Virtual On, and includes eight playable characters each with their own unique moveset and abilities. There is a single-player campaign with unique endings for each character, as well as a 2-player split screen versus mode; the Saturn version adds system link support for two-player matches between two consoles.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "August 30, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "TechnoSoft", "publishers": "Technosoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/33432-koutetsu-reiiki-steeldom\n"}
