{"altername_name": ["SuperLite 1500 Series: The Game Maker"], "name": "The Game Maker: Ureyuki 100-manbon Get da ze!", "overview": "The Game Maker puts the player in the role of a chief of a team of game programmers, the player can hire new members for his programmer's team, buy new items to make them feel more appreaciated and that way they work better, etc. The gameplay is about that for each game to be completed there are some parts that have to be done by each programmer, for example a part of the game with the colour green can only be done by a member of the team that knows about the green subject. To make them work the player have to first use his computer to make the plan of work and after that put it on the programmer's desk so he (or she) will start working on that part, the same for the rest of parts of each game. Since the game used some sort of personality for each team members, they will need to rest to work better, and sometimes they will need to feel appreaciated (that how the gifts will help the player), a happy team member will work better than a tired or sad one. After completing a game they will see how the game is received and the company will receive the money of the game sales, sometimes they will also go to a Game Show where the team members will see if they work is or not well received by the possible players. After finishing the programming of each game they have to start working on the new one (that will need more programming to be fully completed).", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "September 23, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Aqua Rouge", "publishers": "Aqua Rouge", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/135316-the-game-maker-ureyuki-100-manbon-get-da-ze\n"}
