{"altername_name": [], "name": "Magic: The Gathering: Battlemage", "overview": "Magic: The Gathering - Battlemage is the real-time adaptation of the popular Magic collectible card game. The player assumes the role of a planeswalker, a powerful magician in the world of Dominaria, the world containing the most magical energy in Magic's universe of Dominia. The goal of the player is to defeat one opposing planeswalker in the Duel mode of the game, or to wage a campaign against all five of his rivals on a thirty-territory map comprising the continent of Corondor. To achieve victory, the player must cast spells against his opponent, which take the form of creatures and energy that will attack the player's adversary. At the same time, the player's rival is also casting spells, in an effort to destroy the player's planeswalker. The spells at the player's disposal are drawn from the Magic collectible card game, from their 4th edition and Mirage sets. These spells are depicted by icons intended to \"represent\" each spell, which must be identified in order that the player cast the spell intended.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "August 1, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Realtime Associates Seattle Division", "publishers": "Acclaim Entertainment", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering_video_games#Magic:_The_Gathering:_BattleMage", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/33990-magic-the-gathering-battlemage\n"}
