{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mini-Yonku Bakusou Kyoudai: Let's & Go!! WGP Hyper Heat", "overview": "Let's and Go WGP Hyper Heat follows closely to the 4wd mini racer anime. You start off with your own mini racer and win parts to customize your car. All you get to do in this game is customize your car and put them IN a race, but not actually control them during a race. This makes up for repetitive gameplay and limited fun. However, it puts into account what the actual hobby is like.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "November 20, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "C-Lab", "publishers": "Jaleco Entertainment", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.79", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/110354-mini-yonku-bakusou-kyoudai-lets-go-wgp-hyper-heat\n"}
