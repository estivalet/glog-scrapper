{"altername_name": [], "name": "Soccer '97", "overview": "Eidos get the season underway with Soccer '97, their updated version of Olympic Soccer. Soccer '97 now holds a PFA licence which allows the use of Premier and selected First Division teams, each with a full updated squad of pro players. The games are played to capacity crowds in multi-tiered stadiums, while all of the action can be viewed from a selection of camera angles that range from pitch level to top down. The cameras are positioned on the sidelines, at the corner flag or behind the goal. Alan Green once again provides the ball-by-ball commentary like in Olympic Soccer. The game options include a 1-2 player Exhibition game, where two teams are selected to play in a one-off friendly match. Arcade is a 32 team KO played over six rounds where only one team may be entered, but two players can join forces against the computer. A four group tournament can be set up by highlighting the teams that you wish to take part, with the group winners fighting it out for the trophy. Soccer '97 also gives you the option to play a season in your own custom built league of between three and twenty teams.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "March 10, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Silicon Dreams", "publishers": "Eidos Interactive", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/89883-soccer-97\n"}
