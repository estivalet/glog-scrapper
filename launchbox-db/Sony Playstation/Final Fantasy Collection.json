{"altername_name": [], "name": "Final Fantasy Collection", "overview": "Final Fantasy Collection is a compilation of three Final Fantasy games: Final Fantasy IV, Final Fantasy V, and Final Fantasy VI, released in Japan for the Sony PlayStation. The games are enhanced remakes of titles originally produced for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Although the games differ little from the original versions in terms of gameplay, graphics, and sound, a number of additional sequences are included, including art galleries, bestiaries, and full-motion video cutscenes. All three games were also released separately between 1997 and 1999. Although Final Fantasy Collection was never released outside of Japan, the games themselves were marketed to North American and European audiences in different collections. In North America, the PlayStation remakes of Final Fantasy V and Final Fantasy VI were included as part of Final Fantasy Anthology, while the remake of Final Fantasy IV was included as part of Final Fantasy Chronicles. In Europe, Final Fantasy IV and Final Fantasy V were packaged as part of the PAL version of Final Fantasy Anthology, while Final Fantasy VI was released separately.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "March 11, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Square", "publishers": "Square", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.3", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Final_Fantasy_video_games#Compilations", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/96034-final-fantasy-collection\n"}
