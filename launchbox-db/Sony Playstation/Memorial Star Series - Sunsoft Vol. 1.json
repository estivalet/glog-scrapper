{"altername_name": ["Memorial Series: Sunsoft Vol. 1", "Sunsoft Classics Vol.1"], "name": "Memorial Star Series: Sunsoft Vol. 1", "overview": "Contains two real gems from Sunsoft's back catalogue: Ikki and Super Arabian. In Ikki you must collect the money whilst avoiding ninjas - made far more appealing by Sunsoft's imagination: daikon and latern power ups as well as the appearance of a rather rough looking geisha of questionable gender to be avoided at all costs. In Super Arabian letters must be collected to form a word and clear the Middle Eastern themed level. Simple, yet fiendish: classic old school material of gameplay over graphics.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "October 4, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sunsoft", "publishers": "Sunsoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/80385-memorial-star-series-sunsoft-vol-1\n"}
