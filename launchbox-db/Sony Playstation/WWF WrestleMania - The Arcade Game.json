{"altername_name": [], "name": "WWF WrestleMania: The Arcade Game", "overview": "WWF Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game merges the personalities and action of the popular WWF TV show characters with a Mortal Kombat-style fighting game. This title features digitized graphics of 8 WWF superstars: Doink, Razor Ramon, Bret \"Hit Man\" Hart, Shawn Michaels, The Undertaker, Yokozuna, Bam Bam Bigelow, and Lex Luger. Although presented as a wrestling title, this game is structured like a one-on-one fighter, features over-the-top special moves characteristic of WWF. Each match is divided into a series of rounds, much like a fighting game. Instead of each round ending in a KO, it simply ends when the player forces the other wrestler(s) to fall by reducing their energy meter. Game modes include single player arcade mode, tournament mode, and versus mode for one-on-one multiplayer. Step into the ring with eight of the biggest stars in the WWF including Brett The Hitman Hart and the Undertaker. Wear down the opposition with standard wrestling moves, and then climb the ropes for some high-flying action. If you are taking a beating, you can quickly turn things around by using one of the character-specific special moves. Try to stake your claim on the championship belt in WWF WRESTLEMANIA: The Arcade Game.
