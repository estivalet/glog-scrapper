{"altername_name": ["SuperLite 1500 Series: Battle Qix"], "name": "Battle Qix", "overview": "Qix was an arcade game, released by Taito America Corporation in 1981. The objective of Qix is to fence off, or \u201cclaim\u201d, a supermajority of the playfield. At the start of each level, the playing field is a large, empty rectangle, containing the Qix, a stick-like entity that performs graceful, but unpredictable motions within the confines of the rectangle. Battle Qix was released for the PlayStation in 2002 by Success, under their SuperLite 1500 budget title series, and one of the last releases in the Qix series. It includes a remake of the original Qix, alongside a competitive multiplayer mode.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "October 24, 2002", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Taito", "publishers": "Success", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.44", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qix#Sequels", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVhlLqzlKr0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/156511-battle-qix\n"}
