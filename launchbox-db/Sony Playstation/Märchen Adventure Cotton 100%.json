However, in addition to many unique stages and enemies, the theme and colors in this game are much brighter, and the actual level mapping is significantly different from the first game.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "March 27, 2003", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Success", "publishers": "Success", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.39", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/24384-marchen-adventure-cotton-100\n"}
