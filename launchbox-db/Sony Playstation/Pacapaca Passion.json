{"altername_name": ["Paca Paca Passion"], "name": "Pacapaca Passion", "overview": "Paca Paca Passion is a rhythm game with dancers; however, this is very different then Bust A Move. I thank the closest game that I could compare this to is Beat Mania or Pop\u2019n Music. There is a bar on the far left and right of the screen, a white line moves down this bar, and when you see a colored line on the bar, you press the corresponding button when the white bar moves over it. You choose one of 4 characters, and then (depending on what character you choose) you will play a distinctive part in the song. Miruka plays the piano while Coke plays the guitar and there are 2 other characters for brass keyboard (Plica) and drums (Geroppa). Paca Paca Passion is the first game in the Paca Paca Passion series of music games made by Namco and that are conversion of Arcade Machines made too by Namco. The game features different melodies and game modes, and also a vs mode against a computer or another human player.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "June 24, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Produce!", "publishers": "Produce!", "genres": "Music", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/96719-pacapaca-passion\n"}
