{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tenshi Doumei", "overview": "Tenshi Doumei combines battlefield tactics and mech upgrades for an entertaining title. At face value, Tenshi is a tactical strategy RPG where you move units and attack or defend against cadres of adversaries. Attacks consist of long range artillery attacks and close-range bouts where you invariably punch an enemy mech. The drawback of a punch is that the opponent will counter-attack within the close range. A long range fire attack will not prompt any return fire. Close range attacks are preferable in the first few levels because they inflict more damage.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "April 23, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "TGL", "publishers": "TGL", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/136016-tenshi-doumei\n"}
