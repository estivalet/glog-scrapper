The conflict has directly affected every continent on earth and nearly every space colony and lunar settlement. Zeon has the upper hand through their use of a new type of weapon, called humanoid mobile suits. A Zeon recon team disobeys mission orders and attacks an unfinished base called Side 7. Its citizens accidentally find the Federation's new weapon called the Gundam. The newly formed crew of refugees, with support from Earth Federation soldiers stationed aboard the MS carrier White Base set out to change the course of the One Year War. Kidou Senshi Gundam - Giren no Yabou - Zeon no Keifu is a strategy game in which the player takes control of the Zeon army. In addition to giving orders to generals, you also had to carry out negotiations and develop new weapons. Giren's Greed is a game where the entire events of the One Year War, and beyond to Zeta, are laid out for the player to toy with as they see fit. Don't like the Federation taking a big hit with Operation Stardust, stop it. Don't like Ranba Ral dying against the Gundam and Whitebase, don't send him. The game allows the player to construct a variety of what-if scenarios using different points in the storyline as a starting place. Unfortunately, the game can follow the storyline quite closely, which for Zeon spells a shortend game. I won't spoil the story at this point in the guide; that comes later. This guide will provide you with the branches of the plot and various side events so that you'll be able to craft the story the way you want it to be. Zeon will be led to victory the way it should have been. Zieg Zeon! The first disc is the Earth Federation Disc and the second one is the Zeon Disc.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "February 10, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bandai", "publishers": "Bandai", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109795-kidou-senshi-gundam-gihren-no-yabou-zeon-no-keifu\n"}
