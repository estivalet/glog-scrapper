{"altername_name": ["Trap Runner", "Trap Gunner"], "name": "Trap Gunner: Countdown to Oblivion", "overview": "Trap Gunner has you playing as one of six secret agents trained in explosives, espionage, and combat. A ruthless organization known as GAIN has done the unthinkable: to keep agents from interfering with its plans for world conquest, it has somehow managed to pit them against each other. Now you must fight each agent on one of 36 battlefields. Trap Gunner is a game where the object is to eliminate the other agent using traps, a gun, hand-to-hand combat, or any combination thereof. You'll play from a split-screen, three-quarter perspective inside factory-type environments filled with stairs, slopes, bridges, conveyor belts, and hazards. Each character carries three types of traps from the following choices: mines, pitfalls, poisonous gas, force panels (which send the victim in an opposite direction), or switch detonators. Characters also differ in speed and default weapons, making certain players deadlier up close than from afar. While you can disarm the opponent's trap by entering what is described as \"caution mode,\" you'll have to be careful: if you don't enter the disarming code within the time limit, it will detonate. Game types include Tutorial Mode, Story Mode, and Versus Mode. A record screen displays each character's wins, losses, and draws as well as the best clear times for each stage.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "August 6, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Racdym", "publishers": "Atlus", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.09", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trap_Gunner", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/3oPAzBxjnLg?t=5", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/12541-trap-gunner-countdown-to-oblivion\n"}
