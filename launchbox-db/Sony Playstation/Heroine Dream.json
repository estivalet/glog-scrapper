{"altername_name": [], "name": "Heroine Dream", "overview": "A school makes a contest to know which one will be the best heroine. They send scouts all over the country and select 5 girls. The player controls one of those girls and have to select that girl's training each week to improve her stats and make her win the contest. During those weeks she will meet different character to interact with and can play different mini games in the town. The \"heroine\" is more sort of a pop idol, since after a few weeks of training the girls will have to go to auditions in TV, radios, magazines, etc and show if they got talent or not (singing, dancing, acting, etc.). The player can also take a walk around the town in places that will be unlocked during the weeks. Depending of the player choices the girl will continue to be a normal girl or become the heroine that the town wants.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "October 10, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Map Japan", "publishers": "Map Japan", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109344-heroine-dream\n"}
