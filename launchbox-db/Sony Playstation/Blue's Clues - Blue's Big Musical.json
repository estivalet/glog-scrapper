Based on the Nickelodeon television series BLUE\u2019S CLUES, this is a creative, original game for the younger set. Blue, Steve, and all the rest of the gang have to solve difficult puzzles in order to put together the best possible show, and you\u2019re the perfect person to help them. Select different songs to put into the review, and then get rewarded by having the cast actually perform them! Perfect for children ages 3-6 (especially if they\u2019re already fans of the show), BLUE\u2019S CLUES: Blue\u2019s Big Musical features stellar graphics, great voice acting, and animates on that\u2019s lifted straight from the show. Blending educational values and good, old-fashioned fun, BLUE\u2019S CLUES: Blue\u2019s Big Musical can be played alone, but is truly wonderful as a two-player collaborative effort.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "August 24, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "EC - Early Childhood", "developers": "Terraglyph", "publishers": "THQ", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/32718-blues-clues-blues-big-musical\n"}
