{"altername_name": [], "name": "True Love Story: Remember My Heart", "overview": "True Love Story is a series of four dating sims (as distinct from the similar but unrelated title True Love). True Love Story and True Love Story 2 were released by ASCII for the PlayStation. True Love Story 3 and True Love Story: Summer Days, and yet... were released by Enterbrain for the PlayStation 2. The True Love Story land are notable for their geko, or walk-home system. When the player asks a girl to walk home with him from school, the game enters a special conversation mode. In this mode, in addition to the usual long-term, strategic \"love meter\", the girl you are conversing with has a short-term, tactical \"heartthrob meter\" representing her level of immediate interest in the conversation with you. The player is given the choice of approximately 30 topics of conversation to choose from, and the heartthrob meter will increase or decrease based on the appropriateness of his selections. High heartthrob can then be leveraged to ask the girl out on a date, or simply to effect a permanent increase in her love meter. Later True Love Story games added further complexity to this system, such as a \"combo\" system measuring the number of consecutive good choices of conversation topics. In large part because of this system, True Love Story is one of the most gameplay-rich dating sims. True Love Story - Remember my heart is the second game in the True Love Stories series for the Playstation One console and the game is also a dating simulation set in a Japanese high school where you must charm your way into the heart of Nozomi, Midori or even Saeko sensei! The game features a complete picture gallery and unlockable galleries of all the girls of the game.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "December 11, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bits Laboratory", "publishers": "Ascii Entertainment", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113185-true-love-story-remember-my-heart\n"}
