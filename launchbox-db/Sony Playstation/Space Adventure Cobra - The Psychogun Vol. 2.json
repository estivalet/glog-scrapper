At the start of the story he is living an ordinary life but after going to a trip-parlor he starts to regain his true memories. If you're a fan of Buichi Terasawa, the best part of this comic is that it lets you experience graphics on a monitor as if they were drawn on a computer. For the people who haven't played this game, you can expect to experience beautiful graphics, realistic sound effects, music that builds and builds like in a movie, and a new level of entertainment that you have never known. This is the second part of the story, and starts where the first game ended.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "January 22, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Sony", "publishers": "Sony", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/112425-space-adventure-cobra-the-psychogun-vol-2\n"}
