Change the rules of play for arcade, custom or simulation game with control over the difficulty level to time length of actual play from 5 minutes (10-minute default) to a maximum 25 minutes. Players can choose \"exhibition play\" for practice matches between teams, before committing to one team for a 30-game \"season play\" or six-round \"tournament play\" in prearranged series of scheduled games against 36 different countries of various abilities. The latter two allows for simulated games to skip matches - if desired with results automatically calculated by the computer. View statistics of your team before embarking in a match to determine the best on-court positions from point guard to centre of talented team members according to their performance and capabilities. Freely adjust player attributes from height, weight, strength, endurance to ball handling skills.
