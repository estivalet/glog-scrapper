{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tail Concerto", "overview": "Your adventure takes place in the land of Prairie, where all of the locations are floating islands and each one has special characteristics. In this land, Dog-People are the dominate species, but there are also some Cat-People that live here. Even though the Dog-People show no signs of hostility, some of the Cat-People have formed a gang called the \"Black Cats\" that terrorize the Dog-People and demand retribution for wrongs committed on them many years ago. This is where you come in. As Waffle, an honest and genuine Prairie Police Officer, you must uphold the law in your Police-Robo and stop the shenanigans of the \"Black Cats\" gang. They are led by Alicia, who is a friend of yours from long ago, but now she doesn't think too kindly of you. Her sisters, Stare and Flare, will also be at her side during your battles. Later on, you'll learn of legends about an ancient civilization and the creation of the Iron Giant. Your ultimate goal is to stop the \"Black Cats\" and collect five power crystals before the gang does. Your Police-Robo can do many things, such as climb, run, swat, shoot encapsulation bubbles, and many other functions, depending on your situation and objectives. You must learn each skill to properly suit yourself for each situation.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "October 25, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "CyberConnect", "publishers": "Atlus", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.20", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/11440-tail-concerto\n"}
