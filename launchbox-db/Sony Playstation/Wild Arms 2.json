Where one hero must sacrifice his heart for peace. Where courage and fear, love and malice, heroes and villains go hand in hand. It's power that exceeds human knowledge. It's neither dream nor reality. It;s what legends are made of. Refined Battle System delivers more strategy and challenge: Each character has special abilities and acquires their abilities differently. Evade battles with enemies that are less powerful than you. Attack specific body parts of boss enemies.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "September 2, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Contrail", "publishers": "Sony Computer Entertainment", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.89", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Arms_2", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcbCdb8Pi3s", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/11212-wild-arms-2\n"}
