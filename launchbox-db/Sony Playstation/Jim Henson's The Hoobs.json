{"altername_name": [], "name": "Jim Henson's The Hoobs", "overview": "The Hoobs is a BAFTA-winning children's television programme created and produced by The Jim Henson Company. It stars five creatures called Hoobs (Hubba Hubba, Iver, Groove, Tula, and Roma) from the fictional Hoobland, and their interactions with Earth and the human race. In each episode they try to find the answer to a question to be put in the great Hoobopaedia created by Hubba Hubba, back in Hoobland, in hopes of learning all there is to know. Hubba Hubba remains in Hoobland; Iver, Groove, and Tula live in the Hoobmobile; and Roma travels to all parts of the world. The five creatures are puppets, but the show also includes some animated sequences as well as live motion of human children who explain concepts to the Hoobs. Jim Hensons colorful creations, The Hoobs, have entertained TV audiences worldwide and are now bringing their muppet-style fun and learning to the PlayStation. The Runecraft-developed game follows the adventures of Iver, Tula and Groove as they embark on a voyage of discovery around Hoobland, sharing their experiences with other Hoobs via an enormous database -- known as the Hoobopaedia -- as well as the local news station and the internet. Half action game, half edutainment title, kids stand to find a whole load of stuff just waiting to be discovered, as well as some interesting Hoob language.
