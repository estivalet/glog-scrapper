This strains his relationship with his wife Carolyn (Teri Garr) and his young son Dougie. However, this suddenly changes when a mix-up at the hospital (caused by a bus driver who is trying to hide his recent use of marijuana) makes him believe that he has two weeks to live. He subsequently finds out that his family will only receive a small amount of money if he dies of natural causes, but will receive hundreds of thousands if he is killed in the line of duty. He determines that he will find a way to make that happen.
