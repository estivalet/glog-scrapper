{"altername_name": ["Mega Man 8", "Rockman 8"], "name": "Mega Man 8: Anniversary Edition", "overview": "Mega Man 8 is a continuation of the original Mega Man series storyline. Cutscenes in the game are presented both in-game and with newly introduced anime-style full-motion videos. Like other games in the series, it takes place in an unspecified year during the 21st century (20XX). The game opens as two alien robots engage in a climactic battle in the depths of space. Ultimately both of them plummet towards Earth, critically injured. Meanwhile, Mega Man and his canine companion Rush are called by Dr. Light to investigate strange energy readings on a nearby island. On the island, Mega Man finds Dr. Wily flying away with a strange purple orb. Before chasing him, he sees a damaged robot and asks for Dr. Light to pick it up and try to repair it. Dr. Wily then releases four new Robot Masters to combat Mega Man, Frost Man, Tengu Man, Clown Man, and Grenade Man. Each time he destroys one, the robotic hero receives a purple orb like the one Dr. Wily confiscated. Each of the Robot Masters are empowered with a strange energy, and it seems that this power comes from the new energy cores that Wily has infused them with.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "December 17, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Capcom", "publishers": "Capcom", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.83", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_Man_8", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0cExHbZHPk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/542-mega-man-8-anniversary-edition\n"}
