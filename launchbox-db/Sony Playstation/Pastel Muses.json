The major difference is in how the balls are moved, the player controls a character that is on charge of somekind of cannonball that used to shot the different colour balls, the more the button is pressed the farther the ball will go. There are different game modes like the story mode in which the player controls a cute character that after passing a few levels have to defeat each level boss. There is also a vs mode in which 2 players can compete between them.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "August 21, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Soft Office", "publishers": "Soft Office", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/96630-pastel-muses\n"}
