Tintin: Destination Adventure successfully combines five different quests and rolls them into one. It is based on these classic adventures; The Black Island, Land of Black Gold, Red Rackham's Treasure, Explorers on the Moon and Flight 714. You may have read these stories, but have you ever experienced them through Tintin's eyes? To join these adventures together, a dream sequence is used. Tintin is going to the presentation of Professor Calculus's new invention, but the new creation isn't working, as usual. Meanwhile, Snowy falls asleep and starts dreaming about the wild adventures that they have been on together. The gameplay in Tintin: Destination Adventure is as varied as the adventures themselves. Many of the 21 levels play completely differently to one another. The main genres incorporated are platform, flying, racing and several other bonus games. You'll need to be good at several diverse styles of gameplay if you want to complete this game. So travel to the desert, visit an exotic island and even go to the moon with your new friends Tintin and Snowy.
