{"altername_name": [], "name": "Yarudora Series Vol.1: Double Cast", "overview": "Yarudora Series vol.1 - Double Cast begins when the protagonist in Double Cast crashes on a pile of garbage after stumbling home after a night of drinking with fellow members of a film club. While still asleep, drunk, and foul, a girl named Mitsuki Akasaka rouses the protagonist up. It soon becomes clear that Mitsuki has lost her memory but still remembers her name. Help Mitsuki remember her circumstances and possibly regain her memory in a flick screen interactive adventure. The Yarudora (a conjunction of Yaru Dorama which translates to \"Drama that You Do\") series of games all followed a central theme where a girl with amnesia enters the player's life. With the appearance of the girl, an interactive adventure follows where the story plays out in animated motion with choices to select along the way which affect the ultimate outcome. Features in the game include a graphics gallery, a replay function, and the ability to view various endings once they are achieved during a normal game. The game features 27 endings: 4 Good Endings, 6 Normal endings, and 17 Bad Endings. The game was also released in PSP a few years later.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "June 25, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Production I.G.", "publishers": "Sony Computer Entertainment", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113298-yarudora-series-vol1-double-cast\n"}
