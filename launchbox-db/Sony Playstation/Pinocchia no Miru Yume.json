{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pinocchia no Miru Yume", "overview": "This is a story that's based on the well-known fairy-tale \"The Adventures of Pinocchio\". You can choose between a male and female protagonist, and play as a doll/puppet maker who's about to starve to death on Chirstmas Eve due to the inability to make a \"pinocchia\", a doll that looks and acts like a real human being (but isn't truely alive), and make enough money to feed yourself. As you slip into unconsciousness, you plead to any higher being that's listening to grant you a pinocchia, willing to give your life in exchange.... and wake up the next morning, with a \"new-born\" pinocchia in your hands. This pinocchia is apparently created from part of your life energy, and can actually grow as time passes. So the responsibility falls to you to raise this pinocchia (rather funny, since the previous evening before the protagonist couldn't even feed him/herself), although the method you use is entirely up to you. You can love it, care for it, or neglect and abuse it, and how the pinocchia develops will be based on your actions. Assuming the worst ending isn't the pinocchia running away or breaking (death, in a sense), regardless of what you do, the pinocchia will eventually grow up to turn into one of six types, 3 for each gender (all pictured on the front cover). Each male or female pinocchia has his or her own personality (as mentioned, subtly decided by your actions), and if you're playing as the opposite gender protagonist, then it's even possible to develop a romantic relationship with your pinocchia in the end.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "August 5, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Takara", "publishers": "Takara", "genres": "Life Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/111882-pinocchia-no-miru-yume\n"}
