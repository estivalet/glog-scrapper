{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bushido Blade 2", "overview": "Bushido Blade 2 takes place sometime after the events in the original game and is also a weapon fighting game without health bars, power displays, or over-the-top special maneuvers. The game features the Story Mode, Versus Mode and Slash mode present in the original game as well as a new tournament mode, where the two sides face each other with shinai and other bamboo weapons in a kendo like ring. Fighters have different styles (including some with two sword nito and iaijutsu styles) and there are many weapons to choose from (although the hammer has been replaced with the yari spear). The controls have changed somewhat, but stances are still in the game, as are one-hit kills if blows strike a sensitive part of the body. Initially players can choose from six warriors, three from each clan. As progress is made in the story mode, supporting characters will be encountered. If beaten, those characters will become available for play in the game's other modes.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "February 28, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Square", "publishers": "Square", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.87", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushido_Blade_2", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-i5KCe2lfg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/8058-bushido-blade-2\n"}
