{"altername_name": ["SD Gundam - GGeneration-F"], "name": "SD Gundam G Generation F", "overview": "SD Gundam G Generation is a series of strategy-RPG video games that focus on the Gundam anime franchise. HISTORY: The G Generation series technically began in 1996, when Bandai released a series of six games for Nintendo's Super Famicom console's Sufami Turbo add-on, each focusing on a particular era from the Gundam multiverse. A Generation focused on the One Year War, B Generation focused on the Gryps Conflict, and so forth up to F Generation, which covered the plot of G Gundam. Instead of continuing the obvious progression and making a G Generation game themed about Gundam Wing, Bandai held on to the title. Since \"G\" was often used as an abbreviation for \"Gundam\", it was decided that G Generation would encompass a wider scope. When it was finally released in 1998 for the PlayStation, G Generation covered the plot for Mobile Suit Gundam through Char's Counterattack and featured characters from the remaining Universal Century series as well as G Gundam, Gundam Wing and Gundam X. SD Gundam G Generation for PlayStation One covers events of Mobile Suit Gundam through Char's Counterattack with characters and mecha from later series as bonuses. There are a total of 42 stages in the game's Situation Mode which highlights certain key events in the Gundam universe from the year U.C. 0079 to U.C. 0093. STORY: It is the year U.C. 0079. The Zion Dukedom on Side 3 declares war against the Earth Federation. Using their newly developed Zaku II Mobile Suits, they were able to overpower the Federation forces. They even pumped poisonous gases into several colonies, killing all its inhabitants, and then dropping these colonies on Earth. Unable to tolerate such an act, General Revil leads a fleet of Federation ships into space to confront the Zions. This battle is known as the \"Battle of Rum\". SD Gundam G Generation-F (covers events of all Gundam anime through Gundam X as well as many manga and video game spinoffs such as Gundam Sentinel, Crossbone Gundam, and G-Unit/Last Outpost.
