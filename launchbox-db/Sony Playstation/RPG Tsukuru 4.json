{"altername_name": ["RPG Tkool 4"], "name": "RPG Tsukuru 4", "overview": "RPG Maker, known in Japan as RPG Tsukuru, is the name of an expansive series of programs for the development of role-playing games (RPGs), first created by the Japanese group ASCII, then succeeded by Enterbrain. The Japanese name, Tsukuru, is a pun mixing the Japanese word tsukuru, which means \"make\" or \"create\", with tsuru, the Japanese transcription of the English word \"tool\". The RPG Maker series has been released primarily in Japan, with later versions also released in East Asia, North America, Europe, and Australia. RPG Tsukuru 4, for the PlayStation 1, was the only one in the series of console games not localized for the USA. RPG Tsukuru 4 was the sequel to our RPG Maker 1, but it stayed in Japan. Sprites now had their own portraits for dialogue and the sprites themselves were much more detailed. The best changes though were the battle system and the addition of variables and timers. Scripting and events are seperated like in RPG Maker 2, and variables show up for the first time in a console RPG Maker. There are 126 selectable enemies, counting the slots for custom enemies. The game's second disk contained an enhanced Anime Maker, where players could meticulously create frames and even more frames for their custom sprite characters.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "December 7, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Agenda", "publishers": "Enterbrain", "genres": "Sandbox", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/112179-rpg-tsukuru-4\n"}
