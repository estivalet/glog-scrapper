{"altername_name": ["ATV Quad Power Racing"], "name": "ATV: Quad Power Racing", "overview": "Fire up your PlayStation for a four-wheel frenzy with ATV Quad Power Racing. ATV stands for All-Terrain Vehicle, and this game has a wide variety of both terrain and vehicles. You can slip through the snow, slide through the sand, and muck through the mud against computer-controlled riders like Sam Stone, Mitzi Chen, and Heather Gold, or you can challenge a friend and see if he has what it takes to motor to the finish. Choose one of three racers and head out to 12 tracks, racing against the clock or trying to beat the competition. Improve your skills and you\u2019ll unlock better, faster ATVs. If you get really good, you can graduate from amateur to pro and unlock harder tracks. So strap on your racing gear and get ready for ATV QUAD RACING!", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "August 23, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Climax Racing", "publishers": "Acclaim Entertainment", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.61", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATV:_Quad_Power_Racing", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/11715-atv-quad-power-racing\n"}
