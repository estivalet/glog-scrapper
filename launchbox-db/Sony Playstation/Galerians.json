Items must be collected to unlock new areas and advance the story. Unlike in most other games of the type, the protagonist is unable to use weapons. Rion fully relies on his psychic powers to combat enemies. These powers must be replenished by regularly taking drugs. In addition, Rion has a special meter that throws him into uncontrollable rage when full.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "August 26, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "M - Mature", "developers": "Polygon Magic", "publishers": "Crave Entertainment", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.69", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galerians", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7J6k2BW3jKY&t=393s", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/509-galerians\n"}
