Do you enjoy controlling characters from a movie who cause agony and suffering for the protagonists? Well, if you're looking for some all-out carnage and destruction, try feeding on Warpath: Jurassic Park for the PlayStation. Now you can control all of those scaly, angry and ferocious dinosaurs from the Jurassic Park and Jurassic Park: The Lost World movies. You will now truly find who can hold the title, \"King of the Thunderlizards.\" Within 3D arenas you will be able to claw and mangle your dinosaur opponents with your tail, claws, jaws and teeth. Execute devastating combos and grappling moves that will cause your foe to writhe in pain and gasp for its final breath. Each of the 14 unique dinosaurs has different abilities as well. Watch in awe as the brutal T-Rex devours and crushes its opponent with raw power and strength. Although the Raptor is quick, its deadly slashes teamed with razor-sharp claws may prove to be just as effective.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "October 31, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Black Ops Entertainment", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.57", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warpath:_Jurassic_Park", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8cmFqBx99M", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/11213-warpath-jurassic-park\n"}
