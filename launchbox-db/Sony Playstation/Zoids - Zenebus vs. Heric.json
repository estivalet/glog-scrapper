{"altername_name": ["Zoids: Teikoku vs Kyouwakoku: Meka Seitai no Idenshi"], "name": "Zoids: Zenebus vs. Heric", "overview": "Zoids is a multi-media model-kit-based franchise originating from Japanese toy company Tomy (now Takara-Tomy); though now produced by various companies through licenses. The majority of the franchise is built around and focused on the various model kit series. The franchise has expanded from strictly motorized model kits to highly detailed and posable model kits, action figures and even PVC figurines. The various anime series, comics, manga books and video games all serve as tie-in media products for the franchise, to expand both consumer base and franchise recognition. Zoids are fictional mechanical life-forms, found on the planet Zi. A Zoid is essentially a mechanical animal formed around a techno-organic 'core' (known as a \"Zoid Core\"), which serves as its heart and mind. The Core is considered to be 'alive', making the Zoid a living creature. Otherwise, its body is an artificial mechanical construct like any other mecha. Beginning fairly early after the start of the original Japanese Zoid releases, the battle story first introduced the conflict between two rival nations: the Helic Republic and Zenebas Empire. Their main weapons were Zoids, living war machines built from metal-based lifeforms native to planet Zi. The Zenebas Zoids were mostly red and silver and more armored, the Helic more skeletal and favoring blue and grey. Zoids - Zenebus vs Heric (aka Zoids - Teikoku vs Kyouwakoku - Mecha Seita no Idenshi) is a tactical RPG. The player can chose to play as either the Helic Republic or the Zenebas Empire. The Helic side is the \"easy\" mode, as the player starts out with a unit of One Godos, whereas the Zenebas side gives him a unit with an Iguan, Molga, Merda and Gator. The game is divided into different missions that the player has to complete. When a mission is completed, more Zoids are unlocked and can be bought and be added to the player units. In the gameplay when the player confronts an enemy on the field, the game starts up a turn-base 3DCG battle between the two Zoids. If the players character runs out of EP, it can't attack.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "November 22, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "TOMY", "publishers": "Tomy", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113333-zoids-zenebus-vs-heric\n"}
