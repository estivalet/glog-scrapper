{"altername_name": [], "name": "Um Jammer Lammy", "overview": "Um Jammer Lammy, the sequel to the PlayStation's first music game PaRappa the Rapper, is more than just a new collection of songs. This interactive game is focused on an entirely new character and has different styles of music, multiple musical contests, and an electric guitar to rock out on rather than rapping. You assume the role of Lammy, the unconfident guitar player for Milkcan -- one of the city's greatest garage-rock bands. Like PaRappa, the more you play, the more the story begins to unfold. As time goes on, Lammy will slowly gain confidence and improve her skills in the genres of rock, punk, heavy metal, and pop-rock tracks.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "March 18, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "NanaOn-Sha", "publishers": "Sony Computer Entertainment", "genres": "Music", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.24", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Um_Jammer_Lammy", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2174-um-jammer-lammy\n"}
