The game got a challenging gameplay but the difficulty level is really hard.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "October 29, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "ASK Kodansha", "publishers": "ASK Kodansha", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/135522-goryuujin-electro\n"}
