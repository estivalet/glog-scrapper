{"altername_name": [], "name": "WCW Backstage Assault", "overview": "WCW Backstage Assault takes over 50 WCW wrestlers out of the ring and into real-world venues like a locker room, garage and a loading dock. Traditional wrestling moves can be used, but weapons like two-by-fours and trash cans are also thrown into the mix. By working your way through the game's various modes, you can unlock additional wrestlers, areas and weapons. Bobby Heenan and Tony Schiavone provide the commentary with over 8,000 lines of dialogue. GAMEPLAY: Backstage Assault is vastly different from other games of its genre. Any wrestling game prior to it that featured backstage areas (such as the SmackDown! series or its predecessor, WCW Mayhem) treated them as auxiliary fighting locations. Backstage Assault took the concept further by removing the ring entirely and having all action take place backstage. Hardcore Challenge is Backstage Assault's primary gameplay mode. It consists of winning matches against random opponents until challenged by the champion. Throughout the game, players can unlock wrestlers, arenas, and moves for use in Create-a-Superstar. The player cannot defend the championship after earning it. Features: Choose from more than 50 WCW stars in an assortment of match types Fight in a total of 14 backstage areas, including a semi-trailer lot Use power-ups, weapons, and the environment to defeat your rivals", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "October 31, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Kodiak Interactive Software Studios", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/12889-wcw-backstage-assault\n"}
