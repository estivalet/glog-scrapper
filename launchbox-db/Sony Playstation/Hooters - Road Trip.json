{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hooters: Road Trip", "overview": "Fast cars, an open highway, and young women - Hooters Road Trip calls out to its target audience by its title alone. Players choose one of several classically styled muscle cars and hot rods to drive in freewheelin' races across the good ol' U. S. of A. Winners receive the singular reward of a chance to \"hang out\" with attractive Hooters Girls waitress characters, known to patrons of the owl-mascotted restaurant chain for their friendly service and distinguishingly informal \"short shorts and short shirt\" uniforms. The game features well over a dozen different automobiles, though many of these must be \"unlocked\" by skillful play. Races take place across the country in such fair weather locations as Florida and California. In the words of the restaurant's own slogan, \"Delightfully Tacky, Yet Unrefined.\"", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "March 26, 2002", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Hoplite Research", "publishers": "Ubi Soft", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.15", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/12798-hooters-road-trip\n"}
