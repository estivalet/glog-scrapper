Based on the 1996 movie, Space Jam is closely modeled after the NBA Jam series of arcade-style hoops action. As a member of the TuneSquad, your goal is to defeat the hulking, bruising Monstars in either two-on-two or three-on-three play from a side-view perspective. Fill your roster with such stars as Bugs Bunny, Porky Pig, Daffy Duck, Foghorn Leghorn, and Yosemite Sam, each individually rated in speed, shooting, and rebounds. In between quarters, you can participate in various mini-games to build up your team's attributes. Battle the computer in a five-match Intergalactic Tournament, team-up with a friend for cooperative play, or challenge a rival to a head-to-head match. Multitap owners can play with up to five friends in a three-on-three game.
