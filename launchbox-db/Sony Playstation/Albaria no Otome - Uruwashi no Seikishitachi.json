{"altername_name": ["Albalea No Otome: Uruwashi No Seishikitachi", "Arubarea no Otome: Uruwashi no Seikishitachi"], "name": "Albaria no Otome: Uruwashi no Seikishitachi", "overview": "In Albaria no Otome, you play one of the three girls who were summoned to the castle of the Queen of Albaria to study fighting and magical arts (you can name your heroine as you like, but the default name is Ashanty). As an additional reward - beside the graduation - you can try to impress and ultimately to win the heart of one of the five great knights of the kingdom. Your goal in the game is to make sure you become stronger and more charming than your two rivals, and to make a good impression on the Queen and the knights. You must plan a schedule for your studies in castle. You can choose which classes to visit and which not. Learning increases your abilities (for example, attending magic class will make your spells more powerful). Once in a while you'll have to help one of the knights to fight monsters. The battles take place on an isometric battle field, on which you can freely move your characters and attack or use spells when there are enemies in range. Your goal in battles is not only to win, but to make sure the heroine does some attacking instead of letting the powerful knights do the job.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "October 8, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "NCS", "publishers": "Masaya", "genres": "Life Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/135342-albaria-no-otome-uruwashi-no-seikishitachi\n"}
