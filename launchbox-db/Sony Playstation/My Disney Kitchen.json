{"altername_name": ["Kids Station - Mickey & Minnie no Magical Kitchen"], "name": "My Disney Kitchen", "overview": "Originally released by Disney Interactive in 1998 as a hybrid title for the Macintosh and PC, My Disney Kitchen gets re-cooked for the PlayStation, courtesy of BAM! Entertainment. Young chefs learn how to prepare various dishes, create meals and experiment with zany appliances, and acquire a practical sense of cleaning up after finished. More than 30 recipes are provided by FamilyFun Magazine, utilizing a fully stocked refrigerator and pantry in My Disney Kitchen. Gameplay encourages experimentation with ingredients, setting the table, arranging the room, serving food, and topping off concoctions with syrup, berries, and more. Whether fixing eggs, bacon, and pancakes for Minnie and Mickey Mouse, baking a cake, cooking a steak, or trying out recipes, kids can control the speed of the cursor and save the game at any time. Learning is reinforced by requirements to follow specific steps during the cooking process, including adjusting flame strength on burners, preparing ingredients and utensils (e.g., buttering pans, turning on the ventilation fan, washing pots and pans), and cleaning the kitchen. Features * Prepare 30 recipes from FamilyFun Magazine * Teaches concepts of cooking and cleaning up * Includes 30 clips from Disney animated films", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "June 10, 2002", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Disney Interactive Studios", "publishers": "BAM!
