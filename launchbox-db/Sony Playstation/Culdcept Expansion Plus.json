{"altername_name": [], "name": "Culdcept Expansion Plus", "overview": "Culdcept is a hybrid board/card game where the objective is to generate the most mana before making it back to the castle. Each player starts out with a deck of 50 cards. Card types range from monster cards (e.g. Skeleton), which are used to accumulate territory on the board to increase your mana; Equipment (e.g. Chain Mail), which will boost your monsters' abilities when they battle; and Magic (e.g. Holy Word 0), which can be used to help you or hinder the other players on the board. When a player lands on another player's monster, he/she can challenge it to a battle in an attempt to take over the territory. If the attacker wins, he/she gets the space on the board and additional mana. There are more than sixteen different game boards, each with different rules and layouts (such as the maximum number on dice rolls, the elements on the board, etc.)", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "November 30, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Omiya Soft", "publishers": "Media Factory", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.7", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/33104-culdcept-expansion-plus\n"}
