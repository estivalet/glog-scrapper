{"altername_name": [], "name": "Otenki Kororin", "overview": "From hardcore gamers much loved Takumi, which was created (along with Cave) from the fallout from Taoplan's demise, comes this distinctive puzzler. Usually more at home with shmups like Gigawing and Mars Matrix, Takumi demonstrates another string to its bow as you work to match weather symbols with some delightful characters. The symbols can be slid along sideways to make combo's, but it keeps it nice and frantic not having to concentrate purely on the top line as in Puyo Puyo et al. Very refreshing.
