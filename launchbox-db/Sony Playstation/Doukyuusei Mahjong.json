{"altername_name": [], "name": "Doukyuusei Mahjong", "overview": "Doukyuusei Mahjong is a 4-player riichi mahjong game based on the Doukyuusei series of adult adventure games. Unlike the earlier Mahjong Doukyuusei, this game is chaste and does not feature any strip mahjong elements. The main story mode is presented in a visual novel format similar to the original game, where the player can choose locations to visit which will trigger different events, leading to mahjong matches against different girls, and depending on the player's performance ultimately lead to numerous different endings. There is also a free mode where any of the 14 girls can be selected to play against, with a wide range of rule configuration options available, as well as a gallery mode where illustrations unlocked in the story mode can be freely viewed.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "January 17, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Aroma", "publishers": "Aroma", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133979-doukyuusei-mahjong\n"}
