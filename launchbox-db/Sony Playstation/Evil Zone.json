Knowing all too well that the foul monster will escape in due time, the Kumi citizens organized a tournament to find out who the strongest warrior is. Because of the imminent escape of Ihadurca, the strongest must step forward to win the tournament and ultimately face the inter-dimensional demon. Only one will survive the tournament, but whether or not that fighter can survive the power of Ihadurca is up to you. Evil Zone is a 3D, arena-based fighting game featuring over ten Japanese Manga inspired characters. Each one has his or her own unique reason for entering the tournament as well as special moves and combo attacks. You have the ability to execute long range projectile attacks as well as close quarters throws, kicks and punches. Characters also earn crystals (via a secondary power meter) that can be used to pull off very damaging maneuvers. There are five different gameplay options including survival, training, versus and story. The story mode is different for every character and features story screens in between battles. Completing the different stories unlocks hidden things, such as art galleries and a musical jukebox in which you can sample the game's music. The training mode helps you get used to the fighting system and the versus feature lets you fight it out with a friend.
