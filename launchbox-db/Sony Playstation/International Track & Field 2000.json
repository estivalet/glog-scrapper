The events take place in the USA, Russia, Germany, China, Cuba, Korea, France, Australia, Canada, Great Britain, Japan, and Kenya. As the sequel to the first International Track and Field video game for the PlayStation, the game features detailed faces and bodies, and motion-captured animations. Events include men's 100-meter, one kilometer time trial (biking), sprint (cycling), singles 500-meter (canoeing), long jump, pole vault, hammer throw, javelin throw, and clean and jerk (weightlifting). It also includes women's springboard (diving), 50-meter freestyle (swimming) and horse vault. In all of the events you have to repeatedly press pairs of buttons to get your athlete to continuously perform their actions; the faster you hit them the faster your athlete will move. Other events require timed-based preciseness. Certain events like diving and horse vault allow you to choose a specific move to pull off.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "October 31, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.8", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Track_%26_Field_2000", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbTtmlMxlrY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/12264-international-track-field-2000\n"}
