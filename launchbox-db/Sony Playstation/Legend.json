After years of studies the evil brother himself becomes a Dark Sorceror and is ready to stand up against his brother which he hates with all of his cold heart. But he can not do it alone. He needs an army, a force of warriors to break through the defences of his brother. He therefore turns to Morlock the Soulthief for help and support. The evil demons agrees to the vicious schemes of the King's brother under one circumstance: All souls in the kingdom will for eternity belong to Morlock for his personal satisfaction. Being so Morlock and the evil brother become allies. Allies in blood. Already an evil and sinister plan was forming in the heads of the rulers of darkness. Later in the castle of the King the loyal life guards Axel, Tara and Karo stand guard in front of the door to the throne room. Suddenly they hear a deafening noise and the King's cry for help. Swiftly they turn around and knock the door open with their weapons just in time to see a hideous gargoyle standing with the King in its arms. As Axel moves forward to stop the gargoyle two monsters step out of the dark and attack the fearless trio. In the meantime the gargoyle gets away with the motionless body of the King. After a short bloody battle Axel, Tara and Karo are standing alone in the throne room of the King looking out of the scattered window where they can see the shape of the gargoyle vanishing in the horizon.
