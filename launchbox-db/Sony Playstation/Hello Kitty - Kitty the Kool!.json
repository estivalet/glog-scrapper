{"altername_name": ["Kitty the Kool! Kabuki de Tanoshiku Odotte Ne!!"], "name": "Hello Kitty: Kitty the Kool!", "overview": "Kitty the Kool which stars one of the world's most endearing and beloved characters an like the other dancing games that have preceded it, you have to dance good. Kitty and her Sanrio pals come to the stage with kimono garb and swing to music that sounds sort of like Kabuki theater mixes. The controls are simple and the game allows the player to set the tempo of the music so that choreography is a snap. Fun and cute beyond compare. Kitty wants to become a star of the dance, and with this intention, it must play in front of a crowd which does not cease growing with every new level. Other characters of Sanrio are there to help it: Badztmaru (its agent), Monkichi (the DJ), Pochacco (the beater), Keroppi, Pokopon and so on. The sequences of keys are not fixed and each one can create its own choreography but the player can't repeat the same movement twice: For example you can do up, down, left or right but not repeat up twice. You just have to respect the tempo indicated in the bottom of the screen.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "November 26, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Imageneer", "publishers": "Imageneer", "genres": "Music", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109809-hello-kitty-kitty-the-kool\n"}
