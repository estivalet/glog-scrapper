{"altername_name": ["Darkstalkers 3: Jedah's Damnation", "Vampire Saviour EX Edition"], "name": "Darkstalkers 3", "overview": "This is the 3rd in the Darkstalkers series (the 2nd, Night Warriors: Darkstalkers' Revenge, was published only for the Sega Saturn in the US.) It plays much the same as the first, but features better animation, more playable characters, and a deeper storyline. Jedah, the \"Lord of Vampire\", has summoned all of the Night Warriors to his realm to be assimilated into his being. Of course, this serves as a great excuse to have more one-on-one fights... Play as Jedah, B. B. Hood, Q-Bee, Lilith, Demitri, Morrigan, Anakaris, Victor, L. Raptor, Hsien-Ko, J. Talbain, Felicia, Rikuo, Sasquatch, Bishamon, Donovan, Pyron or Huitzil, and conquer the enemy.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "November 18, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Capcom", "publishers": "Capcom", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.94", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darkstalkers_3", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NScE52Yvj1s", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/11107-darkstalkers-3\n"}
