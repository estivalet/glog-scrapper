{"altername_name": [], "name": "Taiyou no Shippo: Wild, Pure, Simple Life", "overview": "In Tail of the Sun, you are a caveman in prehistoric times. Your mission: to build an ivory tower of mammoth tusks tall enough to reach the tail of the sun. You are to develop your caveman tribe by hunting, swimming, running, climbing, and taking on other activities to raise your physical or mental attributes. You must venture off into a vast, untamed world to explore harsh terrains that consist of deserts, caves, forests, and ocean floors. The player's ultimate objective is to build a tower of mammoth tusks that reaches the sun. To this end, he or she must gather enough food for the tribe to thrive and multiply, while exploring a large map full of various creatures and oddities. The game was re-released in Japan on PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable as a PSOne Classic in 2006 When the game begins, it drops the player off at his home village with no goals, objectives, or guidance. The protagonist is free, from the outset, to go nearly anywhere and do basically anything. The landscape the player character inhabits is not only shared by a variety of polygonal fauna, but by flora rendered in the form of Mochi of various shapes and colors, which have varying effects on one's health and various stats. While exploring the fairly vast landscape, the player's character will need to sleep, and will often choose to do so while in the middle of hunting or swimming. One notable difference between the Japanese and North American releases of the game is that the latter allows the player to wake his or her caveman up when this occurs. STORY: The world is quiet... Waiting to be filled. Slowly, the planet began to show vast transformations. Giant rains filled oceans in. Eventually, life sprang up. As time went by, more and more life began to appear, even plant life. Along with all these animals came the rise of one being in particular... HUMAN! Human started as a small group. Human seemed to have a vast reasoning and social intelligence. Out of the humans, one was picked to become their leader and main hunter. That one did most of the hunting and gathering. As human minds grew, so did human desire and ambition. They looked ot the sky and noticed all the time that there was something up there. It looked as though it were burning and wouldn't stop. It was The Sun. The humans began a new course in life. They wanted to seek out a good enough resource to build a gigantic tower so that they could catch what they thought was the Tail of the Sun. They found the best resource to do this with was the tusks of a huge mammal called the mammoth. This was an immensely powerful beast that could only be killed by the most powerful weapons and the most skilled hunters. So, in order to fulfill their desire, the humans pulled together to find a way to kill this creature effectively and make their way to the Tail of the Sun. However, first thing's first. They've got to get their population and culture booming and under control.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "April 26, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "ArtDink", "publishers": "ArtDink", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/112853-taiyou-no-shippo-wild-pure-simple-life\n"}
