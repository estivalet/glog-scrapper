{"altername_name": ["Command & Conquer: Der Tiberiumkonflikt", "Command & Conquer: Teil 1: Der Tiberiumkonflikt", "Command & Conquer Complete"], "name": "Command & Conquer", "overview": "Command & Conquer develops ideas from Westwood's previous game Dune 2, forming a real-time strategy (RTS) game. The control system involves selecting units with the mouse and then directing them, while the opponents make their moves without waiting for a \"turn\" to end. The game focuses on a war between two organizations, The Brotherhood of Nod and the Global Defense Initiative. The player can take control of either side for more than 15 missions. Both have different units and structures, including artillery, tanks and light infantry.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "December 1, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Westwood Studios", "publishers": "Virgin Interactive Entertainment", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.09", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_%26_Conquer_%281995_video_game%29", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYOH9dNgT1k", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/11146-command-conquer\n"}
