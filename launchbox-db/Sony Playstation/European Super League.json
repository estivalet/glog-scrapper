{"altername_name": [], "name": "European Super League", "overview": "It hasn\u2019t happened yet but Virgin Interactive have taken the plunge and gone for fully licensed team and stadium endorsements glory. Scots will not be happy with VIE\u2019s choice of teams for this title however, as neither of the Glasgow giants has been included in the game. Fact is, there are just 16 teams in European Super League and that\u2019s your lot. No hidden teams or players, none that we\u2019ve been able to find anyhow, and very little in the way of frills. European Super League does have the aforementioned licenses teams and endorsements with recognisable company names, and it has to be said, the stadiums look wonderful. The attention to detail is spot-on and the crowd\u2019s chanting and general level of noise boosts the atmosphere nicely. Sadly the gameplay is only average. European Super League should have followed its real-life incarnation\u2019s example. That is, it should have been thought through a little more than it obviously has before being brought to the table.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "March 2, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Virgin Interactive Entertainment", "publishers": "Virgin Interactive Entertainment", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.7", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/94928-european-super-league\n"}
