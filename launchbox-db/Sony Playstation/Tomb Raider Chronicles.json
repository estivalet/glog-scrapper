{"altername_name": ["Tomb Raider: Die Chronik", "Tomb Raider V: Chronicles", "Tomb Raider : Sur les traces de Lara Croft"], "name": "Tomb Raider Chronicles", "overview": "Picking up where Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation left off, Tomb Raider Chronicles begins at a memorial service for the intrepid heroine Lara Croft. While friends and family recollect her past adventures through full-motion video sequences, you'll guide Lara through four previously untold scenarios. These scenarios take place in the city of Rome, aboard a German U-Boat, from a remote island located in Ireland, and within a technologically advanced tower. You'll use the full-grown adventurer in addition to the 16-year-old introduced in The Last Revelation as you advance through the game. Levels highlight certain aspects of the Tomb Raider series. Rather than blasting enemy forces, the use of deception and puzzle solving is required on the Irish levels. Whereas the Rome levels are built upon exploration, the German U-Boat is crawling with baddies. Receiving instruction from a faithful companion named ZIP, the tower levels require stealth tactics and strategy.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "November 20, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Core Design", "publishers": "Eidos", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.18", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_Raider_Chronicles", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/13057-tomb-raider-chronicles\n"}
