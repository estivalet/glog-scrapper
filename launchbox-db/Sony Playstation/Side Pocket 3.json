{"altername_name": [], "name": "Side Pocket 3", "overview": "Side Pocket is a pocket billiards (pool) simulator video game originally released into arcade by Data East in 1986. Versions of the arcade original were developed for various platforms and two sequels to the game were produced. G-Mode currently owns the intellectual property rights to the Side Pocket series, and licenses these games globally. The unusual single player mode, called \"pocket\", requires that the player clear all the balls off the table in a limited number of shots, as well as achieve a predetermined score. The player earns points by sinking balls, sinking balls on consecutive shots, and sinking balls in numerical order. On occasion, a pocket will light up, and if the player sinks a ball into that pocket on that shot, a bonus will be earned in the form of points or extra shots. In the two-player \"pocket\" mode, the game plays similarly, except the two players take turns; if one player does not pocket a ball or scratches, control of the ball changes to the other player. The game had three sequels, Minnesota Fats: Pool Legend (released as Side Pocket 2 outside the United States) in 1992 for the Sega Genesis, Side Pocket 2 for the Sega Saturn, and Side Pocket 3 for the Sega Saturn and original PlayStation.
