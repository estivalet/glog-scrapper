You have a wide selection of tracks and cars, along with options for multiplayer gaming and a vast array of configuration options. Cars can drive up walls, flip over, and continue driving. This makes for a very quick and fluid gameplay unlike any other at the time of this game's release.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "March 31, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Attention to Detail", "publishers": "Psygnosis", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.58", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rollcage_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5_YsGMYjAk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/8580-rollcage\n"}
