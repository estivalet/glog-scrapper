{"altername_name": [], "name": "Power Play: Sports Trivia", "overview": "POWER PLAY: Sports Trivia tests the knowledge of up to four players in hockey, baseball, basketball, football, or all four areas. Once a sport is selected, players can elect to play a Tournament Game or Last Man Standing. Tournament consists of a series of ten increasingly difficult multiple-choice questions worth 100, 200, or 300 points apiece. Players who continually answer correctly after buzzing in will receive a \"streak\" multiplier in addition to points, but an incorrect answer deducts points from their total score. The person with the most points at the end of the game wins, receiving an overall ranking as well as a possible Hall of Fame induction after achieving a high score. Last Man Standing follows the same structure but with a finite number of allowable misses, the default being five. Once this number is reached, the next player in line continues until only one remains. Both trivia contests conclude with a gold, silver, and bronze medal ceremony based on overall points. High scores, rankings, and question progress (from the pool of 4,000) are then saved to memory card.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "May 15, 2002", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Starsphere Interactive", "publishers": "Ubi Soft Entertainment Software", "genres": "Quiz", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.8", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/84106-power-play-sports-trivia\n"}
