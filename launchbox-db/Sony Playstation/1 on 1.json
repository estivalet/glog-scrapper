The story revolves around a basketball team from Earth assembled to participate in an intergalactic basketball competition. The web comic is released in four languages. 1 on 1 is, like the name suggests, a 1 on 1 basketball game with characters designed by Buzzer Beater's Inoue Takehiko, the game is played on half court with one basket only. The game is played over two rounds or until one of the contenders reaches 11 points. The players take turns being on the offense and the defense. If the player on defense successfully steals the ball from the offense player, they switch positions. The game itself is in full 3D, but the controls are more similar to a 2D game with no \"depth\" to the movement. There is a selection of 8 different characters to pick from, each with their own special abilities and distinct looks.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "November 26, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jorudan", "publishers": "Jorudan", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.43", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/91595-1-on-1\n"}
