This side-scrolling platformer is presented in a graphical style designed to match the beloved series of United Artists cartoons. Players guide the Pink Panther though a variety of dangerous environments. He'll have to keep his classic cool as he faces dangers of game levels such as the Stone Age, the Gangster's Hide-Out, and Dracula's Castle. Many zany objects and gadgets can be found along the way to help you reach your objectives. You'll be using lampshades, paint, fire extinguishers, magnets and even bowling balls. Disguise yourself, blend into the background, disarm traps and fight off enemies.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "January 4, 2003", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "\u00c9tranges Libellules", "publishers": "DreamCatcher Interactive", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.14", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/48520-pink-panther-pinkadelic-pursuit\n"}
