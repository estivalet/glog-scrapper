It is a theme park management game where players build their own theme park with roller coasters, rides and food stalls. Each building can be customized for its appearance, prices and also the length of the ride. Roller coasters play an important role as the main attraction for visitors. Players can design a custom ride and then test it from a first-person view. In this version the park can be built in four different worlds: Lost Kingdom (prehistoric theme), Halloween World (spooky theme), Wonderland (fantasy theme) and Space Zone (futuristic theme). The game boasts 3D graphics and players can walk around in their park as if they were one of the guests, and go on the rides. Golden Tickets can be won by doing great things to the park and these can be used to buy new rides and parks.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "March 21, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "The Climax Group", "publishers": "Electronic Arts, Inc.", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.38", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83373-sim-theme-park\n"}
