{"altername_name": ["Gex: Deep Cover Gecko"], "name": "Gex 3: Deep Cover Gecko", "overview": "When Gex is watching TV one day, he discovers that Rez has kidnapped Agent Xtra (the agent from Gex: Enter the Gecko's backstory), head of the TV Terrorist Defense Unit, to get to him. He teleports to the batcave-like lair he has in the Media Dimension, and begins another adventure. Each level parodies a certain aspect of television culture (here the levels exist as stand-alone channels). Gex enters each level through a television set. He must collect remote controls to advance to the next level in order to complete his mission and rescue Xtra.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "March 23, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Crystal Dynamics", "publishers": "Eidos Interactive", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.04", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gex_3:_Deep_Cover_Gecko", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Spp2vjx8aIQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/9062-gex-3-deep-cover-gecko\n"}
