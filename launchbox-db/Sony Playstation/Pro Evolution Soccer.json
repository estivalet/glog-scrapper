The player also has a large array of options. The player can play single matches as well as league or cup tournaments, and there is also a training mode. There are 5 difficulty levels, different weather conditions, and injuries are optional, as are extra time and penalty shoot-outs. Players can be designed with a range of physical and mental attributes, as well as different appearances. Gameplay is not as end-to-end as the contemporary FIFA titles, and finishing is more of a matter of precise timing and skill. Players and officials make mistakes on occasion as well.
