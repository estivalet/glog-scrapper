{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Next Tetris", "overview": "The Next Tetris is not only based on the original Tetris, which was created by Russian designer Alexey Pajitnov back in the mid- to late-1980s, it actually includes a copy of the original game, complete with enhanced graphics and sound. As most people know, Tetris is a game in which you maneuver falling blocks of seven different shapes into unbroken horizontal lines. When a line is created, the blocks in that line (or lines) disappear from the screen. Your job is to keep the pile of blocks from reaching the top of the playfield. The Next Tetris mode of play introduces several new elements to the Tetris universe. The block-maneuvering action remains, but special multi-colored puzzle pieces that can separate and fall when they land enter the mix. Also, blocks above cleared lines will fall to spaces below, possibly setting up a chain reaction, which in this game is called a Cascade.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "May 31, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Blue Planet Interactive", "publishers": "Atari", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.23", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkykYIYVpk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/557-the-next-tetris\n"}
