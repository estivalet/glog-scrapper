{"altername_name": [], "name": "Perfect Performer: The Yellow Monkey", "overview": "The Yellow Monkey, often abbreviated to yemon, is a popular Japanese rock band formed in 1989. Its name derives from an ethnic slur and is an ironic reference to the belief that Japanese rock groups could never be \"authentic\". In 2003, HMV Records Japan rated them #81 in their \"Top 100 Japanese pops Artists\". Although band activities were ceased starting from January 2001, except for later releases of band material such as compilations and DVDs, The Yellow Monkey actually broke up on July 7, 2004. Perfect Performer The Yellow Monkey is a Rhythm Action game featuring songs from JRock band The Yellow Monkey. It supports up to four players at once each playing a different instrument ala a primitive version of Rockband minus the specialty controllers. You can do Vocals, Guitar, Bass and Drums. Regardless of the instrument all are the same as far as gameplay is concerned. You have to tap the various face buttons as they scroll from right to left. Each instrument has it's own unique notechart.
