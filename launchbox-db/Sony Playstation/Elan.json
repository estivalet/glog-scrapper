{"altername_name": [], "name": "Elan", "overview": "150 years ago there was a nuclear war on Earth and a colony of humans escape from Earth to the space where they were forced to live since them. But the people wanted to live on a planet but they didn't find a proper one, until they find \u00c9lan. After discover the new planet they choose a team to evaluate 9 candidates to choose 2 of them to travel to the \u00c9lan planet and see if it can be colonizated. Those candidates have to pass some rigurous training before those 2 of them will be chosen, but instead of that training they will also have to learn to communicate between them. so communication is the key. The player's character (that can be a male or a female one) got 3 different kind of feelings (happy, angry and normal or sad). The combination of the emotional feelings and the answers in his communications with the other candidates will make them better or worse possible partners and the conversations will also change the character feelings. The training part is about using different machines to improve the players stats: Running, Strength, Computer, Communications, Pilot mechas, virtual reality, flight simulator and gravity simulator. With those two stats (the training and the conversations) the player's character will grow in a way or another one, and his relations with others candidates will be different too. The game ending will depend of the character stats, the result of the final exam and his relationships with the other candidates. So there are different game endings.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "April 1, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Visco", "publishers": "Visco", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/108219-elan\n"}
