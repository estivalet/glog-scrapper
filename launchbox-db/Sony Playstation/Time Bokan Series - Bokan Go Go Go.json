{"altername_name": ["Time Bokan Series - Bokan GoGoGo"], "name": "Time Bokan Series: Bokan Go Go Go", "overview": "Time Bokan is a Japanese anime series first aired on Fuji TV from October 4, 1975 to December 25, 1976 throughout Japan every Saturday at 6:30pm, with a total of 61 30-minute episodes. It was produced by Tatsunoko Productions, who later produced a number of spinoff programs as part of the \"Time Bokan Series\": Dr. Kieda, a somewhat slightly wacky, but intelligent scientist, has finally succeeded in inventing insect-shaped all-terrain time machines called \"Time Bokan\". To prove its efficiency and safety, he decides to serve as the very first guinea-pig for its maiden voyage. However, by the time the machine returned, he isn't anywhere inside. The only thing that returned with it is a talking parrot, along with a large gemstone called the Dynamond, which is seemingly the most powerful and valuable jewel in the world. Now it is up to a search party, founded by Dr. Kieda's lab assistant Tanpei, to travel though time to find Dr. Kieda; but it seems that someone power hungry is looking for the \"Dynamond\"... Based on the bizarre Bokan series with its plethora of psychotic pigs, this is a wacky racing title with weapons to slow the leader down and opponents that ensure you won't know if you'll be finishing first or last until you see the checkered flag. Plenty of mad movie clips from the anime series and gameplay is kept balanced by scoring more points for finishing last, thus allowing bigger spending on upgrades.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "February 22, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Banpresto", "publishers": "Banpresto", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/82131-time-bokan-series-bokan-go-go-go\n"}
