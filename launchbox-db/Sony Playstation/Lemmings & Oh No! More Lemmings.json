{"altername_name": [], "name": "Lemmings & Oh No! More Lemmings", "overview": "Lemmings, Lemmings and Oh No! More Lemmings! It's your duty to train these mindless suicidal creatures to perform tasks that will carry them to safety. Without you, they'd walk into their ultimate demise! As a compilation of sorts, Psygnosis has ported the original Lemmings to the PlayStation along with the Oh No! More Lemmings companion. In either puzzle game, you'll assign different skills to individual lemmings; skills are assigned in coordination with the challenges the little critters face. Sometimes you'll need to build stairs and assign roadblocks to cross and avoid a large pit; there are instances when you'll have the lemmings climbing walls and digging in the ground. You can also bash through walls, assign bombers and float in the air. With the lives of many lemmings at your fingertips, use your powers wisely.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "October 10, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Psygnosis", "publishers": "Sony Computer Entertainment Europe", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.87", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/17264-lemmings-oh-no-more-lemmings\n"}
