{"altername_name": [], "name": "NFL Blitz", "overview": "From the creators of NBA Jam, NFL Blitz provides football fans with a new way to play their favorite sport. Tired of a measly 10 yards needed for a first down? This game requires 30. Think 11 men per side is too many? Try a seven-on-seven match-up. Hate yelling at the stupid referees? They're gone. In fact, such unsportsmanlike acts as late hits and pass interference are actually encouraged in this game -- anything to keep the other team from scoring. Along with the bone-crunching hits comes an accelerated pace as your real NFL players on their 1998 teams turn on their Turbo meters and play with superhuman abilities. There are three different play modes in NFL Blitz. In \"Arcade\" mode, your objective is to defeat all of the NFL's 30 teams as you take on either the computer or a friend. \"Season Play\" mode allows you to guide your favorite team through an NFL season on its way to the Super Bowl. Besides the standings, stats are also featured in this mode. Finally, \"Tournament Play\" mode involves three to eight players in a single elimination tournament to see who is best. Features: Block and run the field alone or challenge friends to a \"tackle fest\" Use the no referee standard to execute illegal moves and plays Slay the enemies in your way as you complete mandatory puzzles and objectives", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "September 10, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Midway", "publishers": "SCEA", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.82", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/33148-nfl-blitz\n"}
