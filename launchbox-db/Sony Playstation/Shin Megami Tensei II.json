{"altername_name": [], "name": "Shin Megami Tensei II", "overview": "Following the remake of the first Shin Megami Tensei, this is a re-vamped version of the second game, originally released for the Super Famicom (SNES). Like the first remake, the graphics of the game have been redone from scratch, to match the 2D standard of 32-bit generation consoles. Interior locations are much more detailed, with visible furniture and other items in rooms that were empty in the original version. The 3D dungeons can now be navigated with smooth scrolling, unlike the \"jumping\" navigation of the earlier versions. The remake also has an additional difficulty level, dubbed \"normal\"; the original difficulty level is called \"hard\". The easier difficulty level also reduces the amount of random battles. Story, dialogues, layout of locations, and general gameplay remain unchanged in this version.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "March 20, 2002", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Atlus", "publishers": "Atlus", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.8", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Megami_Tensei_II", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/79052-shin-megami-tensei-ii\n"}
