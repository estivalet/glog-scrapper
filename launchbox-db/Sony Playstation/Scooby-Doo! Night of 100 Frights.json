{"altername_name": [], "name": "Scooby-Doo! Night of 100 Frights", "overview": "The PS1 Scooby-Doo!: Night of 100 Frights has almost nothing in common with the game eventually released for next-gen consoles. It has level concepts that share similarities to that game, but nothing concrete apart from the name and developer. A build dated October 26, 2000 was released on May 29, 2021. Only five levels are playable, though more were evidently planned given that the cutscenes feature locations not in the game.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "", "developers": "Heavy Iron Studios", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/373451-scooby-doo-night-of-100-frights\n"}
