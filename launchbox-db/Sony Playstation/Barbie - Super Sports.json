It's two games in one for twice the fun!

And you'll need better equipment if you want to beat Barbie and her friends. After beating the computer-controlled opponents, challenge your friends to a race with the Two-Player mode, or see who can complete a course the fastest in the Time-Trial mode. Whether it is snowboarding or in-line skating, with Barbie anything is possible.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "December 30, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Runecraft", "publishers": "Mattel", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.46", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbie_Super_Sports", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/32672-barbie-super-sports\n"}
