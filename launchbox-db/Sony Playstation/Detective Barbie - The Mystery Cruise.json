{"altername_name": ["Barbie: Detective: The Mystery Cruise"], "name": "Detective Barbie: The Mystery Cruise", "overview": "Players have the chance to join \"Team Barbie Detective\" in Mattel Interactive's Detective Barbie: The Mystery Cruise. Like the earlier PC releases Detective Barbie and Detective Barbie 2, this game is a mystery adventure designed for girls (and mystery-loving sleuths of all ages). Unlike its predecessors, however, Detective Barbie: The Mystery Cruise was designed specifically for the PlayStation console. The game supports two players who are encouraged to explore a large cruise ship and three tropical ports-of-call in search of clues that will help solve the mystery of some valuable missing artwork. Luckily, players will find many vehicles and gadgets in Detective Barbie: The Mystery Cruise to help them along the way.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "November 28, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Runecraft", "publishers": "Mattel", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.39", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/12364-detective-barbie-the-mystery-cruise\n"}
