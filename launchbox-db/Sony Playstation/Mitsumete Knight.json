{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mitsumete Knight", "overview": "Mitsumete Knight is a dating simulation game produced inconjunction by Konami and Red Company (of Sakura Wars fame, and now named Red Entertainment). It was released in 1997 for the PlayStation. The characters of the game was designed by Takenami Hideyuki who had previously taken part in designs for Sakura Taisen, and specifically, enemy designs for Sakura Taisen 2. The game itself was modified from Tokimeki Memorial: Forever with You, with improvements including an expanded area to display backgrounds and larger characters. It should be noted however that the gameplay between the two series varies in many areas. The player is a mercenary from the east travelling to the kingdom of Dolphan, modelled after middle-ages Europe. He had been hired to aid the war fought by the country, which will last throughout the following three years of the game, where the player will meet a number of the different characters and develop a relationship with them. At the end of the third year and the end of the war, Dolphan issues an order for all foreigners within the country boarders to be expelled, marking a sudden departure for the player. If the player had developed a fruitful relationship with one of the girls, they will meet the player and leave the country with him (with exceptions to certain characters). Many of the characters die throughout the course of the story, even some of the main characters, and is highly dependent on the actions of the player. Such is quite uncommon for a dating simulation game.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "March 19, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Life Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/112957-mitsumete-knight\n"}
