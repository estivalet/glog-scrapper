{"altername_name": ["Snow Break"], "name": "Extreme Snow Break", "overview": "Extreme Snow Break is a ski racing game that features four types of races: - The arcade mode is one-player race, against three other skiers. - The two-player mode you race against a ghost of the other competitor rather than play at the same time. - That leaves the two time modes. Trial is like the one-player game but against the clock rather than other blokes, while the time race is against a ghost of your best course times. This game is known in Japan as Snow Break", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "March 10, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Virtual Studio", "publishers": "Microids", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.31", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/95311-extreme-snow-break\n"}
