{"altername_name": ["Firestorm: Thunderhawk 2"], "name": "Thunderhawk 2: Firestorm", "overview": "This is the sequel to Core's Sega CD game, AH-3 Thunderstrike. Like the previous game in the series, this is a helicopter simulator/shooter. It features realistic features like multiple weapons selection, full freedom of movement, and a mission-based structure. On the other hand, it also throws lots and lots of enemy tanks and helicopters at you to blow up. The graphics in Thunderstrike 2 are drawn completely with 3D polygons, including the helicopter's cockpit. As you track an enemy, the view changes so that it is always in your sights. There are 8 campaigns to complete, each with multiple missions.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "December 10, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Core Design", "publishers": "Core Design", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/17286-thunderhawk-2-firestorm\n"}
