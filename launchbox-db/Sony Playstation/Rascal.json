{"altername_name": ["Bubblegun Kid"], "name": "Rascal", "overview": "Put on your baggy pants, grab your shades, and turn your hat backwards -- its time to save the world, baby! Assuming the role of a mischievous dude with a 'tude, Rascal's mission is to save his brainiac grandfather from the clutches of Chronon. Casper Clockwise is well versed in the fields of sciences, inventions and time travelling. With that information, the evil overlord Chronon is hatching diabolical schemes to destroy the events of the past. Armed with the one-of-a-kind Bubble Gun, Rascal will travel through time to thwart the evil minion's plans and rescue his grandfather. As a third-person 3D platformer, players will traverse through ancient Mayan ruins, Old Western settings, and the Lost City of Atlantis; there are six worlds broken into 18 levels apiece, each crammed with hidden areas and bonus goodies! Along the way, Rascal will encounter hordes of bad guys specific to the current location. Ranging from peg-legged pirates and mermaids to crazy sheriffs and their deputies, players are required to make good use of the Bubble Gun. Additionally, each level is filled with platforming hazards that will have our hero swimming through dangerous waters, outrunning monsters, and jumping between moving and static platforms.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "March 31, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Traveller's Tales", "publishers": "Psygnosis", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.54", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/11354-rascal\n"}
