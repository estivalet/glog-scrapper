The gameplay is simple: The player have to join more than 3 puzzle pieces of the same colour to make them dissapear and that way it will send them to his opponent. There are also stoney faced blocks that can't be destroyed so its best to concentrate. When the opponent or the player pieces reaches the top the match ends. The game features different female characters to choose and different game mode and difficulty modes. And there is also a funny mode in which the characters instead of girls are animals, ninjas & monsters.
