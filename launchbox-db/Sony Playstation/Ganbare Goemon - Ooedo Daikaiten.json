{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ganbare Goemon: Ooedo Daikaiten", "overview": "Ganbare Goemon: \u014cedo Daikaiten is a Ganbare Goemon game released for the PlayStation on March 29, 2001. A villain named Ecorori kidnaps Omitsu, and it's up to Goemon and his crew to stop him. The game is extremely similar to Ganbare Goemon 2 for Super Famicom and Goemon's Great Adventure/Mystical Ninja 2 in that there's mostly sidescrolling levels, accompanied by some Impact bosses. Unlike previous Goemon games, which have used sprites or 3-D models for the characters, the characters are now represented by pre-rendered CGI, giving them a quasi-3-D look. Also, Yae is featured in her outfit that first appeared in Mononoke Suguroku.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "March 29, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.07", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/24826-ganbare-goemon-ooedo-daikaiten\n"}
