{"altername_name": [], "name": "SD Gundam Over Galaxian", "overview": "The game is a sort of a retelling of the 0079 story with battles that play like a game of galaxian! There are different viewpoints that can be switched on the fly to any angle (from arcade-style to first-person, which gives you an optional gunsight), there are a couple of 2-player modes, and you get a separate sd g charger game on the same disc which plays the same as the main game. SD Gundam: Over Galaxian is a semi-3D update of Namco's arcade classic Galaxian featuring the famous SD Gundam characters. The game plays pretty much the same as the original Galaxian, though there some added features such as a variety of power-ups. The game includes two different story modes (Gundam Story and G Changer Story), a remixed version of the original Galaxian, and a two-player VS mode. CG videos explain the story as you progress through the game.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "June 28, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Lay-Up", "publishers": "Bandai", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/112268-sd-gundam-over-galaxian\n"}
