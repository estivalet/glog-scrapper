{"altername_name": [], "name": "Shake Kids", "overview": "Shake Kids is a game similar to Klonoa released in 1998 in which you control one character that can be a boy named Randy or a girl called Nihni. Mr. Shaker, a divine kind of shaking god teaches you the way of the shake. By throwing your shaker at enemies, you can destroy them, but just throwing the shaker isn't enough to defeat all your enemies. When enemies are struck by the shaker, they momentarily get dizzy and during this time, you can initiate a jam session where you suck up any dazed foes in the area and you get your groove on. As the title suggests, you are kids that shake stuff up and you must hit the L and R buttons to shake your shaker in different directions.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "July 16, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Digital Kids", "publishers": "On Demand", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=672s4F_pSS0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/126931-shake-kids\n"}
