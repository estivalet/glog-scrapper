{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4", "overview": "The fourth game in Activision and Neversoft's seminal skateboarding series is designed to bring additions and refinements to the already polished gameplay that's made Tony Hawk's Pro Skater one of the most important video game franchises of its time. Many of these improvements are in line with advances made in earlier THPS sequels, while others may come as a surprise to longtime fans of the series. Environments are designed to seem even larger and more interactive in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4, with less worry over time limits and more emphasis on exploration. The game also adds new tricks to the pro skaters' repertoires, allowing huge, point-packed combos. The \"spine transfer\" challenges skaters to zip up one side of a double ramp and down the other. Players will trick off of moving cars and other interactive elements of the game's diverse levels with new finesse.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "October 23, 2002", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Vicarious Visions", "publishers": "Activision", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.72", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHcpLwKq900", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/11239-tony-hawks-pro-skater-4\n"}
