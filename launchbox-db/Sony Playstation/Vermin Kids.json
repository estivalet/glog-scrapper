{"altername_name": [], "name": "Vermin Kids", "overview": "Vermin Kids is a mix between Space Invaders and a puzzle game. In this game the player have to destroy aliens joining some of them with the same colour in the same line or lines. To do that he can rotate his bullets to find the proper colour to fire. When you fire an alien with a colour he turns to that colour and if he is near others with that colour they are eliminated. The game features different roads to reach the final levels, so the game can be playable more than once to be fully completed. There are 10 different stages (4 rounds playable only in the same game) and 4 final levels. The game features different game modes (normal, vs, cooperative, and 4 players vs mode) and even an edit mode to create new levels.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "November 1, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nexton", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/95843-vermin-kids\n"}
