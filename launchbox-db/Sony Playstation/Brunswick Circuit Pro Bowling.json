{"altername_name": [], "name": "Brunswick Circuit Pro Bowling", "overview": "Brunswick Circuit Pro Bowling is a faithful recreation of the professional alley-going experience. Pick from six modes of play, including practice, skins (i.e., bowling for dollars), exhibition, tournament, career, and the Las Vegas-based, glow-in-the-dark cosmic bowl. Assuming the role of one of seven pro bowlers, each with unique playing characteristics, players compete using Brunswick Circuit Pro Bowler rules, equipment, and lanes (14 in all). Though you can't design your shoes' color scheme, a create-a-bowler feature allows players to customize appearance and general playing characteristics. To recreate a realistic bowling experience, ball and pin physics are like the real thing and intuitive controls, closely resembling golf game setups, allow players to control launch speed and influence hooks and rolls. Avid fans can host virtual leagues with the game's six-player multiplayer mode.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "September 28, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Adrenalin Entertainment", "publishers": "THQ", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.79", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunswick_Circuit_Pro_Bowling", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72745-brunswick-circuit-pro-bowling\n"}
