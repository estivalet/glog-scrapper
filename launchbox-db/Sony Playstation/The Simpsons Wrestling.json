{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Simpsons Wrestling", "overview": "The Simpsons Wrestling features two gameplay options: Tournament and Grudge Match modes. The Tournament mode is a heated single-player competition against computer-controlled opponents. By defeating the opposition, you'll be crowned the best wrestler in Springfield and unlock secret characters and locations! The two-player Grudge Match is a no-frills brawl for it all...or at least bragging rights as to who is the better wrestler. Finally, FOX Interactive has included over 240 pieces of actual voice-acted audio samples and crude wrestling taunts! Needless to say, you'll be able to see and hear Bart Simpson in all his glory after defeating any given opponent. The game is also compatible with analog controls, the Dual Shock Analog Controller's vibration function, and a memory card for saving data. What are you waiting for?
