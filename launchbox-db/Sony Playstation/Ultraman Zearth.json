{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ultraman Zearth", "overview": "Ultraman Zearth is a parody Ultraman. He hails from The Land of Pikari in Nebula Z95. He has a big red face and dislikes dirt, and will go to great lengths to wash it off his hands. His goal is to clean the polluted Earth. He transforms with an electric toothbrush, which is consistent with his hygiene fixation. He's not quite adept at being a superhero, but at least he's trying. His human support group disguises itself as a gasoline stand, for which our hero is a janitor (again, consistent with his love of cleanliness). The Playstation game is a board game in which 5 different players will try to defeat a monster in each board to do that they will get more strenght advancing through the board.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "December 20, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Tohoku Shinsha", "publishers": "Tohoku Shinsha", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "5", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/136540-ultraman-zearth\n"}
