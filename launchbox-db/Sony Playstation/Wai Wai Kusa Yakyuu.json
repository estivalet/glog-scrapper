{"altername_name": [], "name": "Wai Wai Kusa Yakyuu", "overview": "Big League Slugger Baseball is a cartoonish, big-head-anime-style baseball game. It uses the standard behind-the-catcher viewpoint for batting and pitching and switches to different views when the ball is hit. One or two players can play a single exhibition game, or a single player can play a 10 or 30-game season, which can be saved to a memory card. After completing the season you can proceed to the Final Series. The game is unlicensed and does not include any real teams, players, or stadiums, though you can create your own players and teams. Take to the field in this pick-up-and-play version of the national pastime. PlayStation gamers can create their own ballplayer characters and baseball teams, and even choose a logo. Controls are designed to be straightforward and forgiving, with younger gamers in mind. Six different stadiums and other customization options are intended to keep baseball fans of all ages coming back to try new variations of play.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "March 20, 2003", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Hamster", "publishers": "Hamster", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/136041-wai-wai-kusa-yakyuu\n"}
