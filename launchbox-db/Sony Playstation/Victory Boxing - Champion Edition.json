As you progress, your fighter's skills, such as power, speed, and stamina, will increase. Your trainer Snake will provide tips on how to improve. Once you defeat the current champion two new characters will become playable in the two-player mode: Snake and a surprise character. Along with the championship mode players can also spar with a friend or try practice mode. Action can be viewed from 12 different angles and can also be replayed. During replays you can zoom in and out and change the camera angle.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "November 15, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Victor Interactive Software", "publishers": "Victor Interactive Software", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcH2wRvn8zA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78964-victory-boxing-champion-edition\n"}
