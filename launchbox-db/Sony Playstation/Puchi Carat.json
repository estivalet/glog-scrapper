{"altername_name": [], "name": "Puchi Carat", "overview": "Puchi Carat (known as Puchi Carat - Gemstone Ohkoku No Sekai in Japan) is a 1997 arcade game by Taito. The game is similar to Breakout (or Taito's own Arkanoid) in which the player uses a paddle to direct a ball and destroy gem-stones in order to either clean one's play-area of gems, or to destroy as many gems as possible to add to the amount of gems in the other player's field. The amount of gems increases every once in a while and if the gems reach the line at the bottom of the play-area, the player loses. It is also possible to drop groups of gems by destroying a gem that holds up the others. STORY: \"Dreams will come true if you collect the precious gems... The world of \"Gem Stone\" is where science and magic coexist. Legend tells of 12 precious gems for peace and prosperity, they believed that the gems made dreams come true.
