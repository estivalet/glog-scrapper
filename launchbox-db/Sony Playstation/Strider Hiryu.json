{"altername_name": ["Strider", "Strider"], "name": "Strider Hiryu", "overview": "The year is 2048 AD. In Russia, the evil Grand Master Meio has begun his insane plot to take over the universe. A lone figure drops from a stealth glider into Meio's base. He is Hiryu, Super A-Class Strider. His mission is to defeat the Grand Master and put an end to his plotting once and for all. Strider lets the protagonist run, jump, perform acrobatics and climb walls and overhangs. He wields a plasma sword, called a Cypher, through five levels fighting robots and guards, with mid- and end-level bosses. The PlayStation version of Strider was produced by Capcom and released in 2000 as a second disc that came packaged with the PlayStation version of Strider 2. The North American release has the Strider and Strider 2 game code pressed onto the wrong disc (so to play Strider you actually need to insert the Strider 2 disc).", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "October 24, 2006", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Capcom", "publishers": "Capcom", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.90", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strider_(arcade_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKSVzOks6aE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/11011-strider-hiryu\n"}
