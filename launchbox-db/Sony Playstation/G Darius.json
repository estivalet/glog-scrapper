Although the armed forces were badly ravaged, Amnelian scientists and engineers were able to make use of both A.N. and reverse engineered Thiiman technology/life systems to create the Silver Hawk fighters. Ultimately, two pilots\u2014Sameluck Raida and Lutia Feen\u2014are chosen to perform a decisive attack on the main Thiima base: Kazumn, a satellite of the planet Darius.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "March 31, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Taito", "publishers": "THQ", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.31", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-Darius", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zAQ54ip5UM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/11189-g-darius\n"}
