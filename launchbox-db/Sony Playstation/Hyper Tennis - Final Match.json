{"altername_name": ["Hyper Final Match Tennis"], "name": "Hyper Tennis: Final Match", "overview": "Hear the grunts echo through the stadium as you control one of 12 (6 male & 6 female) tennis players with different abilities. Up to four players can compete in Exhibition singles and doubles or rack up points on a World Tour of six tournaments (the Australian Open in Melbourne, the French Open in Paris, the Human Open in Tokyo, Mixed Doubles in Montreal, the US Open in New York and Wimbledon in London). Three different court surfaces (clay, grass, and hard court) affect the speed and bounce of balls hit. You get penalized for not connecting on your serve and must time your hits of returns as it will affect where the ball goes. Your player's movements are motion-captured and you can lunge at a ball if you are caught out of position. There's 9 different camera views to choose from.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "November 15, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Human Entertainment", "publishers": "JVC Digital Studios", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/93335-hyper-tennis-final-match\n"}
