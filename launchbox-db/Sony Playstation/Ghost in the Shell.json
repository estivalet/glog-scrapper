You take the role of a new member in Kusanagi's anti-terrorist squad and get to accomplish missions on your Fuchikoma, (a spider-like AI equipped tank) thanks to which you can jump, stick to walls and ceilings and shoot the hell out of terrorists, all from a 1st or 3rd person point of view. As the missions proceed a plot starts to surface concerning a giant skyscrapper, the Aereopolis II, which will eventually be solved after 12 single player missions. Other features include a training sequence, 3D stereo sound and wide anamorphic screen mode for 16x9 TVs.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "July 17, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Exact", "publishers": "Sony Computer Entertainment", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.04", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1499-ghost-in-the-shell\n"}
