{"altername_name": [], "name": "Baseball Navigator", "overview": "Where most baseball games have you controlling the players, Baseball Navigator is a little different in that it has you playing the part of a team manager. Set training schedules, draft and trade players, meet with the owner, and build the best team you can. During the games, you can act as the coach and give commands to your players. Coach your players well, and you'll have a winning team. You can even have your team play against a friend's team.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "July 31, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Angel", "publishers": "Angel", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/134945-baseball-navigator\n"}
