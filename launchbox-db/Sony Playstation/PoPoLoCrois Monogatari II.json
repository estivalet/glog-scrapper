{"altername_name": [], "name": "PoPoLoCrois Monogatari II", "overview": "Popolocrois II is actually the third game in a series of popular Japan playStation RPG called ''Popolocrois Monogatari'' (The Story of Popolocrois). Two years ago the prince of PoPoLoCrois, Pietoro, and his mother, Sanria, fought a great battle with the Ice Demon and his minions. Aided by his friends Narcia, the forest witch, the brave White Knight and the Gami Gami Devil Pietoro destroyed the evil Ice Demon and saved the land from and endless winter of despair. This also marked the first time Pietoro met his mother as her soul was previously trapped in the world of darkness and was only freed by the valiant efforts of Pietoro and his friends. And thus a time of peace and plenty came to the land of PoPoLoCrois. Pietoro has just turned twelve and his time to become a man is close at hand. Popolocrois II starts out with a very stereotypical-sounding quest to retrieve the ''crown of wisdom'' from a nearby cave but after that the game plot gets a lot more complicated and interesting.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "January 27, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "G-artists", "publishers": "Sony Computer Entertainment", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/48273-popolocrois-monogatari-ii\n"}
