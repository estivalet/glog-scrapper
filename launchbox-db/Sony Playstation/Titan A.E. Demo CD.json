{"altername_name": [], "name": "Titan A.E. Demo CD", "overview": "A video game adaptation of the movie Titan A.E. was in development by Blitz Games for PlayStation 1 and PC. The full game was cancelled largely due to the film's failed box office according to Fox Interactive. A playable demo of the game was released, with stunning visuals for a PlayStation game that supported Analog Control and the Vibration Function. It had similar gameplay to Tomb Raider, Atlantis The Lost Empire, and the Planet of the Apes video game. Cale Tucker would be the playable character. The game would also have Flight Simulator levels. The Demo CD had two playable third person exploration levels, and one flight simulator level. Video game hackers have managed to patch in 5 other playable levels in the CD, and have made \"Preservation Packs\" for PC and PlayStation, the intended platforms for the game.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "RP - Rating Pending", "developers": "Blitz Games", "publishers": "Fox Interactive", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.19", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/uDb7tDI6CHo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/136538-titan-ae-demo-cd\n"}
