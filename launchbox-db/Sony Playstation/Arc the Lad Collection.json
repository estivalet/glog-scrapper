The games were localized by Working Designs. Plans to localize the games had been fostered by Working Designs since the late 1990s, but the compilation was not released until 2002. The games form a trilogy with a continuous story throughout each. Although Arc is the primary protagonist, each game features a new lead character. Arc the Lad sets the stage for the next two games and follows Arc and Kukuru as they discover a plot to restore the Dark One. Arc the Lad II introduces Elc, a young Hunter that becomes tangled in the plot and eventually joins the battle against the Dark One. Arc the Lad III features Alec, a young Hunter with a mysterious past.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "April 18, 2002", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "G-Craft", "publishers": "Working Designs", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.61", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_the_Lad_Collection", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/11137-arc-the-lad-collection\n"}
