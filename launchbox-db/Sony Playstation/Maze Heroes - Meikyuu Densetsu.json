The gameaply is similar to a board game, the player roll a dice and advance to each board table until he can meet against the end level boss. The different part is that during the board he will fight against enemies depending of wich square he reachs and have to battle them. If the player defeats the ending level boss he will advance to the next level. The battles parts are in a first person perspective view meanwhile the board part is a isometric view.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "November 28, 2002", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Media Entertainment", "publishers": "Media Entertainment", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/110258-maze-heroes-meikyuu-densetsu\n"}
