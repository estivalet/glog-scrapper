{"altername_name": [], "name": "Simple 1500 Series Vol. 99: The Kendo: Ken no Hanamichi", "overview": "The Kendo is, like the title suggests, a kendo game in which you have the usual assortment of fighting game options (training mode, story mode, vs mode). You pick any of the eight characters (three at first, you unlock the rest as you progress) and face off against either a computer controlled opponent, against a friend or take on the story mode where you go from being an apprentice to becoming a kendo master. The gameplay is similar to any 1-on-1 fighting game, except that this one is devoid of any over the top special moves or crazy character. All characters are dressed in full kendo armor and your moves are restricted to traditional kendo moves with the bamboo sword. Each character has one harder attack, but otherwise they are all exactly the same in how they play. One clean hit is all it takes to win, so timing your attacking and blocking is important if you want to win. In each match you win if you get two points.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "August 29, 2002", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Amedio", "publishers": "D3Publisher", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/96704-simple-1500-series-vol-99-the-kendo-ken-no-hanamichi\n"}
