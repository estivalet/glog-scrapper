{"altername_name": [], "name": "NHL Powerplay 98", "overview": "NHL Powerplay 98 is a hockey game where the player can control a team of his choice to bring it to victory and glory. The game modes are the typical genre choices: Either a whole NHL season, the NHL playoffs or a league with 15 national teams. The team logos and player names are official licensed but in contrast to NHL 98 it uses the data from 1996/1997. The gameplay itself is more action oriented than a simulation and uses several shooting and pass variations which are activated with more or less complicated key combinations. Six camera angles and a instant replay feature complement the TV atmosphere. The game also features several tactical possibilities. For eight game situations the player can choose between three behaviours, e.g. how the players set up shots in the offensive zone. During the season there is a option to trade players with other teams. Extensive mid-season statistics, which can be shown for every team in the league, help planning transfers and tactics.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "August 31, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Radical Entertainment", "publishers": "Virgin Interactive Entertainment", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "8", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.12", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/77000-nhl-powerplay-98\n"}
