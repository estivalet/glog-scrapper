{"altername_name": ["G.O.D pure"], "name": "G.O.D Pure: Growth or Devolution", "overview": "G\u00b7O\u00b7D Pure is a remake of G.O.D: Mezameyo to Yobu Koe ga Kikoe. The story and the gameplay system remain the same; the changes in the remake mostly involve presentation. The game's graphical style remains rather faithful to the original in house interiors; however, cities and most dungeon-like areas have been re-designed as pre-rendered images. The perspective has become somewhat of a mix between the original top-down style and third-person perspective. Character graphics are very close to the original in style. A few pre-rendered movie sequences were added during some of the key events of narrative. CD-quality music has been re-recorded for this release.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "February 26, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Infinity", "publishers": "Imagineer", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/108247-god-pure-growth-or-devolution\n"}
