Players have to guide Tama, a ball shaped being, to the goal of several different labyrinths. Players guide Tama by tilting the entire labyrinth at all sorts of angles. The main obstacle going against the player is the timer that is always counting down. Players have to reach the goal before the time is up. Another goal for the player to aim for is to have a high score by beating the levels (referred to as waves in the game) as fast as possible.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "December 3, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Time Warner Interactive", "publishers": "Time Warner Interactive", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.17", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tama:_Adventurous_Ball_in_Giddy_Labyrinth", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/112863-tama-adventurous-ball-in-giddy-labyrinth\n"}
