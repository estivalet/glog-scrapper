In it, you are Miette who lives in an orphanage. The evil \"Siamese twins\" that run the orphanage have Miette steal stuff for them. But all of a sudden, some dark presence starts to steal the souls and dreams of the little children. Of course, it is up to Miette to save the day and get to the bottom of these events. Like the Alone in the Dark series, The City of Lost Children takes place in a 3D, 3rd person adventure world filled with lots of diverse and challenging puzzles, objects and people to interact with and a strict likeness (visually) to the movie.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "May 31, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Psygnosis", "publishers": "Psygnosis", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.12", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_City_of_Lost_Children_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/13096-the-city-of-lost-children\n"}
