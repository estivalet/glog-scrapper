While walking home in the rain from a party one night, the protagonist finds a girl sitting in the street. Homing in closer for a look, she has a cut on her head and is bleeding. Chivalry isn't dead when the player props the girl on his back and brings her home. Her name is Maria but she remembers nothing else about herself and why she was in the gutter. Originally released in 1998, the Yarudora (an abbreviation of Yaru Dorama which translates to \"Drama that You Do\") series of games all followed a central theme where a girl with amnesia enters the player's life. With the appearance of the girl, an interactive adventure follows where the story plays out in animated motion with choices to select along the way which affect the ultimate outcome. Features in the game include a graphics gallery, a replay function, and the ability to view various endings once they are achieved during a normal game. The game features 28 different endings (20 bad endings, 5 normal endings and 3 good endings) depending of the player choices during the game.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "October 15, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Production I.G.", "publishers": "Sony Computer Entertainment", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113299-yarudora-series-vol3-sampaguita\n"}
