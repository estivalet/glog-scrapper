Tomoya Mikami is a seventeen-year-old Japanese high school student attending the Sumisora Academy. The second year of his studies begins, and he boards the train that goes to the campus. On the way, however, Tomoya encounters Yue, a childhood friend who might have developed romantic feelings towards him. The matters become further complicated when Tomoya meets an attractive new transfer student, forcing him to sort out his preferences and abandon his usual cynical approach to love. Memories Off is a visual novel. Most of the game consists of text superimposed on still anime-style visuals. The interaction is restricted to occasional choices the player must make when prompted by the story development. Depending on these decisions the plot may advance into any of the six distinct branches, leading to different endings.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "September 30, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kid", "publishers": "KID", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161361-superlite-1500-series-memories-off\n"}
