{"altername_name": ["Total NBA '96", "Total NBA '96", "NBA Shoot Out"], "name": "NBA ShootOut", "overview": "Sony's first first-party basketball game, NBA Shootout features the league's 29 teams, each with authentic rosters (based on the 1995 season), stadiums and arenas, and uniforms. Ball players have been motion-captured to represent their in-game counterparts; on-screen NBA stars dribble, dish, drive, shoot, and dunk realistically. Spectacular moves can be viewed via the instant replay feature, just as in a live, televised game. With the team of their choice, players can choose to play single games or in an ongoing \"Season\" mode. Seasons can be either shortened or played in full length, and clubs can trade players with other teams. Players can save their modified teams, player rosters, and season progress to a PlayStation memory card. Another option allows players to play through the post-season playoffs, without having to play any regular-season games. In NBA Shootout's multiplayer modes up to eight human competitors (equipped with enough multi-tap controller accessories) can play at once, each controlling a different NBA player on the court. Features: Play alone or challenge friends to eight-player hard court action Listen to play-by-play from NBA announcer Dick Callahan Featuring all 29 NBA teams and over 300 NBA players including Kemp, Pippen, and Kidd", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "March 19, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Team SOHO", "publishers": "Sony", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.61", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_ShootOut", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzbtZqoSgSI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/48553-nba-shootout\n"}
