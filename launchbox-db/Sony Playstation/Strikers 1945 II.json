{"altername_name": ["SuperLite 1500 Series - Strikers 1945 II"], "name": "Strikers 1945 II", "overview": "Strikers 1945 II (\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30ab\u30fc\u30ba1945II) is a vertically-scrolling shoot 'em up game developed and originally published by Psikyo in 1997 for the arcades as a follow-up to Strikers 1945. This game was also ported by Kuusou Kagaku to the PlayStation and Sega Saturn for Psikyo and re-released by Success in 2000. As in Strikers 1945, the player chooses one of six World War II-era fighter planes, then uses machine guns and bombs to fight through eight stages (the first four stages being in random order and the latter four stages in linear fashion). Once the game is beaten, a report showing how well the player did is displayed, and the game 'loops' with the difficulty much higher. Each game begins with three lives, and an extend is earned at 600,000. When all lives are lost, the option to continue is given but the score is reset.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "October 22, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kuusou Kagaku", "publishers": "Psikyo", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.54", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikers_1945_II", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq8MTjAsz5w", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/110178-strikers-1945-ii\n"}
