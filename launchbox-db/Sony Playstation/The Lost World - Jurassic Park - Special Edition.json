{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Lost World: Jurassic Park: Special Edition", "overview": "The game was released for the Sony PlayStation under the Greatest Hits banner as The Lost World: Jurassic Park - Special Edition. Unlike most greatest hits releases this was not a straight repackaging of the original game. Instead the Special Edition featured several modifications to the gameplay designed to address concerns raised by critics on the games initial release. Several of the game's mechanics that were modified included the difficulty level with mid level checkpoints, stronger player characters, and the inclusion of level select codes in the manual. The Special Edition also featured an additional level that allowed players to play as the T. rex much earlier than before.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "September 23, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Dreamworks Interactive", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.71", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lost_World:_Jurassic_Park_(console_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73428-the-lost-world-jurassic-park-special-edition\n"}
