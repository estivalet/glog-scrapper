{"altername_name": ["Bust A Move 2: Dance Tengoku Mix", "Bust-A-Groove 2"], "name": "Bust A Groove 2", "overview": "BUST A GROOVE 2 continues the PlayStation dance party. Choose a dancer, each created using motion-captured technology and featuring new costumes. After picking a dancer, hit the dance floor in the Practice mode to get a feel for the controls. When practice is over, hit the dance scene in the One-Player mode, where the goal is to get the crowd and the camera to pay exclusive attention to you. How well you dance will determine what the next challenge will be. When your groove becomes too hot for the computer to handle, compete against friends with the Two-Player mode. No matter what mode you play, new ska, techno, disco, and hip-hop house beats provide the background for all of the action. If hearing music makes you want to shake your booty, then BUST A GROOVE 2 is the game for you.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "April 15, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Metro", "publishers": "Enix", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.52", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bust_a_Groove_2", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAhXraKNZkM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/11782-bust-a-groove-2\n"}
