{"altername_name": [], "name": "CyberTiger", "overview": "A step back from the Tiger Woods PGA's simulation style, Cyber Tiger Woods has more of an arcade feel to it, with cartoony-style animations, fast gameplay and elements added to make the game of golf more lively than the real-life counterpart. Although realistic elements are there, including full motion capture of Tiger Woods himself, recreations of five PGA tour courses, and the full range of moves (putting, chipping, driving, etc.), arcade elements \u2014such as 2-player battle mode, zany characters including Little Tiger, and game modes that have you aiming to knock down the opposing character from his platform above a pool of lava turn\u2014 are central to gameplay.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "September 30, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Electronic Arts", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.82", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CyberTiger", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxyXU8he-Iw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/9069-cybertiger\n"}
