{"altername_name": [], "name": "Martial Beat 2", "overview": "Martial Beat was a game created by Konami for the arcade and PlayStation in Japan in 2002. This game tests skill in martial arts, and it is not really considered part of Konami's Bemani series, even though it contains music from the series. This game was shipped in a modified Dance Dance Revolution cabinet, with the sensors and the game's art on it. Even though there is the presence of two sets of selection buttons (as Dance Dance Revolution supported two players), this game is one player only. To play the game, one needs to follow the on-screen instructor, and when a red light turns on located on top of the screen, the player must perform the move by repeating the instructor. Martial Beat 2 is the sequel to one of the newest form of dance simuation games. This game actually helps you keep fit by mixing martial arts and music together! You punk and kick to the beat of music! It is a 3 piece controller; controller is strapped to your hands, ankles, and a sensor piece that senses when you punch and kick. Players can practice or move on to fitness and attack exercises. The game features real life instructors that will prompt the player to perform tasks. The game features different game modes like arcade mode, practice mode or fitness mode.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "September 12, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Music", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/96219-martial-beat-2\n"}
