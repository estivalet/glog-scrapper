{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bounty Arms", "overview": "Bounty Arms was developed by Data West for the original Playstation and was going to be released in April of 1995. Unfortunately, the game was canceled but a demo of the beta build of Bounty Arms was discovered by Kid Fenris from the Lost Levels forum. The demo was found on the fifth volume of Demo Playstation, a line of discs used in Japanese store kiosks from 1994 through 1997. The demo features half of the game's first level but does not allow either character to take damage. A promotional video along with many magazine scans of Bounty Arms have also been uploaded to the internet, which can be found at Unseen 64 and Kid Fenris' blog.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "December 1, 1995", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Data West", "publishers": "Data West", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/124878-bounty-arms\n"}
