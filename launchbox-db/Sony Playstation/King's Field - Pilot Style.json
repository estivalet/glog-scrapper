{"altername_name": ["King's Field III: Pilot Style"], "name": "King's Field: Pilot Style", "overview": "The three King's Field PS1 games form a trilogy relating the saga of a mythical country named Verdite. King's Field 1 (released only in Japan) was the first RPG for the Playstation console and King's Field 2 (released as \"King's Field\" in the US and EU) was the first ever Playstation RPG in the US and Europe. King's Field: Pilot Style is a mini game whose story takes place in the period between King's Field 2 and King's Field 3. Pilot Style was given away as a promotional item at a game show in Japan and went relatively unnoticed. It only takes about an hour to complete, but it is an interesting tidbit in the King's Field world.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "August 22, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "FromSoftware", "publishers": "FromSoftware", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.7", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/116110-kings-field-pilot-style\n"}
