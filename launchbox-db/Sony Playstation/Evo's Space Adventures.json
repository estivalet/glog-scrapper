{"altername_name": [], "name": "Evo's Space Adventures", "overview": "Space Station Silicon Valley is a platform game that is viewed from a third-person perspective. Players traverse several different environments to advance through the game. During the game, players control Evo\u2014a robot who is reduced to a crawling microchip during a ship crash, and is losing energy at a steady rate without protection. In order to survive, players attack animals, which disables them and allows players to assume control of their bodies. Each animal possesses different characteristics, including survival rate and special attacks, and uses different abilities; for example, large animals such as bears are able to destroy ice blocks, which other animals are incapable of doing so. Some animals are also unable to survive in certain unfamiliar environments, forcing players to enter the body of another. The animals are used to solve puzzles and defeat enemies in each level, collecting Evo's power cells to maintain energy.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "June 15, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "DMA Design", "publishers": "Take-Two Interactive Software Europe", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/A9N0gkzL8XM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/74919-evos-space-adventures\n"}
