{"altername_name": ["Othello World II: Yume to Michi e no Chousen", "Othello World II: Yume to Michi e no Chousen"], "name": "Othello World II: Yumeto Michi he no Chousen", "overview": "Reversi (also marketed by Pressman under the trade name Othello) is a board game involving abstract strategy and played by two players on a board with 8 rows and 8 columns and a set of distinct pieces for each side. Pieces typically are disks with a light and a dark face, each side belonging to one player. The player's goal is to have a majority of their colored pieces showing at the end of the game, turning over as many of their opponent's pieces as possible. Rules: Each of the two sides corresponds to one player; they are referred to here as light and dark after the sides of Othello pieces, but \"heads\" and \"tails\" would identify them equally well, so long as each marker has sufficiently distinctive sides. Originally, Reversi did not have a defined starting position. Later it adopted Othello's rules, which state that the game begins with four markers placed in a square in the middle of the grid, two facing light-up, two pieces with the dark side up. The dark player makes the first move.
