{"altername_name": ["Arcade Gears: Pu-Li-Ru-La"], "name": "Pu-Li-Ru-La: Arcade Gears", "overview": "PuLiRuLa (Pu-Li-Ru-La) is a 1991 arcade game released by Taito. The game was later ported to the FM Towns Marty, Sega Saturn, PlayStation, and PlayStation 2 in Japan. The PS1 and Saturn versions are known as Pu-Li-Ru-La Arcade Gears. The PS2 version is part of a compilation called Taito Memories (Volume 1), but omitted from the international release of Taito Legends. PuLiRuLa is known for its distinct graphics and odd story line. PuLiRuLa takes place in Radishland, a land where time is kept correctly flowing with a time key. However, \"a bad man appeared and stole the time key to stop the time flow. The towns were attacked one by one, the time flow was stopped and they received damage\", as the English translation explains. Zac and Mel, the playable characters, are requested by an old man to defend their town. The old man also gives the children a \"magic stick\" to fight with.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "August 28, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Taito", "publishers": "Xing Entertainment", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxh8p72-raE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/111991-pu-li-ru-la-arcade-gears\n"}
