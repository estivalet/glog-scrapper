You begin at a sector map which functions as a blueprint of the research laboratory which you must explore. In order to clear a level, you must collect a required number of microchips. You must also find exits in each area in order to advance to the next level. The spider is always equipped with a Slasher leg and webbing, and he is capable of enhancing his fighting ability with weapons by collecting power-ups. The weapons include homing missiles, flame throwers, boomerangs, and electro-beams. You'll need these munitions to defend yourself against other spiders, cyber-rats, toxic green frogs, and other laboratory pests in this 3-D side-scrolling platform contest.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "February 26, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Boss Game Studios", "publishers": "Take-Two Interactive", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.52", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider:_The_Video_Game", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOCTZCSSYr8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/587-spider-the-video-game\n"}
