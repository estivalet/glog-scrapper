{"altername_name": ["Persona 2: Tsumi", "Persona 2: Tsumi: Innocent Sin"], "name": "Persona 2: Innocent Sin", "overview": "Persona 2: Innocent Sin is similar in structure and basic gameplay to its predecessor. Much of the game consists of navigating a party of up to five active combatants through locations in the large city, exploring complex dungeons, and fighting randomly appearing demons in round-based style. Unlike the first game, dungeons are viewed from an angled overhead perspective with rotatable camera. Rather than having the option of using either a melee weapon or a gun, each character is equipped with his or her own specific weapon.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "June 24, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atlus", "publishers": "Atlus", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.95", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_2:_Innocent_Sin", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXTVnW4NKaQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/16880-persona-2-innocent-sin\n"}
