{"altername_name": ["Cyber Speed"], "name": "CyberSpeed", "overview": "CYBER SPEED is the world television event of the future. Pilot one of eight ships each with different rankings in thrust, speed, mass, and shield strength on a track of pure energy. The trick is that all of the ships are tethered to the track with an energy loop, which supplies the ship with power. If you make a wrong move and strain the loop, your ship loses power and slows down. However, you can regain ground by picking up turbo boosts or using plasma bolts, missiles, and mines to do away with the opposition. Play the Free Race or Time Trial modes to practice driving, and when you get comfortable tackle all 10 tracks in the Tournament mode. Since the tournament is broadcast around the world, feel free to take a break during the commercials between each race. Do you have the skills to become the CYBER SPEED champion?", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "December 7, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Mindscape", "publishers": "Mindscape", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.22", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CyberSpeed", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kivL2geUbq0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/29067-cyberspeed\n"}
