A nasty burp could send those in his vicinity to the burn unit. Allow us to introduce you to Spyro the Dragon. In his debut adventure, Spyro must free his fellow fire-breathers from their crystalline prisons that are located across six worlds. He'll have to run, jump, glide, walk, roll, and fly his way through each of the 35 levels. And when things get physical, he can use a number of attacks on enemies, including fireballs, charge attacks, and superflames.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "September 10, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Insomniac Games", "publishers": "Sony Computer Entertainment", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.32", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spyro_the_Dragon_(video_game)", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoCmdGpa6Kw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4730-spyro-the-dragon\n"}
