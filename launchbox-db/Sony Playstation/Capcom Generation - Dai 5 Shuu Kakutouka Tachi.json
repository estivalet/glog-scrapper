{"altername_name": [], "name": "Capcom Generation: Dai 5 Shuu Kakutouka Tachi", "overview": "This compilation contains a \"Title Menu\" where the player can choose from any of three Street Fighter II games featured in the compilation: the original Street Fighter II, Champion Edition (Street Fighter II Dash in Japan) and Hyper Fighting (Street Fighter II Dash Turbo in Japan). Some minor changes were made to gameplay, compared to the arcade versions of the games. A \"Collection\" mode is also featured where the player can view strategies, character profiles and artwork specific to each game, some which become available after meeting certain requirements. Each game features an \"Arcade\", \"Versus\" and \"Training\" mode. Upon completing a game's single-player mode, an option is unlocked to give the player a choice between the original CPS soundtracks and an arranged version (which is taken from the 3DO version of Super Street Fighter II Turbo). After completing the single-player mode of each game at least once, a \"Super Vs. Mode\" becomes available at the main menu. The Super Vs. Mode allows two players to compete against each other by selecting between characters from any three versions of Street Fighter II in the compilation (Capcom would employ the same concept for Hyper Street Fighter II). If the player completes a game's single-player mode without using continues, a \"CPU Battle\" mode is unlocked. CPU Battle allows the player to battle any CPU opponent at the game's highest difficulty. If the player manages to defeat the CPU opponent, the game's staff roll will instantly play (Like with the full single-player mode, the player must defeat the CPU opponent without losing a round in order to view the original credits. If the player loses a round but still manages to win, the text-only credits will play).", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "March 12, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Capcom", "publishers": "Capcom", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.04", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/108064-capcom-generation-dai-5-shuu-kakutouka-tachi\n"}
