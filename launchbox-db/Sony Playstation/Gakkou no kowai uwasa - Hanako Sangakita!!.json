{"altername_name": ["Gakkou no Kowai Uwasa - Hanako-san ga Kita!!"], "name": "Gakkou no kowai uwasa: Hanako Sangakita!!", "overview": "Based on the short story \"Ghost Toilet\" from Toru Tsunemitsu's urban myth collection \"School Ghost Stories.\" This was adapted into the children's book \"Hanako in the Toilet: Scary Stories of Your School\" (1993). Several artists then adapted this into the \"Here Comes Hanako\" manga; most of them also wrote the anime version, which was aired as a segment of the TV series \"Ponkikki Kids.\" Episodes, introduced by Hanako, included \"The Haunted Cinema\" and \"The Cursed Promise Ring.\" A 50-minute anime movie, \"Hanako of the Toilet\" (1996), starred Hanako and was directed by Akitaro Daichi. A live-action film of the same name, directed by Joji Matsuoka, also appeared in 1996. \"New Hanako\" (1998) another live-action film, introduced the character of a homeless pervert. Parodies of the Hanako story appeared in \"Haunted Junction,\" in which Kazuo wants to collect \"all the Hanakos\" from every Japanese school; \"Dirty Pair Flash,\" which depicts a Hanako hologram; and \"Hell Teacher Nube,\" depicting a more conventional ghost of Hanako. The game is a first person adventure game in which the player have to explore the school to defeat the demon that is cursing it.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "August 11, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Capcom", "publishers": "Capcom", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/108251-gakkou-no-kowai-uwasa-hanako-sangakita\n"}
