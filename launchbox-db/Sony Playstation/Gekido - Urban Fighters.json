{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gekido: Urban Fighters", "overview": "Gekido features a few gameplay options including the Urban Fighters, Arena Battle, Shadow Fighter, Street Gang Battle, Team Battle and Survival modes. The Urban Fighters option has you (and other friends) selecting one of the four characters and engaging in an all-out war that will come to a close once you've found Angela and destroyed Kintaro. Arena Battle is a tournament based multi-player mode against up to three human players. The idea is to smash your opponents into a bloody pulp using your fists and various weapons. Other gameplay modes such as Shadow Fighter, Street Gang Battle, Team Battle and Survivor must be unlocked -- can you do good enough to earn these extra goodies? Regardless of the gameplay option you've chosen, you'll find a plethora of weapons laying around including machine and hand guns, rifles, flamethrowers, hand grenades, dynamite sticks, knives and lead pipes. You'll use these on a wide variety of enemies ranging from normal street thugs and a giant ape-man to a vicious demon hell-bent on your destruction. Additionally, each character in Gekido: Urban Fighters has his and her own combinations and special rage attacks.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "May 18, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "N.A.P.S", "publishers": "Infogrames", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.90", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gekido", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FGLldrIxnU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/12778-gekido-urban-fighters\n"}
