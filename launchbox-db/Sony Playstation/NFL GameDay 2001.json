{"altername_name": [], "name": "NFL GameDay 2001", "overview": "This edition features lifelike player specific graphics that make players look like their real life counterparts. Also new is commentary by Dick Enberg and Phil Simms. Another feature is total-control passing and running. Total-control passing lets you lead, overthrow, and underthrow your receivers so that you can throw more completions and prevent defenders from intercepting your passes. The play editor has been improved making it easier to make new patterns for your receivers and running backs. The general manager mode has also been changed, mostly to help you with the draft so you can easily see what areas of your team need improvement.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "989 studios", "publishers": "Sony Computer Entertainment America", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "8", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.92", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/79139-nfl-gameday-2001\n"}
