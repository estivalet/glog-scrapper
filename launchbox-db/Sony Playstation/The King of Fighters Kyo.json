{"altername_name": ["The King of Fighters Kyou"], "name": "The King of Fighters Kyo", "overview": "This game's story is considered semi-canon to the series. It is set 11 months after The King of Fighters '96 tournament, a month before The King of Fighters '97 tournament, until the sealing of Orochi. The game focuses on Kyo Kusanagi. The player starts the game in Osaka, where Kyo lives, and travels with him around the world. The player can control Kyo and two other characters. Fights are turn based, with moves selectable from a menu. If a player triggers a desperation move, unique cel animations will be spliced with the move's performance. Almost every character from '94-'97 is playable in the game, but to get them the player must solve sub-quests revolving around each character. The game also marks the introduction of new characters, including members of the families of some characters that were never revealed in the main series.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "August 27, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Yumekobo", "publishers": "SNK", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.62", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73569-the-king-of-fighters-kyo\n"}
