{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sotsugyou R: Graduation Real", "overview": "Sotsugyou R - Graduation Real is a conversion of the PCFX game of the same name (anyway the first version of the game was for the PC98 in 1992). The word sotsugyou means graduation. In the game the player takes the role of newly appointed teacher that arrives at a high school and will try to help the 5 girls to graduate and pass to university, and maybe during the game depending of the player choices he will fall in love with one of them and marry her. Instead of the classic 2d cartoon graphics the game uses real actors images. During each week he will provide different studies for the girls to improve their stats and during weekends he can go to other places. There will be different events (in the school and out of there) and situations that will make him be more or less appreciated by her.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "March 8, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Headroom", "publishers": "Bandai Visual", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/112400-sotsugyou-r-graduation-real\n"}
