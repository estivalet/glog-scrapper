{"altername_name": [], "name": "Simple 1500 Series Vol. 94: The Cameraman: Gekisha Boy Omake Tsuki", "overview": "The player controls a deformed little guy who's about to drop out of photography school due to his parents\u2019 deaths, but is offered a test to graduate by the dean. You walk around taking pictures to gain points and more film. The stranger and more screwed up the image you take is, the more points you get. Some of the things you'll see are pretty sadistic and evil, but that's what makes this game so damn fun to play. The Playstation is a port of the Turbografx-16 title Gekido, The Photo-Boy adds an additional level and two-person simultaneous play that the original game didn't possess. The boy moves along the side scrolling screen watching out for hazards that need jumping over or avoiding. At the same time you have to keep your shutter focused on events in the mid distance to capture exclusive snaps in order to please your boss. Such events include appearances of ET, skirts blowing up Maryln Monroe style, rollerbladers falling flat on their chins... But don't get too snap happy as film is limited. Its often worthwhile to have a shot at seemingly innocent people just to see what happens....", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "May 23, 2002", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "D3Publisher", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/135415-simple-1500-series-vol-94-the-cameraman-gekisha-boy-omake-tsuki\n"}
