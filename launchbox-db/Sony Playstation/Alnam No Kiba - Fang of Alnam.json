{"altername_name": ["Alnam no Kiba: Juuzoku Juuni Shinto Densetsu"], "name": "Alnam No Kiba: Fang of Alnam", "overview": "Alnam no Kiba is a remake of the PC Engine RPG of the same title from two years prior. The same general plot is present, but the entire game has been reworked from a traditional Japanese-style RPG into a Japanese-style adventure or visual novel game. The player controls Kenbu as he explores various locales, speaking to other characters, and sometimes ending up with them tagging along with him. Much of the original game's assets have been reused, but there are also some new graphics and music as well as some differences in the story, creating a very different alternate version of the game. As a bonus, there is also a gallery of fan art with commentary included on the disc.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "February 2, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Right Stuff", "publishers": "Right Stuff", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.62", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109183-alnam-no-kiba-fang-of-alnam\n"}
