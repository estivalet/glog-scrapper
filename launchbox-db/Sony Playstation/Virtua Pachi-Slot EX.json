{"altername_name": [], "name": "Virtua Pachi-Slot EX", "overview": "Virtua Pachi-Slot EX is a pachi-slot (gambling machine) game that features a perfect recreation of 5 gambling machines (Dyno 2, King Shark 2, Snowky, Cleopatra & Big Wave). The game also features the trial, practice and the rankings modes. With the emergence of a new machine, the pachislot capture has come to require even more sophisticated technology. Even with the same one big bonus, depending on how you hit, the number of earned cards will be different by around 50 sheets. I wrote something like a pachislot magazine, but the point is that there is only practice. Of course our software will respond to your efforts.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "November 21, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Map Japan", "publishers": "Map Japan", "genres": "Casino", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/136218-virtua-pachi-slot-ex\n"}
