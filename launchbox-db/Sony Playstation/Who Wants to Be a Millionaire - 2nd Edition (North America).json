Edition", "Chi Vuol Essere Milionario Seconda Edizione"], "name": "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire: 2nd Edition (North America)", "overview": "Trivia buffs and Regis Philbin fans unite -- you can now play the popular ABC game show Who Wants to be a Millionaire on your PlayStation console. Who Wants to be a Millionaire - 2nd Edition features 600 new questions and more smarmy commentary from the suave, aforementioned host. If you have been living under an Atari 2600 and are new to the Millionaire phenomena, you should know that players sitting in the hot seat must answer 15 multiple choice questions in order to win $1,000,000. If you want a chance at a cool million in the two-player mode of this game show simulation, you must first win a fastest finger contest in which you place items (such as films or states) in their proper order. Once you take the hot seat, Regis Philbin will give you a question with four possible answers. Answer it correctly (within the 30-second time limit) and you will win $100. Each ensuing question promises a bigger payoff. The questions start off relatively simple and get progressively more difficult as you work your way up the monetary ladder. Not to be confused with a separate series of European video games, developed by Hothouse Creations and published by Eidos Interactive, which are based on the United Kingdom version of the television show hosted by Chris Tarrant.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "June 20, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Jellyvision", "publishers": "Buena Vista Interactive", "genres": "Quiz", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0o2lNCXhLw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/12885-who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-2nd-edition-north-america\n"}
