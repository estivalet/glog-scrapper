Players take control of an archeologist and treasure hunter Rei Shidoh, who is a part of a team dispatched to ruins on a mysterious island to investigate them and locate survivors of a strong earthquake there. As players complete the first level of the game, Rei will discover a mysterious tall and wide blade that can change its shape and will grow more powerful, gaining unique attacks and spells if special spheres are embedded into it and enough Nervus (experience points) are used to develop it. After picking up the sword, the game will let players test their new weapon on a boss battle. In combat, players can lock on to specific enemies for melee and ranged attacks, similar to The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "September 28, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Roman-Tech", "publishers": "Enix", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaAIaeMA4rM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/32873-blade-arts-tasogare-no-miyako-rlyeh\n"}
