Since this is a board game the game features 3 different boards (small, medium & large) & up to 4 human players to play at the same (as the fathers of the 4 girls) time. The game features 4 unlockables pictures galleries of the 4 girls that can be unlocked playing the main board game.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "September 10, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Axela", "publishers": "Axela", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/135776-kimagure-my-baby-musume-no-sugoroku-seichouki\n"}
