{"altername_name": ["Ninpu Sentai Harikenger", "Ninpuu Sentai Hurricanger", "Power Rangers Ninja Storm"], "name": "Ninpu Sentai Hurricanger", "overview": "Ninpu Sentai Harikenger is based on the popular Japanese Sentai of the same name. Also it was known in the U.S. as Power Rangers Ninja Storm. Is the sequel to Hyakujuu Sentai GaoRanger. You start out with just a Story mode and a 1 on 1 fighting mode. As you progress, however, many more modes become available. The in-game action is fairly the same as Hyakujuu Sentai GaoRanger's, except that now you have Street-Fighter style special moves you can do in addition to the normal punches and kicks. In GaoRanger you were limited to just GaoRed. In Harikenger you can select from the Red, Blue, or Yellow Harikengers, and in certain stages the Kabutoraijer, Kuwagataraijer, Shurikenger, and, in a special mode, another ranger from a previous series. Once you were done with GaoRanger's story mode all you really had was a survival mode. In Harikenger you get that and so much more.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "November 28, 2002", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Natsume", "publishers": "Bandai", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/77862-ninpu-sentai-hurricanger\n"}
