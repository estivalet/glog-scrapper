{"altername_name": ["ESPN Street Games", "1Xtreme"], "name": "ESPN Extreme Games", "overview": "ESPN Extreme Games lets the player access three modes of play: Exhibition, New Season, or a continuation of a season. Exhibition mode helps the player get to know the courses and equipment as well as get a feel for the controls. New season offers the player the chance to race against sixteen other competitors on any of the four racing machines competing for season points as well as money to upgrade equipment. Choose between rollerblades, a luge (basically a sit-down skateboard), a mountain bike, and a skateboard. The player can also determine which character they want to race with, each one having a unique skill on one of the apparatus. For example, one might be top-notch at rollerblading but be bad at bike riding. In a season, the player competes in the five locations - three times, twelve in all and each time the obstacles become more and more tricky to avoid as well as the other racers become faster and more agile. Sony's ESPN license had expired by the time the game's Greatest Hits release came out in 1998, hence it was retitled 1Xtreme (a sequel named 2Xtreme had been released in 1997) and all ESPN logos and video footage were removed from the release.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "September 9, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Sony Interactive Studios America", "publishers": "Sony Computer Entertainment America", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.10", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN_Extreme_Games", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Npzcxtb918M", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72743-espn-extreme-games\n"}
