Four of the courses in the coastal community of Pebble Beach, including Pebble Beach Golf Links, belong to the Pebble Beach Company, which also operates three hotels and a spa at the resort. The other courses are The Links at Spanish Bay, Spyglass Hill Golf Course, and Del Monte Golf Course. Pebble Beach is widely regarded as one of the most beautiful courses in the world. It hugs the rugged coastline and has wide open views of the ocean. In 2001 it became the first public course (i.e. open to the general public for play) to be selected as the No.1 Golf Course in America by Golf Digest. Green fees are among the highest in the world, at $495 (plus $35 cart fee for non-resort guests) per round in 2008. The course is included in many golfing games such as the Links series and the Tiger Woods PGA Tour series. Pebble Beach no Hatou Plus is the sequel to the Megadrive game Pebble Beach no Hatou that was released in 1994.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "December 13, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "T&E Soft", "publishers": "Soft Bank", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/96628-pebble-beach-no-hatou-plus\n"}
