{"altername_name": ["Monster Farm"], "name": "Monster Rancher", "overview": "One takes the role of a monster breeder whose goal is to raise monsters to fight in tournaments. The breeder must take it in hand to raise the monster throughout its life, training it, keeping it healthy, making an exercise schedule, and trying to maximize its abilities before it dies of old age or is retired. Monsters have good or bad morale depending on how they are raised; loyal monsters are more likely to perform critical hits, while disloyal monsters might refuse to obey commands or not fight at all. Retired monsters can be combined to create more powerful monsters.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "July 24, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Tecmo", "publishers": "Tecmo", "genres": "Life Simulation", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.30", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_Rancher_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/19428-monster-rancher\n"}
