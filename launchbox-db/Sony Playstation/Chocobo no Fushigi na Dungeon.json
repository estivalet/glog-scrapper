{"altername_name": ["Chocobo's Mysterious Dungeon"], "name": "Chocobo no Fushigi na Dungeon", "overview": "Chocobo's Mysterious Dungeon is a video game made for the Sony PlayStation and Bandai WonderSwan. The game is vaguely linked to the Final Fantasy series by the series' trademark mascot, the chocobo. The title character in Chocobo's Mysterious Dungeon is a yellow chocobo named Poulet (???, Pure?) (a pun on the Japanese \"pureiya\" meaning \"player\" and the French word \"poulet\" meaning \"chicken\"), but the player can rename him. Poulet is accompanied by his moogle traveling companion, Atla. Chocobo's Mysterious Dungeon borrows many of its game play elements from the Mystery Dungeon sub-genre of rogue-like RPGs. Dungeon layouts are randomly generated, along with the appearance of enemies and items. Items discovered by the player are initially unidentified and may be cursed or otherwise have adverse effects when used or equipped.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "December 23, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Square", "publishers": "Bandai", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Chocobo_media#Games", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5SiI97oxis", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/65753-chocobo-no-fushigi-na-dungeon\n"}
