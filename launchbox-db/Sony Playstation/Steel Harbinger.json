{"altername_name": [], "name": "Steel Harbinger", "overview": "It's the year 2069 and the Earth is under attack. Prior to landing, aliens shower the world with thousands of pods, unleashing a force so destructive that all of Earth's armies are powerless to stop it. A legion of teaming metallic tendrils bursts from the pods, infecting nearly every living life form, including humans, animals, plants, and insects, transforming them into mindless killing machines. Dwindling in numbers by the minute, the Earth and all of her citizens are quickly becoming ripe for invasion. During the infestation, Miranda gets partially infected by the tendrils, which turn her body into a powerful weapon but leave her with her basic human instincts intact. With guidance from her scientist father Dr. Bowen, Miranda is the only one powerful enough to save the world. In Steel Harbinger, a darkly futuristic running, jumping, 3-D shoot-'em-up, you must guide Miranda through certain areas of Kansas, Las Vegas, San Francisco, Houston, Cape Canaveral, Washington, the Antarctic, an alien planetoid, and the Moon. In each level you'll have specific missions to accomplish such as killing aliens, finding special weapons, saving humans, opening secret rooms, activating defense facilities, and destroying key enemy sites. You can teleport between locations by finding teleport cards and telepads. Access to specific buildings and other restricted areas can be gained with pass cards that you will find hidden throughout the levels. In addition to the standard action, you can also commandeer trucks, hovercraft, floating discs, and tanks.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "October 12, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "M - Mature", "developers": "Mindscape", "publishers": "Mindscape", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.73", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYZWcnahIuA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/11417-steel-harbinger\n"}
