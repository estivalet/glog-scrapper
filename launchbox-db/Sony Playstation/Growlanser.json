{"altername_name": [], "name": "Growlanser", "overview": "Growlanser is a fantasy SRPG (strategy role-playing game), and the first in the Growlanser series of games. The main character is Carmaine, an orphan raised by the palace royal magician, Sandra. Prophesied as an infant to become either \"the darkness to destroy the world\" or \"the light which saves it\", Sandra carefully watches over him and never allows him to leave Rolandia's capital city, Rosaria, or have any contact with the outside world. However, throughout his childhood Carmaine experiences strange and vivid dreams of people and places he knows nothing about. When at last he becomes old enough, Sandra tells him it is time to go out and explore beyond the city gates. Accompanied by Tippi, his tiny fairy-like companion, he leaves the city to discover his destiny. The game has a complex storyline with branching paths. During his travels Carmaine will discover different lands and peoples. Among them are the Growsians, humans who can wield ancient magic, and the Featherians, a winged race of people. As the story progresses, Carmaine discovers that there are conspiratorial enemies seeking to cause trouble for the land and people. Carmaine's personality, stats and skills are determined by answering questions at the beginning of the game. Eventually other characters can join Carmine's party, some whose recruitment requires fulfilling certain conditions. Romance elements are possible with some party members. Combat between enemies and the large party of controllable characters is a mixture of real-time and turn-based styles. Strategic battles occupy the entire location; depending upon where the battle occurs, non-party members nearby (such as townspeople, soldiers etc.) may help the party by joining in.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "November 25, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Career Soft", "publishers": "Atlus", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.62", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growlanser_I", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/43309-growlanser\n"}
