In the game, each player is dealt either thirteen or sixteen tiles in a hand (depending on the variation being played). On their turn, players draw a tile and discard one, with the goal of making four or five melds (also depending on the variation) and one pair, or \"head\". Winning comes \"on the draw\", by drawing a new or discarded tile that completes the hand.
