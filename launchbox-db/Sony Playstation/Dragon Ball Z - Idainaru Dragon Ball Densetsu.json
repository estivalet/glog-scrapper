{"altername_name": ["Dragon Ball Z: The Legend"], "name": "Dragon Ball Z: Idainaru Dragon Ball Densetsu", "overview": "Dragon Ball Z - Idainaru Dragon ball Densetsu, better know as Dragon ball Z - Legends, is the second installment of Bandai's series of Dragon Ball Z games. The game starts with the events of the Saiyan Saga and the fight with Vegeta and Nappa. In this game up to 6 people can be on screen at one time!. In story mode, it takes you from the battle with Nappa and Vegeta on Earth to the battle with Buu. just like the Tv show. At the beginning of each fight you are given a total of 4 fighters (up to 6 later) from which you have to choose the 3 that you would like to participate in the battle that follows. Each fighter has 2 bars. a green and a yellow one. The green represents the life force and the yellow the power force which is depleted with every attack you do. At the bottom of the screen there is a blue bar and a red one that form a gauge called Power Balance. The reason for this gauge to be there is because your attacks don\u2019t affect the enemies\u2019 life bar directly. By continuously attacking the enemy the bar that represents your power (blue bar) increases while that of the enemy (red bar) decreases. When the blue bar covers all the gauge a random attack sequence, from the current character you\u2019re controlling, is initiated and that\u2019s how you can actually injure your opponents. The same can happen to you though if the enemy\u2019s red bar covers all the gauge. GAME MODES: - Special Mode: Opened when you beat Story Mode.
