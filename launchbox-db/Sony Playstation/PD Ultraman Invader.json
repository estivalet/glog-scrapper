PD Ultraman Invaders features the TV hero Ultraman in a version of Space Invaders in which the player have to destroy all the aliens in the screen to advance to the next level. The game features different game modes like the arcade one or the vs one in which the players can play. The game features different camera angles and even features the original Space Invaders arcade machine that can be played too.
