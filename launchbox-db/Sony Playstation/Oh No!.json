{"altername_name": [], "name": "Oh No!", "overview": "In Oh No! you control a group of (literally) snot-nosed brats who are trying to get to the end of each stage without going hungry or getting killed. The boys run uncontrollably forward, either in a horizontal or vertical line; you can switch between the formations with the triangle button. To keep your health meter up, the boys must eat hamburgers lying on the ground. Avoid the fish sandwiches, though. They will deplete your health because, as we all know, street fish is just nasty. At the end of each stage, Oh No! gives you a nice change of pace -- a dancing mini-game similar to Bust a Groove.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "November 16, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Asmik Ace Entertainment", "publishers": "Asmik Ace Entertainment", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.43", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40348-oh-no\n"}
