{"altername_name": ["Falcata: Astran Pardma no Monshou"], "name": "Falcata", "overview": "Falcata was one of the first games released on Playstation in Japan, and for sure it was a strange one, the game is a mix between an strategy board game and a RPG game. In the game screen, the game draws a line connecting some different circles on a map, given a genuine and bizarre sense of atmosphere. The game is set in 1500 BC in a land with different cities and hostile tribes, that makes most of the people to travel to other lands. The goal of the game is to restore the land so the people can stop their endless wandering, and finally arrived to that land and that will end with the tribal fights. The player's character will be the hero to reach that? Only time will tell. The game features 6 different parties that can be customized in their clothes and hair, all of them with their own stats. The gameplay is about going around those places and examine them, in some of them you will have to fight and then the game takes the usual rpg style with turns to choose the proper actions that the player wants his characters to do. But instead of fights he can also pay to avoid the fights, make pacts or discover relics, etc.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "June 30, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gust", "publishers": "Gust", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/108241-falcata\n"}
