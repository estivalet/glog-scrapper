{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mahjong Taikai II Special", "overview": "Mahjong Taikai II was first released in the SNES console and ported to Saturn, Dreamcast and Playstation consoles. These are single player games (as with card games Mahjong player have hidden hands, so multiplayer with one screen wouldn't work too well) with virtual opponents. The Mahjong rules used are Japanese Riichi (Reach) rules, which is a somewhat streamlined version of traditional Mahjong rules where the emphasis is on building special hands to get lots of points -- Mahjong players should take note that terms used in this game are Japanese rather than Chinese, though they are similar so it's not difficult to adjust.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "November 29, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Koei", "publishers": "Koei", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/110075-mahjong-taikai-ii-special\n"}
