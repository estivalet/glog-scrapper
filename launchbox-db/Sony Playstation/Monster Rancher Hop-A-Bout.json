{"altername_name": ["Monster Farm Jump"], "name": "Monster Rancher Hop-A-Bout", "overview": "Monster Rancher Hop-A-Bout is a platform adventure game based on characters from the Monster Rancher video games and animated TV series. Hop-A-Bout is an addictive and easy-to-learn title that challenges players to hop their way through more than a hundred obstacle courses. Designed to be 'fun for the whole family', Hop-A-Bout features arcade-style gameplay that is easy to learn and difficult to master. Hop-A-Bout players can choose from a cast of colorful Monster Rancher characters to start their journey. Armed with the ability to bounce slow or fast and to the right or left, characters must move from one end of a playing course to the other, avoiding dangerous obstacles and holes along the way. Hopping onto various panels in each course helps or hinders progress, depending on the panel (a heart panel increases life, while a skull decreases life). Additional features of Monster Rancher Hop-A-Bout include one and two-player modes and a stage edit function that allows players to create up to four customized courses that can be saved.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "December 10, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Tecmo", "publishers": "Tecmo", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0t-zg9rakY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73142-monster-rancher-hop-a-bout\n"}
