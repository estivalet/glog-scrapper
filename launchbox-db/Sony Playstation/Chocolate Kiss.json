{"altername_name": [], "name": "Chocolate Kiss", "overview": "Chocolate Kiss is a romantic visual novel adventure game featuring a high school student as a protagonist. The game story starting in January, and this year, he is determined to find a girlfriend that will give him a chocolate for Valentine's Day. And he has only one month time to achieve that goal. The game story advances through days, and allows player to go to different location (by selecting where to go via dialogue window option rather than using a map travel) and depending where he goes he will run into a different girl, all of which are potential candidates for becoming his girlfriend. The game is a typical visual novel adventure game and features static 2D anime characters over background images that are mostly real-live photos touched to look less real-life like, with occasional 2D art, which is more prominent in CG event scenes. Dialogue window is on the bottom and dialogues are distinguished from thoughts by having a character's name prefixed. Aside from main character, all on-screen NPCs have full voice-over during dialogues. Typical features such as message log or toggling dialogue window to see clear background are also available. Bonus feature includes CG gallery which contains unlocked CG art, depending on branch in the story the player takes, and because there are many girls to end up with, there are many different story arcs and endings.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "February 14, 2002", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Infinity", "publishers": "DigiCube", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.38", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133970-chocolate-kiss\n"}
