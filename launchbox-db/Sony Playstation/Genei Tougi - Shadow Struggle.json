{"altername_name": [], "name": "Genei Tougi: Shadow Struggle", "overview": "The Phillips Foundation is sponsoring a grapple tournament, and the prize is ten million dollars. Eight warriors have gathered to take part in the tournament -- some for the money, some for the fame, and some for more personal reasons. The name of the tournament is...POWER OF SOLID. Shadow Struggle is a fast-paced 3D fighting game similar to its contemporary Toshinden. There are eight playable characters each with their own moves. During the fights, in addition to their health meter, each character has a \"Shadow Skill Gauge\" that fills up as blows are exchanged. When it fills up and starts flashing, they can unleash their \"Shadow Skill\", allowing them a short burst of increased attack speed and power. The game features standard Arcade and Versus modes, as well as a mode called Arena game in which you fight to win credits, which can be used to buy new moves and customize your character. Saved characters can be used against each other in two-player bouts. In the game there is an Arena Mode in which players can edit the characters' special moves. But it requires credits to do so. To earn credits player must fight at the arena and earn points/credits by winning.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "September 20, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Racdym", "publishers": "Banpresto", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/33427-genei-tougi-shadow-struggle\n"}
