They start to destroy the city with their abilities and the only thing that can stop them is a group of young people who can become Gaorangers. The Story is a lot more complicated in the T.V. show, but has been simplified for the game. The game concentrates more on action than story. But it is still explained in a series of cut-scenes and FMV sequences. The player takes control of Gaored (the red gaoranger) and fights their way through levels of minion-like badies, occasionally being helped by their team-mates. The controls are simple and there are many special moves and combos that can be performed. Once the little bad guys are defeated, onto the boss monster of the level. Once he is defeated, the enemy scorceress comes along and makes him grow to an enormous size. The gaorangers then summon their giant robot to defeat the giant sized monster. Then it's on to the next level.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "November 29, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Natsume", "publishers": "Bandai", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.09", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/97605-hyakujuu-sentai-gaoranger\n"}
