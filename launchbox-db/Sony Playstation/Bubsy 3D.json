Designed by Michael Berlyn, the game was released on November 25, 1996 in North America and in August 1997 in Europe. It is the fourth in the Bubsy series and, as the title indicates, the first (and only) Bubsy game in 3D. It also pioneered a 3D platformer, with very limited movement. The name of the game is a pun between the words \"furry\" and \"Forbidden Planet,\" a 1956 science fiction film. Lani Minella voices her to all the characters in the game, including Bubsy. https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubsy_3D Run jump swim and fly anywhere in huge 3D worlds full of zany humor and the Bubsy 'tude!
