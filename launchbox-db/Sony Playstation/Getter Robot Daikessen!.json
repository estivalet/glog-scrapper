{"altername_name": ["Getter Robo the Big Battle!", "Getter Robo Daikessen!"], "name": "Getter Robot Daikessen!", "overview": "This game's storyline is somewhat the same as the original Getter Robot anime, with some new additions, like our new pilots, Akira and Kei. The game begins with the player is being introduced to the Saotome Research Institute and a movie in which the Getta moves by itself - Prof. Saotome ruminates on how he has to get the Getta operational to fight the invaders from the stars. Ryouma Nagare is recruited and it's off to the first mission. After calming the frantic Hayato down enough to launch the battle starts and the game begins. The plot involves three strong-willed teenagers: martial artist Ryoma Nagare, rebel loner Hayato Jin and Judo master Musashi Tomoe, who pilot three specially designed combat jets which can be combined together into three different giant robots, Getter-1 (for flight combat), Getter-2 (speed advantage for ground\\undeground combat), and Getter-3 (strength advantage for submarine combat). They were assembled by Prof. Saotome, who conceived the Getter Robo project as a means of deep-space exploration; it became instead Earth's first line of defense against the Dinosaur Empire, a civilization of reptile-like humanoids who evolved from the now-extinct dinosaurs that roamed the earth millions of years ago. They have lived many years underground, and they now want to reclaim the Earth as theirs and destroy humanity.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "September 9, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "TechnoSoft", "publishers": "Bandai Visual", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.62", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/108257-getter-robot-daikessen\n"}
