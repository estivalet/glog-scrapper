{"altername_name": [], "name": "You Don't Know Jack: Mock 2", "overview": "You Don't Know Jack, which has long been considered the reigning king of PC trivia games, is coming back for another outing on the PlayStation. This latest installment, titled You Don't Know Jack: Mock 2, pits players against a barrage of over 800 questions, ranging from famous '80s movies all the way to obscure trivia about New England. This mix of traditional trivia and pop culture has proved to be a party favorite for many years now, and this PlayStation offering is bound to be a hit for the casual console owner as well, as it keeps in tune with the tried and true brand of snide humor that has made the entire YDKJ series so fun to play. What makes Mock 2 different from previous YDKJ games is the fact that the each round of play focuses on one similar word or theme. While previous Jack games featured different categories, Mock 2 requires you to dig deep in your mind for everything associated with the theme that has been chosen. For example, one game featured questions about plastic - which brand of plastic was invented first, album titles from the Plastic Ono Band, and so on. In the end, it serves to add an interesting twist to something that already worked well.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "November 6, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Jellyvision Games", "publishers": "Sierra On-Line", "genres": "Quiz", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/31104-you-dont-know-jack-mock-2\n"}
