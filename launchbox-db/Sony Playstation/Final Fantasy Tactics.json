The game's story follows Ramza Beoulve, a highborn cadet who finds himself thrust into the middle of a military conflict known as The Lion War, where two opposing noble factions are coveting the throne of the kingdom. As the story progresses, Ramza and his allies discover a sinister plot behind the war. Final Fantasy Tactics features battles fought on a map divided into a grid in which units can move. The order of units' turns is determined by an \"Active-Time\" like system, and actions can only be executed within a range of the units' position. Units each have a job class which provides them abilities, but they can also equip abilities from other jobs they have leveled up or mastered.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "June 20, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Square", "publishers": "Square", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.56", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_Tactics", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPbKVvyWk4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1504-final-fantasy-tactics\n"}
