It is very similar to the previous release, again based on the board game but not a direct translation of any version, and the main differences are additional content as opposed to any mechanical changes. Up to four players take turns spinning a roulette to move along the game board through each stage of their life, starting from infancy (as opposed to high school in the previous game) all the way through to retirement, with the winner being the player who gathers the most wealth. Each of the three maps this time features a theme \u2014 fantasy, travel across Japan, or the four seasons \u2014 and has a similar length. There are a large number of new events and mini-games compared to the previous release, and the game length can also be configured to allow for games as short as one hour.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "July 24, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kid", "publishers": "Takara", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/108116-dx-jinsei-game-ii-the-game-of-life\n"}
