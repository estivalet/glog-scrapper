Choose wisely from ten line weights and 20 different lures to land the prize catch. The game features three modes of play - Arcade, Recreation, and Tournament - and the player's best catches are preserved for posterity in a virtual gallery. There sure are some tough critters swimming around below the water\u2019s surface, but you\u2019re just the angler to catch them all. SALTWATER SPORTFISHING presents you with more than its fair share of obstacles. While you have to battle the fish, you\u2019ll also be racing against the clock and some of the most skilled fisherman the world has to offer.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "November 28, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Coresoft", "publishers": "Take-Two Interactive Software", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/11381-saltwater-sportfishing\n"}
