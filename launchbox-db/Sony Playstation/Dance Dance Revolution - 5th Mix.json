{"altername_name": ["DDR 5th Mix"], "name": "Dance Dance Revolution: 5th Mix", "overview": "Dance Dance Revolution 5thMIX, or DDR 5th Mix, is the 5th game in the Dance Dance Revolution series of music video games. It was released to the arcades by Konami on March 27, 2001. Although only officially released in Japan, units exist worldwide. DDR 5th Mix contains a total of 122 songs, nine of which are hidden and unlockable. Of those songs, 40 of them (including all nine unlockable songs) are brand new to Dance Dance Revolution. The core gameplay of DDR 5thMIX is the same as the previous Dance Dance Revolution games. The scoring formula is different from previous versions. The top score for a song is 5,000,000 + (f * 5,000,000), where f is the foot rating of the song. The top score for a one-foot song is 10 million, and the top score for a 9-foot song is 50 million. Bonus points are then added based on performance; the bonus added is calculated in the same way as scores in DDR 4th Mix, but with Perfects being worth a base of 55 points (instead of 777) and Greats a base of 33 points (instead of 555), and a flat amount of points based on the letter grade received is then added, ranging from 100 points for a D to 10,000,000 points for an AAA. 5th Mix was the last arcade mix before SuperNOVA to feature dancing characters. Twelve characters are selectable, six male characters for the left-side player (Afro, Rage, Johnny, Robo 2001, Spike and Baby-Lon) and six female characters for the right-side player (Janet, Emi, Charmy, Princess-Zukin, Maho and Alice). Legendary Konami and DDR Music Producer Naoki Maeda was inserted as one of two hidden dancing characters. The home version of DDR 5th Mix was released in Japan on September 22, 2001, for the Sony PlayStation video game console. It contains 47 songs, 9 unlockables, plus seven extra hidden songs that appear as a preview to the next arcade version, DDRMAX, for a total of 16 unlockable songs. The mix also contained song edits contributed by players.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "March 27, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Music", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.42", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_Dance_Revolution_4thMix#Sequel", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkxwzzRBgDA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/92950-dance-dance-revolution-5th-mix\n"}
