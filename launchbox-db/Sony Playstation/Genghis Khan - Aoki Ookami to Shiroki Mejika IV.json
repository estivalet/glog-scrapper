{"altername_name": [], "name": "Genghis Khan: Aoki Ookami to Shiroki Mejika IV", "overview": "Genghis Khan: Aoki Ookami to Shiroki Mejika IV (\u30c1\u30f3\u30ae\u30b9\u30cf\u30fc\u30f3\u30fb\u84bc\u304d\u72fc\u3068\u767d\u304d\u725d\u9e7fIV) is a 1998 video game developed by Koei. It is part of Koei's Historical Simulation Series of games, and is the sequel to Genghis Khan II: Clan of the Gray Wolf (which is actually the third game in the series). Unlike the previous games, IV was developed for very few platforms: Microsoft Windows and PlayStation. Gameplay: The player is given the option to conquer either the country of Mongolia as Genghis Khan himself, or to play as a world leader and take over the known world of the time. The game is turn-based, and very similar to the Romance of the Three Kingdoms series in that everything is done with generals, and managing them is an important part of the game. Unlike Genghis Khan II, in this game the player has absolute control over everything; for example, previously, unless the king was in a given territory, he could not directly control it. The game also includes a turn-based battle sequence, allowing specific control to the player or delegated to a general. Unlike the previous Series, players can use any countries.
