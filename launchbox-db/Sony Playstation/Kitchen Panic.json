{"altername_name": [], "name": "Kitchen Panic", "overview": "Incredibly cute platformer in which you play a little brown thing, hopping along through giant kitchen levels filled with gushing tap water, stacks of dishes, vicious serrated knives and tin cans, valuable vegetables, dangerous soap bubbles and so forth. The gameplay gimmick here is spin: during a jump you can press up or down to start your character to spinning forward or back. Then when next you press Jump, hell either launch himself way straight up (backspin) or a long way forward (front spin). And of course theres plenty of call to use the spin jumps", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "December 28, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Panther Software", "publishers": "Panther Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/122893-kitchen-panic\n"}
