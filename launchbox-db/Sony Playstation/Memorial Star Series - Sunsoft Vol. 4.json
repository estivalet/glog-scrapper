The game has two modes of gameplay. The first mode is where the player controls SOPHIA in a two\u2013dimensional platform mode; the second mode is where the player controls Jason while outside SOPHIA in either the same 2D platform mode or in a top-down perspective. Gameplay in the top-down perspective consists of a series of labyrinths in which players navigate and defeat enemies along the way. Gameplay is non-linear, meaning that players must return to previous levels in order to advance to higher levels in the game. The objective is to complete all eight levels and destroy the mutants and their bosses with various weaponry such as guns, grenades, and special weapons Jason and SOPHIA have separate power meters that decrease whenever they sustain damage by an enemy or any other hazardous object or whenever Jason falls from a high place. They lose a life if either of their power meters runs out, and the game ends when they lose all of their lives. The player gets five continues which allow them to restart the game at the same level in which they have lost all their lives. Players can restore their power meter by collecting power capsules that appear in various places. LIPPLE ISLAND: Is a adventure game developed by Tokai Engineering and published by Sunsoft.
