{"altername_name": [], "name": "Miss Spider's Tea Party", "overview": "Miss Spider's Tea Party invites children 3 to 7 years old to enter children's book author David Kirk's world of color and wonder. Mini-games provide hours of fun with a healthy serving of age-appropriate basic skills practice. Miss Spider's friends want to attend her party, but they each have a problem that needs to be resolved. It's up to the child to play the games and help all the friends make it to the party. When the child succeeds at all mini-games, Miss Spider thanks the player with an invitation of their own -- something to print and cherish. Each game has an easy, medium and difficult level. The game contains a lot of 3D images and animation that capture the unique look and feel of the book.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "November 1, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Hypnotix", "publishers": "Simon & Schuster Interactive", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx_-2kvwXrA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/77228-miss-spiders-tea-party\n"}
