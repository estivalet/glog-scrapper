Unlike the first game you can now pick the player yourself, instead of being assigned one, which allows you to make some unconventional choices, such as playing a goal keeper. You play the game from a third person perspective. You can perform typical moves for soccer games, and also have the option to give commands to your teammates, to pass, shoot or intercept. After each match you are presented with statistical graphs and you are graded for your play. Game modes include friendly matches, two tourneys and a league. You can play with or against a friend in split-screen mode. Create-A-Player is in this new update and it does the job perfectly.
