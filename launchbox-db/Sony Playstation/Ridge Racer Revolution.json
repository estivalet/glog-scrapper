{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ridge Racer Revolution", "overview": "Ridge Racer Revolution is an enhanced remake of Namco's drift-heavy arcade hit, Ridge Racer. Select one of four initially available vehicles, each rated in top speed, acceleration, handling, and grip, before challenging 11 computer-controlled drivers on a choice of three courses. Play modes include \"Race,\" \"Time Trial,\" and \"Free Run.\" Race is a single event consisting of three laps, time trial is a battle between two cars, and free run lets you practice each course by yourself. You can drive from a first-person perspective or from a view behind your car. The gameplay system remains unchanged from Ridge Racer with its set of checkpoints, time-limit and track layout (which remains the same at the beginning but then changes significantly). Like usual, the game consists of three course modes. But, the course level names are changed. They are called \"Novice\", \"Intermediate\" and \"Expert\". Also, all the circuits are all different between the course levels.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "December 3, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Namco", "publishers": "Namco", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.73", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridge_Racer_Revolution", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC5pARYKEDI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/11367-ridge-racer-revolution\n"}
