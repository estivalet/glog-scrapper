{"altername_name": ["Aerodive"], "name": "Skydiving Extreme", "overview": "This Natsume entry into the realm of extreme sports gaming puts the player in charge of a squad of highly-trained synchronized skydivers. As in reality, there is a short period between the time the diver leaves the plane and has to open his chute and the game's challenge comes in aligning the free-falling team members to form impressive formations before the time limit expires. Players can lead their team in competition against a string of computer-controlled international contenders, or go head-to-head against a friend. Each squad can perform over 40 different formations and a practice mode allows the player to perfect his skills without the time limit.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "August 9, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Metro", "publishers": "Natsume", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/13155-skydiving-extreme\n"}
