{"altername_name": [], "name": "Umi no Oh! Yah!", "overview": "One of the things that really makes a difference in Umi No Oh! Yah! from the rest of fishing games is that you first select the fishing spot on the map and then you have to drive the boat until those places (there is an auto pilot mode) and we you arrive there you can start to fish. The game features a story mode and a training mode to learn how to catch a fish. In this game to fish you don't move the rod, you move the boat. The story mode is about trying to catch the biggest swordfish, but the game features too different competitions and events. Features: Different kind of boats. Different places to fish Different kinds of bait & lures. Different kind of boat's crews. The graphics are impressive and the gameplay is really different from other fishing games.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "October 29, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Progress", "publishers": "Victor Interactive Software", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/134908-umi-no-oh-yah\n"}
