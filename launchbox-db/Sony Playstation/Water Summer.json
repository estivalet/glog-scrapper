In the first chapter, the player assumes the role of Akira Kazuma and centers around his interaction with the first chapter's sole main heroine Itsuki Minase. In the second chapter, the protagonist is Souji Kamishiro who interacts with the second chapter's heroine Sayaka Shirakawa. In the third chapter, the player plays as Yoshikazu Masaki who interacts with two heroines, Akane Masaki and Touko Kyouya. In the fourth and final chapter, the player assumes the role of Hiroshi Inaba and centers around his interaction with a heroine who remains nameless throughout the story. Water Summer gameplay requires little interaction from the player as most of the game's duration is spent reading the text that appears on the game screen, which represents either dialogue between the various characters or the inner thoughts of the protagonist. After progressing through the text, the player will come to a \"decision point\" where he or she must choose from multiple options. The time between these decision points varies. Gameplay pauses at these points and depending on which choice the player makes, the plot will progress in a specific direction.

The player must replay the game multiple times and make different choices during decision points to view all five plot lines.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "July 18, 2002", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Princess Soft", "publishers": "Princess Soft", "genres": "Life Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "0.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/136059-water-summer\n"}
