{"altername_name": ["Lupupu Cube: Lup Salad"], "name": "Lup Salad: Lupupu Cube", "overview": "Salad is a young girl and, ironically, considering her name, a huge fan of cake. With a 2D side-on view of a puzzle, the aim is to clear it of coloured blocks by pushing them around with Salad and matching three or more together. Any number of blocks in a horizontal line can be pushed at once, however any blocks atop them will remain stationary and will fall on Salad should she push away the block below. Matching at least three of the same colour causes those blocks to disappear and any blocks they were supporting to drop down. While Salad is fairly agile and can jump gaps of one space, or hop up to a block one level higher (or a combination of the two) there are many places she cannot reach without the aid of the coloured blocks she can push around so it\u2019s often important to keep them around. The game got a re-release on the Nintendo DS with the name of Loopop Cube: Lup Salad.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "October 30, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Fupac", "publishers": "Datam Polystar", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/96371-lup-salad-lupupu-cube\n"}
