{"altername_name": ["Street Fighter: Real Battle on Film"], "name": "Street Fighter: The Movie", "overview": "Street Fighter: The Movie is a 2D beat 'em up game based on the movie of the same name, which in turn is based on the well known Capcom series, Street Fighter. Using digitized animation based on the actors and the many locations featured in the film, the same style of gameplay found in Street Fighter II and Super Street Fighter II Turbo is used here. Select from a range of fighters (including Ryu, Ken, Guile, M. Bison and Chun Li) each with their own set of special moves, and defeat all of the opposition to become the King of Street Fighting. Also included is a story mode which follows the story of the movie and uses FMV in-between fights and a Trial Battle Mode, where you take on Guile in a range of different battle events to test your skills.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "August 11, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Capcom", "publishers": "Acclaim Entertainment", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.65", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_Fighter:_The_Movie_(console_video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTtooxGd3EM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/11420-street-fighter-the-movie\n"}
