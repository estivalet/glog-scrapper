{"altername_name": [], "name": "Worms Pinball", "overview": "Addiction Pinball (sometimes shortened to AdPin) is a pinball simulation game released in 1998 for PC, featuring tables based on two popular Team 17 games - Worms and World Rally Fever. It was later ported to the PlayStation and released as Worms Pinball to capitalise on the success of the Worms franchise. The PC version was published by Microprose, while the PlayStation version was published by Infogrames, who had recently acquired Microprose. The game itself was developed in-house at Team17. TABLES: 1 - World Rally Fever: Based on the game of the same name, the WRF table is based around the theme of racing cars and car maintenance, in a similar fashion to Pinball Fantasies' \"Speed Devil\" table. The primary goal in this table, short of accruing the highest score, is to participate in various races. The top part of the table is sometimes difficult to see however, depending on your preferred viewing angle. 2 - Worms: The highly successul Worms franchise provides the theme for this table. The aim of this table is to complete missions and collect weapons in order to increase your rank and move on to the next area (there are five - Arctic, Mars, Jungle, Desert and Hell). This table is perhaps more difficult than the World Rally Fever table, But provides more space for the ball to travel and has more ramps and bonuses than its counterpart.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "November 1, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Team17 Software", "publishers": "Infogrames", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsoSOY_MC3Y", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/22763-worms-pinball\n"}
