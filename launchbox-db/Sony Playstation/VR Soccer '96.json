Most of the features people later took for granted in football games were pioneered, or at least fairly fresh, when they appeared in the first of the Actua Sports titles.

A full range of customised tournaments were available, as well as multi-player options allowing for both same-system and networked play.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "October 31, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Gremlin Interactive", "publishers": "Gremlin Interactive", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/76997-vr-soccer-96\n"}
