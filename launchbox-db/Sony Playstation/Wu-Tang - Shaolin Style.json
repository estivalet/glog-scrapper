The basis for the game's story and setting is the real-life rap group the Wu-Tang Clan, featuring characters based on their stage personas and the martial arts themes of their music. Some members of the group also provided voiceover work for the game and made vocal and production contributions to the game's music. Wu-Tang: Shaolin Style uses the same engine created by its developer, Paradox Development, for their unreleased PlayStation title Thrill Kill. That game was noteworthy for allowing up to four players to fight simultaneously, a feature heavily utilized in Wu-Tang: Shaolin Style. Battle an evil warlord named Mong Zhu as members of the rap group Wu-Tang Clan in this 3D fighting game featuring nine playable characters. Master the martial arts as RZA, Method Man, Raekwon, GZA, Ol' Dirty Bastard, Masta Killa, U-God, Inspectah Deck and Ghostface Killa. The Story Mode starts you off in a courtyard area called the Hub, which resembles a city intersection with four separate alleys. Each alley leads to a fight against specific enemies from the Mong Zhu clan.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "October 31, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "M - Mature", "developers": "Paradox Development", "publishers": "Activision", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.57", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/11225-wu-tang-shaolin-style\n"}
