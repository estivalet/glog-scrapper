{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pet Pet Pet", "overview": "Pet Pet Pet is a mix between a virtual pet simulation and a strategy game. In the game the player is the owner of a pet shop in the town, he can buy new pets for the shop (the game features a lot of different animals from dogs, cats, rabbits, penguins, etc.) to different pet providers, and also can buy meals, toys, clothes for the animals that he can also sell in his shop. The most important feature of the game is that the player can follow the life of the different animals that he sells, for example if he sold a dog to a old woman he can anytime go to see the dog and play with him, teach him new things, etc. In that part of the game the game changes to a proper simulation game and there are different orders that the player can use. Other features of the game is that he can also train his pets in the shop before sell them, the player can also buy new buildings like hospital and other facilities to increase his pet emporium on the town. And anytime he can click over anyone in town to know the kind of pets that they prefer, etc.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "October 17, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Mahou", "publishers": "Magical Company Ltd.", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/111880-pet-pet-pet\n"}
