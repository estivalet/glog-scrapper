After having stolen the Death Star plans from a remote facility, he is tasked with investigating the sudden destruction of a hidden Rebel base. This leads him to face off against Imperial General Rom Mohc and the various iterations of his \"Dark Troopers\" - cybernetic soldiers with the armor and firepower to turn the tide of the war. Dark Forces is a close prequel to the original Star Wars movie trilogy. The game marks LucasArts' first attempt to enter the first-person shooter market. Instead of licensing the Doom engine, like many competitors, LucasArts created its own internal \"Jedi\" engine. The Jedi engine contains advanced features over similar tech, including the ability to look up and down, jump, crouch, and limited support (in the build used for Dark Forces) for rooms (sectors) over rooms. 3D models also make occasional appearances inside the game, as turrets or Kyle's ship dropping him off or picking him up from each mission.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "November 10, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "BIg Bang Software", "publishers": "LucasArts", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.91", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Dark_Forces", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5YjJsh6BEk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/11184-star-wars-dark-forces\n"}
