{"altername_name": [], "name": "Road Rash", "overview": "Electronic Arts' motorcycle racing series makes its PlayStation debut with digitized graphics, a licensed soundtrack, and full-motion video cut-scenes. The fourth entry in the franchise continues the point-to-point racing format of the Genesis games, with players knocking out rivals with fists, boots, or even pilfered weapons. Two play options are available to rambunctious riders: Thrash Mode and Big Game Mode. The former lets players enter a single race on their choice of courses and difficulty levels, while the latter is structured like a career. Big Game Mode involves selecting one of eight colorful characters and competing in a total of 25 races on five Californian courses: Sierra Nevada, Napa Valley, Peninsula, The City, and Pacific Highway.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "December 29, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Advance Technology Group", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.99", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_Rash_(1994_video_game)", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJ8bcjK7-3c", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/11374-road-rash\n"}
