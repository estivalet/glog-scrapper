{"altername_name": ["Kindaichi Shounen no Jikenbo - Hihou-tou Arata naru Sangeki"], "name": "Kindaichi Shounen no Jikenbo: Hihoutou Aratanaru Sangeki", "overview": "Kindaichi Case Files is a serialized Japanese mystery manga series based on the crime solving adventures of a high school student, Hajime Kindaichi, the supposed grandson of the famous (fictional) private detective Kosuke Kindaichi. They are written by Yozaburo Kanari or Seimaru Amagi (depending on series) and illustrated by Fumiya Sato. In 1995, the manga won the Kodansha Manga Award for shonen.The collected stories are published in English by Tokyopop with the title The Kindaichi Case Files. Kindaichi mysteries are whodunnit stories featuring (usually multiple) gruesome murders, often with a supernatural tinge. They are typically of the style of John Dickson Carr, and frequently feature a locked room mystery or other seemingly \"impossible\" crimes, such as a murder occurring when all surviving suspects have (apparently) airtight alibis. A notable distinction of The Kindaichi Case Files is that the killers are not depicted as psychopathic murderers and the murders are never committed for financial reasons alone. The identified killers all have deep rooted problems, often involving great emotional trauma through the greed or thoughtlessness of others, as their reasons for committing the murder(s). Thus the killers are often portrayed as sympathetic figures, as opposed to cold, calculating killers in some other mystery series. Hajime Kindaichi High school student Hajime Kinda'ichi is unmotivated, lazy, and a little lecherous, much to the exasperation of childhood friend Miyuki Nanase. However, only a few people see his great intelligence and deductive prowess by his 180 IQ, possibly inherited from his grandfather, private detective Kosuke Kindaichi. Miyuki Nanase is the childhood friend and next door neighbour of \"Hajime-chan\"; many question why a model student like Miyuki is friends with a slacker like him. Deep down inside, Miyuki feels Hajime is not an idiot, and they seem to have a love that neither has yet fully expressed.
