{"altername_name": [], "name": "Khamrai", "overview": "As suggested by the title, a creative spelling of Kamurai, or \"The Coming of God\", the world of Khamrai is a mystical place. A place where humans and gods live amongst each other, although the relationship between these two is anything but amicable. As such, the world of Khamrai is segregated into the six floating kingdoms of Fire, Giant Earth, Light, Growth, Doom, and Big Sky. In RPG tradition, the name of each floating nation is representative of the idealogy of its people. For example, those of Giant Earth are agriculturalists preferring to live as one with nature, and will do whatever is necessary both to preserve the land and their way of life. Similarly, the people of Light are philsophists and scholars, placing the greatest importance upon the pursuit of knowledge and greater understanding. The characters design are the handiwork of Haruhio Mikamoto of Macross fame.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "October 5, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Alpha-Unit", "publishers": "Namco", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109792-khamrai\n"}
