{"altername_name": [], "name": "Aubirdforce After", "overview": "Aubirdforce After is the sequel to Aubirdforce, a galactic war simulation which places mighty space cruisers and wingmen on a collision course with opposing forces across the cosmos. Attack, defend and outflank your foes to elevate yourself to supreme commander. Battles take place on 3-D grids which contain the tactical action. The game takes place 2 years after the events of the first Aubirdforce with a new enhanced graphic engine and the same complex gameplay of the first game. The thing that makes the Aubirdforce games a little different from other tactical RPG games is that the player can ascend or descend in the battle field.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "October 22, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bandai", "publishers": "Bandai", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/104525-aubirdforce-after\n"}
