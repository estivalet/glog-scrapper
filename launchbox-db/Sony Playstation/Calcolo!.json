{"altername_name": [], "name": "Calcolo!", "overview": "Birth to a new PS feeling soft puzzles and shooting things fell coalesced. Exhilarating thing in the shooting down while aiming for a large chain move in the shot destruction falling capsule, the capsule does not require a perfect blend of aggression and elaborate puzzle elements of shooting can be erased. Also appeared in a variety of items, but also features various modes. Calcolo! is a puzzle/shooter hybrid in the style of Twinkle Star Sprites. The game plays like a scrolling Puyo Puyo, except the player can shoot unneeded blocks and pull off a number of different flashy special attacks. A stacking puzzle that sees numbered balls tumbling from the heavens onto the players and opponents screen. These balls can then be shot at in order to rotate them and clear the screen. Very slickly presented with shoot em up style backgrounds and special moves that can help clear the screen in no time. An intriguing cross genre mix up.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "June 11, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Clef Inventor.", "publishers": "Clef Inventor.", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/92018-calcolo\n"}
