You must complete missions which range from collecting an object and getting out alive, to much harder and more complicated things. Your car is armed with many weapons including mines, rockets, lasers, smokescreens, and more. Then, if you get bored playing alone, you can eliminate your opponent in multiplayer missions where you have to destroy the other car, or a game mode called \"Pass the Bomb\", where you must pass the bomb to the other car by touching it before you blow up.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "November 21, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Eutechnyx", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.31", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/007_Racing", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYMKbIv_QJE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/11128-007-racing\n"}
