{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gaia Seed: Project Seed Trap", "overview": "Gaia Seed is a horizontally scrolling shooter from Techno Soleil. The game comes from the fabulous line of classically-styled Japanese shoot 'em ups, bursting at the seams with parallax scrolling, screen-filling bosses and other classic effects that you could count on from the games of this era. But the real beauty of GaiaSeed lies in its subtlety. The game has tight control, precise bullet collision, and a simple powerup system, while the haunting soundtrack stands out for its techno/ambiance mood, adding to the subliminal nature of the work.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Techno Soleil", "publishers": "Techno Soleil", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_Seed:_Project_Trap", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nz20vcWQP2g", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/71876-gaia-seed-project-seed-trap\n"}
