{"altername_name": ["King's Field II"], "name": "King's Field (US)", "overview": "Prepare yourself for an epic action-adventure never before imaginable. Only now, with the gaming power made possible by the PlayStation is a world as vast and detailed as King's Field a reality. This first-person game is completely rendered in beautiful 3D polygon graphics, with texture mapping and fully controllable 360\u00b0 viewing. Imagine a universe where you can travel freely - being able to look up and down, climb ancient ruins, traverse across oceans, jump off ridges, and duel enemies - all in real time, non-linear play. This visual world will not only astound you, but will pull you right into its universe. You will embark on a journey to an island of evil-ridden dungeons, villages, and castles as you seek the Moonlight Sword, which had been stolen by a cult of insidious worshipers of evil.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "December 31, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "FromSoftware", "publishers": "ASCII", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.44", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Field_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWSBYUPWMk0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/12209-kings-field-us\n"}
