{"altername_name": ["Sound Qube"], "name": "S.Q.: Sound Qube", "overview": "S.Q. - Sound Qube is a puzzle game released in 1998 for the Playstation & Saturn consoles. GAMEPLAY: You are armed with a RED and BLUE sonar. Each stage has a number of stacked cubes, visually they all look alike, but using the sonar you can find out whether the cube is RED, BLUE, WHITE, Core, or Jammer. To clear the stage one has to find the 'Core' cube and eliminate it. Fire a RED sonar using the 'circle' button and if the sound penetrates the cube with a 'swishing' sound, then the cube CANNOT be RED. If a 'do-in' sound echoes back, then the cube MAYBE of the RED. I say maybe because this cube can also be the all important 'Core' cube. To find out blast it with the BLUE sonar and if it echoes back the 'do-in' sound, then you have found the 'Core' cube. Eliminate by pressing the 'triangle' key twice and then press the 'circle' key. A WHITE cube lets pass both RED and BLUE sonar with a 'swishing' sound.
