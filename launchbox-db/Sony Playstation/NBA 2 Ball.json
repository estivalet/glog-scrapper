{"altername_name": [], "name": "NBA 2 Ball", "overview": "This unique mini game was given away to attendees of the 1998 NBA All-Star Game, letting them recreate the 2 ball competition held at that game. 2 ball is a competition for two players with a single net. Each player is given sixty seconds to take as many free shots as they can. There are seven positions marked on the court, each worth a different point value when a player sinks a shot taken from it; players can freely move between spots during play. The winner is the player with the most points once both players have taken their turns. 28 NBA teams are represented, with one player per team.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "1998", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Iguana Entertainment", "publishers": "Acclaim Entertainment", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137427-nba-2-ball\n"}
