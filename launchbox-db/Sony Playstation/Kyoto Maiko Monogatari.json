The game features 2D graphics, first person perspective & japanese voice acting in the video sequences. Maiko is a Japanese word for 'dancing girl' and is an apprentice geisha. A geisha is a traditional, female Japanese entertainer, whose skills include performing various Japanese arts, such as classical music and dance. It is the maiko, with her white make-up and elaborate kimono and hairstyle, that has become the stereotype of a \"geisha\" to westerners, rather than the true geisha. A woman entering the geisha community does not have to start out as a maiko, having the opportunity to begin her career as a full geisha. In fact, a woman above 21 is considered too old to be a maiko and becomes a full geisha upon her initiation into the geisha community. However, those who do go through the maiko stage enjoy more prestige later in their professional lives.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "June 21, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/135352-kyoto-maiko-monogatari\n"}
