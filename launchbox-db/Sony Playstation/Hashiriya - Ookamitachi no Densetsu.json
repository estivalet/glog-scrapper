{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hashiriya: Ookamitachi no Densetsu", "overview": "A neat drift-racing game ala Initial D that lets you choose among 15 cars and 5 courses. You can race against up to 5 cars in the arcade mode and there's also a story, time trial and practice mode (where you can train tricky parts of courses). Graphics and sound are passable but unremarkable (you can listen the 12 redbook tracks on your stereo) and the handling is a bit hard to get into at first as it feels a bit stiff with a digital pad. I'd recommened using the Negcon, which helps quite a bit. An obscure racing wheel, the \"Cockpit Wheel\" (SLHP-00024) is also supported. Sadly no multiplayer option, but all in all I'd say it's a nice little racer, albeit not quite up on par with the greats (Side by Side Special, Touge MAX G).", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "April 18, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Nichibutsu (Nihon Bussan)", "publishers": "Nichibutsu (Nihon Bussan)", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/97600-hashiriya-ookamitachi-no-densetsu\n"}
