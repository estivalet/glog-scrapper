{"altername_name": ["Clockwerx"], "name": "Clockworks", "overview": "The game is based in the PC game Clockwerx: A game designed by the team at Callisto Corporation and endorsed by Tetris designer Alexey Pajitnov, the game contains 100 levels to complete by moving, spinning, flipping, reversing, rotating, swinging, or bouncing your \"clock hand\" from dot to dot (or point to point) across a maze-like playing field. As you move your clock hand around the field of play, you'll have to avoid running into many obstacles. Spinning enemy clock hands, each with unique properties and movements, wait to destroy you. Spikes, walls, doors, switches, globs of oil, lighters, fuses, bombs, guns, triggers, bullets, a variety of deadly dots (death, way station, ring, moving, hyper, shields), and more will block your way to the goal dot. ClockWerx contains ten stages, each with ten progressively more difficult levels. Many options allow you to customize the game to personal preferences, including four levels of difficulty, two-person competition (each player has a moving clock hand and shares the same keyboard), time limits per session (between 5 and 55 minutes), and background music and sound effects toggles. Both mouse and keyboard input is supported. The game was released changing the hand for a character in the SNES, Saturn & PSX versions (these last ones with full motion sequences). There is also a 2 Players mode in which each player controls each own character and have to make them reach the goal on time.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "July 26, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Axes Art Amuse", "publishers": "Tokuma Shoten", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.42", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/92039-clockworks\n"}
