Its main feature is having a plot involving multiple mecha titles, allowing characters from different titles to team up or battle each other. The first game in the franchise was released for the Nintendo Game Boy in 1991 and later games are released on various consoles and handhelds. In most games, the player selects or is given a Banpresto original character and machine, who is connected to the overarching storyline which ties together the events of the constituent anime for the game. Some featured anime also has their plot intertwined: in Super Robot Wars Alpha, the White Fang from New Mobile Report Gundam Wing allies with Paptimus Scirocco's rebellion from Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam, resulting in the two enemy forces working together. The first mecha series featured are Mazinger Z, Getter Robo and the earliest incarnations of Mobile Suit Gundam. It was tradition for a Super Robot Wars game to include a Mazinger, a Getter and a Universal Century Gundam series, forming what fans call the \"Holy Trinity\"; however, newer handheld titles began omitting one or more of these series in favor of increased focus on newer properties. Since the second game, the series has also included a number of original characters and mecha designed specifically for each game. These serve as viewpoint characters for the player, who follows the events of the game through their perspective. Most games also will end with an original threat that may ally itself with other villains from the series' involved, and usually serves as the final villain(s) in the game. These heroes and villains are collectively knows as Banpresto Originals. Real Robots Final Attack was made by Sunrise in 1999. Game style is a blend between Super Robot Wars and the SFC's Mashoukushin (Lord of Elementals).
