{"altername_name": [], "name": "Brain Dead 13", "overview": "Brain Dead 13 is an animated adventure game that uses the same style of gameplay as Dragon's Lair and Space Ace. You play as Lance, a computer repairman who has been summoned to the castle of Dr. Nero Neurosis, a talking brain that lives in a vat of goo. There you are pursued by cartoon villains -- mainly Fritz, a half-man, half-animal henchman who has a ton of weapons in his overcoat and takes a lot of physical abuse. This is a point-and-click game where you have to consistently react in order to get yourself out of danger or you will be killed in some comically violent way.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "March 6, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "ReadySoft", "publishers": "ReadySoft", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_Dead_13", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CaPlENunDw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/11269-brain-dead-13\n"}
