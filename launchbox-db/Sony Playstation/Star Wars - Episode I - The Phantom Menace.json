Use the Force, and your wits, to overcome challenges at every turn as you plunge deeper into this story of a galaxy in crisis. In Episode I, Luke Skywalker's father is just a hopeful 9-year-old boy named Anakin, who knows nothing of his eventual fate as a Dark Lord in years to come. In this earlier time, Obi-Wan Kenobi is a determined young Jedi. Qui-Gon Jinn is Obi-Wan's venerable Jedi master, trying to teach the Jedi way to his apprentice as their world begins to unravel in political turmoil. Episode I will take audiences through extraordinary realms and adventures, from the desert planet of Tatooine to the galactic capital world of Coruscant (with its Jedi Temple), the green world of Naboo, and beyond.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "September 14, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Big Ape Productions", "publishers": "LucasArts Entertainment", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.68", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Episode_I_%E2%80%93_The_Phantom_Menace_(video_game)", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73vvhcMp1_E", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/9487-star-wars-episode-i-the-phantom-menace\n"}
