{"altername_name": [], "name": "Little Princess: Marl Oukoku no Ningyou Hime 2", "overview": "Little Princess: Marl \u014ckoku no Ningy\u014d Hime 2, also known as Little Princess: The Puppet Princess of Marl Kingdom 2, is a sequel to Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure. Unlike its predecessor, Little Princess uses a more traditional RPG battle system, but it still contains many of the same themes of love and music. Little Princess takes place years after the events of Rhapsody, where the protagonists of the previous game have settled down as the rulers of Marl Kingdom and now have a daughter, Kururu. Kururu gets entangled in a dispute between two families of witches, and must track down the pieces of a shattered gem. The battles follow a standard RPG battle system of enemies on the opposite side of the screen from the players and commands selected from a text menu. However, two of the characters have companion \"puppets\" that cast magic for them. The puppets level up along with the characters, and when a spell is cast, money is taken instead of magic points. The game was released twice; the first included a bonus disc of illustrations and a sound test, the second was a budget release.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "November 25, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Nippon Ichi Software", "publishers": "Nippon Ichi Software", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/31181-little-princess-marl-oukoku-no-ningyou-hime-2\n"}
