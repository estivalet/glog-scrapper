{"altername_name": ["Swing"], "name": "Marble Master", "overview": "\"Marbles with Attitude\" await gamers looking for logic, puzzle, and action-based gameplay in Elo Interactive's Marble Master. Players can play solo in four modes at three levels of difficulty in sudden death, mission, competition, or arcade, with the latter two modes available for two-player action. Gameplay features two types of marbles: normal and \"extras.\" The former are numbered to show the marbles' weight, while the latter are weightless animated marbles that perform special functions during the game. Marble Master provides more than 25 variations of marbles (e.g., crushers, bombs, jokers), each with a special power. Extras become steadily available as higher levels are attained, with the most powerful Flash Triangle marble (changes all marbles in a triangle to the same type) appearing at level 36. A special set of marbles is available exclusively for the arcade mode. See-saws, cranes, trios, combinations, closed circles, and more offer a myriad of gameplay styles, with options ranging from selection of various sets of marbles to screen and color effects.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "July 10, 2002", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Software 2000", "publishers": "Conspiracy Entertainment", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/-frw4AmRMeQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/20270-marble-master\n"}
