{"altername_name": ["Crossword"], "name": "SuperLite 1500 Series: Crossword", "overview": "A crossword is a word puzzle that normally takes the form of a square or a rectangular grid of white and black shaded squares. The goal is to fill the white squares with letters, forming words or phrases, by solving clues which lead to the answers. In languages that are written left-to-right, the answer words and phrases are placed in the grid from left to right and from top to bottom. The shaded squares are used to separate the words or phrases. SuperLite 1500 Series: Crossword is a crossword game that features more than 200 different crossword puzzles with different difficulty levels. Two more sequels were released in the SuperLite budget series, as well as a '3 in 1' compilation release.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "January 27, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Success", "publishers": "Success", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSvq2hwv-QU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/157439-superlite-1500-series-crossword\n"}
