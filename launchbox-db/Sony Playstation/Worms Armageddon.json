{"altername_name": [], "name": "Worms Armageddon", "overview": "Worms: Armageddon, developed by Team 17, is the sequel to the addictive strategy game Worms. In this game, you choose from either a single- or multiplayer game where you position your worm, select one of 60 weapons, and fire on your enemy. You can create your own battle or play on a randomly created stage. All stages include different landscapes with different places for your worms to hide and take up strategic positions from. There are over 40 single-player missions, ten of which are unique to the PlayStation. There are different strategies for playing Worms: Armageddon. You can choose to either kill everyone and everything with weapons such as Cluster Bombs, homing missiles, sheep, skunks, or the ever popular Bazooka. Others tend to go for the \"strategic\" method, utilizing options such as the Teleport, the Ninja Rope, the parachute, or the Pneumatic Drill. Choosing a method of strategy is important in order to gain success, and a different strategy can be used each time. You can also play in campaigns, matches or the all new training missions. Worms: Armageddon supports the Dual Shock Analog Controller and requires two blocks of memory.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "April 14, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Team17 Software", "publishers": "MicroProse", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.83", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worms_Armageddon", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05SbgPklysM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/5899-worms-armageddon\n"}
