{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bomberman Wars", "overview": "Bomberman Wars is an isometric tactical RPG, as opposed to the traditional top-down action/maze games in the franchise. There's a story mode, where the main character, King Bomber, rules over the kingdom, but has to fight off Bagular and his soldiers, in order to conquer all land. Gameplay-wise, the player controls the King and his knights, moving the characters around in a grid, with limited moves each turn, as is usual in tactical RPGs. This game is one of the first in the series to shift its main focus from multi-player to single player gaming. However, a versus mode is also available in addition to the story mode.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "April 16, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Metro", "publishers": "Hudson Soft", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.19", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomberman_Wars", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/22784-bomberman-wars\n"}
