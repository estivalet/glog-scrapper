{"altername_name": ["NFL Game Day 99"], "name": "NFL GameDay 99", "overview": "As the sequel to 1997's #1 selling football game for the Sony PlayStation, NFL GameDay 99 offers several new features designed to improve the gameplay as well as the presentation. First off, the 3D graphics have returned but with double the amount of polygons--bringing the total close to 350 per player. The animations have also improved to deliver one-handed spinning catches, lunges and off-balanced throws. A new zooming camera system will bring you closer to the on-field action, with player photos and statistical updates during the game. For the first time in the GameDay series, NBC announcers Dick Enberg and Phil Simms will provide the play-by-play and color commentary, respectively. Over 500 plays have been included along with thirty NFL teams and 1,500 players with ratings based on the 1998 season. The artificial intelligence has been refined to accurately model real-life defenses, with defensive backs backpedaling and shifting based on the player's offensive formations. NFL GameDay 99 also offers the following: the ability to create, draft, sign, trade or release players and free agents; four difficulty levels; three game styles (Arcade, Simulation and Total Control); multiple weather conditions; player injuries; complete statistical tracking during the 1998-99 season; and five game modes: Season, Preseason, Pro Bowl, Super Bowl and Playoffs.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "August 26, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Red Zone Interactive, Inc", "publishers": "Sony", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_GameDay_99", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O2InUvEeBE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/560-nfl-gameday-99\n"}
