Its intro video details the tournament's story, starting around the 1900s as a circus-type caravan that traveled across the country spreading destruction everywhere. A young Sweet Tooth finds himself amazed by the contest and runs off in its pursuit, entering and eventually winning. As his wish, he desires to become the star of Twisted Metal, which Calypso gladly grants. At first revered by the chaos he created, as time went on Sweet Tooth became jealous of Calypso, until he decides to initiate a coup d'\u00e9tat helped by a group of midget clowns, and takes control of Twisted Metal. It is also discovered that Calypso's source of powers comes from a mysterious ring that consumes the souls of those who die, increasing his strength and youth, and Sweet Tooth having taken it, finds that he possess the same abilities as Calypso to grant wishes. He tends to cheat people with their wishes like Calypso does as well.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "November 16, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "989 studios", "publishers": "Sony Computer Entertainment", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.46", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twisted_Metal_4", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejcJx64uFeg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/8962-twisted-metal-4\n"}
