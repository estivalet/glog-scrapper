{"altername_name": ["Independence Day: The Game"], "name": "Independence Day", "overview": "Independence Day envelops you in an interstellar war against resource hungry alien forces. Taking control of a hotshot fighter pilot and his wingman, Steve Hiller, your objective is to destroy a barrage of alien defense fighters while targeting massive battleships capable of obliterating entire cites. Needless to say, this won't be a stroll in the park. As a flight combat simulation, Independence Day features a wide variety of mission objectives and exotic locations. Because the alien forces have flocked to the Grand Canyon, you'll have to destroy four generators that supply power to the City Destroyer and incapacitate the massive spaceship. The New York mission will have you abolishing satellite linkups used by the aliens as a means of communication. Of course, you'll have to eliminate the primary spaceship in that area.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "February 28, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Radical Entertainment", "publishers": "Fox Interactive", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/11285-independence-day\n"}
