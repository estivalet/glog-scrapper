{"altername_name": [], "name": "TRL: The Rail Loaders", "overview": "TRL: The Rail Loaders takes place in a fantasy world in which the player (or players since the game features a 2 players cooperative mode) controls somekind of train machine that is alive and have to defeat different kind of monsters to release his land of them. The gameplay seems like a vertical shooter game since it seems like the player have to destroy the enemies, but this game is not like those games, the graphics is the only thing that is similar to them, since in this game the goal of each level is the reach the level boss and to do that the player have to advance through each level rails. Seems easy right? Well is not that easy during each level there are rails that leaves nowhere and most of the times the player's character have to go back into where a level is to push a lever and move to other place of the level, that won't be so much difficult but each level got a time limit to be complete so that's why the player have to choose his paths quick but carefully. In the 2 player mode the difficulty is even bigger since both players have to choose the right paths well. When the player arrives at each level ending boss there is no time limit and once the level boss is defeated the player can advance to the next level.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "April 6, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Victor Interactive", "publishers": "Victor Interactive Software", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/95726-trl-the-rail-loaders\n"}
