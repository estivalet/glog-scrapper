{"altername_name": [], "name": "True Love Story", "overview": "True Love Story is a series of four dating sims (as distinct from the similar but unrelated title True Love). True Love Story and True Love Story 2 were released by ASCII for the PlayStation. True Love Story 3 and True Love Story: Summer Days, and yet... were released by Enterbrain for the PlayStation 2. The True Love Story land are notable for their geko, or walk-home system. When the player asks a girl to walk home with him from school, the game enters a special conversation mode. In this mode, in addition to the usual long-term, strategic \"love meter\", the girl you are conversing with has a short-term, tactical \"heartthrob meter\" representing her level of immediate interest in the conversation with you. The player is given the choice of approximately 30 topics of conversation to choose from, and the heartthrob meter will increase or decrease based on the appropriateness of his selections. High heartthrob can then be leveraged to ask the girl out on a date, or simply to effect a permanent increase in her love meter. True Love Story is the first game in the True Love Stories series for the Playstation One console and the game is a dating simulation set in a Japanese high school where you must charm your way into the heart of Nozomi, Midori or even Saeko sensei!", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "December 13, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Bits Laboratory", "publishers": "Ascii Entertainment", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113180-true-love-story\n"}
