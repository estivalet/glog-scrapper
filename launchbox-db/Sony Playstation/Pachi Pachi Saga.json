{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pachi Pachi Saga", "overview": "Pachi Pachi Saga is a mix between a classic RPG game and a gambling game. The RPG part is in a classic 2d perspective and the player controls a group of characters that will start a dangerous journey. The battle part is in a first person perspective and the player select the kind of attack or defense that he wanted his character to do. The new part of the game is that isntead of earning money in the battles some things like the money and the experience grows when the player's character play a gambling pachinko machine, if he wins the money increases. The pachinko machines are japanese slot gambling machines used for amusement and prizes. Although pachinko machines were originally strictly mechanical, modern pachinko machines are a cross between a pinball machine and a video slot machine. There are many types of pachinko machines and parlor regulations, but most of them conform to a similar style of play. Players can buy metal balls by either inserting either cash, a pre-paid card, or their member's card directly into the machine they want to use. At 4 yen per ball that's 250 balls for every 1000 yen. These balls are then shot into the machine from a ball tray with the purpose of attempting to win more balls. The pachinko machine has a digital slot machine on a large screen in the center of its layout, and the objective here is to get 3 numbers or symbols in a row for a jackpot.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "April 26, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "TEN Institute", "publishers": "TEN Institute", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/136094-pachi-pachi-saga\n"}
