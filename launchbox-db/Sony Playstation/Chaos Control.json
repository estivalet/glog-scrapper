{"altername_name": [], "name": "Chaos Control", "overview": "The year is 2071, the aggressive Kesh Rhan aliens have already destroyed the human colonies on Mars and Pluto, and now plan to wipe out all humans from Earth as well. You play as Jessica Darkhill, lieutenant and most skilled pilot of the Orbital Defence Forces. The counter-attack you are about the launch is the last hope to save the Earth of chaos. Chaos Control is a sci-fi themed rail shooter which puts the player inside the cockpit of a fighter ship. Although the spaceship flight is automated, the player may target freely using an on-screen reticule, timing their shots so that the fighter's guns do not overheat. Targets across the game's four levels include mech suits, other spaceships and virtual reality constructs, most of which will return fire in an effort to drain the player's shields. There are no bonuses or re-charge power-ups for these shields, and play must restart from the beginning of the level if the player's ship is destroyed. Enemy positions are pre-determined and unchanging. This - in combination with fixed flightpaths - means that the player can seek to learn the game's deployment pattern for each level, defeating them through trial and error.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "April 10, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Infogrames", "publishers": "Virgin Interactive Entertainment", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.92", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/92024-chaos-control\n"}
