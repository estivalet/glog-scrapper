{"altername_name": ["\u304a\u5b22\u69d8\u7279\u6025"], "name": "Ojousama Express", "overview": "Ojyousama Express is an adventure game in which the player takes the role a young boy that takes a ride in the Ojyuosama Express (that is a luxury express that travels around different islands of Japan and the last stop is Tokyo), and during the game he will meet different passangers and train employees. Ojyousama is just one of those games that manages to stands out. Beautifully presented with nice animation, crisp speech, nice loading times and best of all, mini games including a horse racing game, slot, poker & black jack. During the travel, everytime that the train arrives at a station, the player can visit the town and talk to the other passangers that are also visiting the town. The idea of the game is that you board a train on for a little trip. However this is no ordinary trainsince it's entirely populated by sexy young ladies. Now you may be thinking how can you base a game on a train? Well, I though the same but it is actually quite interesting. Within the train there are many carriages to visit such as the buffet car, sleeping quarters or even an arcade. The game was also released on Saturn and features japanese voice acting for the game characters.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "July 30, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Media Works", "publishers": "Media Works", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%81%8A%E5%AC%A2%E6%A7%98%E7%89%B9%E6%80%A5", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/136087-ojousama-express\n"}
