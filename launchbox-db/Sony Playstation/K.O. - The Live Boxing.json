{"altername_name": [], "name": "K.O.: The Live Boxing", "overview": "KO The Live Boxing is the latest of the Japanese boxing games that combines the simulation aspects of Boxer's Road with the 3D action of Center Ring Boxing, The first thing is that the game is not just boxing, you can choose all your boxers stats (height, weight, looks, etc), and after that you have to train him in different ways. Another feature of the game is that you can ask the mafia for a loan, bet on illegal fights, etc. One nice play mechanic is that you can choose how hard to throw a punch by simply holding the button down longer. The longer the button is depressed, the harder the punch. The AI of the computer fighters is surprisingly good. They try to command the center of the ring and cut the ring off when you're trying to stay away. When a skilled computer opponent gets you trapped in a corner, he'll pummel you.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "June 4, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/135787-ko-the-live-boxing\n"}
