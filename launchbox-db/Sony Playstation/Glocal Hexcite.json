{"altername_name": [], "name": "Glocal Hexcite", "overview": "Glocal Hexcite is one of several conversions of the popular computer and board game. Players take turns placing shapes on a grid of triangles that make up seven hexagons. Any shapes placed on the board must touch the pieces already in play on at least one complete side; any outside hexagon completed will earn bonus points. If a player has any pieces left over at the end of the match that cannot be placed, they lose points for them. Matches are best two out of three. The PlayStation version of Glocal Hexcite features a story mode with a cast of cute characters, as well as a two-player versus mode and an \"Official Game\" mode where the rules are slightly different from the normal game.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "December 22, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Gu, Inc.", "publishers": "Locus", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/96492-glocal-hexcite\n"}
