{"altername_name": [], "name": "Fear Effect", "overview": "Your mission is simple, yet complex: investigate Wee Ming Lam's disappearance, track her down, and bring her back alive. She disappeared days before her eighteenth birthday; it is believed Wee Ming has fallen into the vice of Shan XI Protectorate, a hedonistic cultist group. Failure is not an option as she is the daughter of a powerful Triad leader, a predominant political force in Hong Kong. Mr. Lam has hired the services of three money-hungry mercenaries: Hana Tsu-Vachel, a young covert operative specializing in infiltration missions; the highly decorated ex-military officer Royce Glas; and Deke Decourt, a psychotically aggressive weapons expert with little knowledge of discretion. Together they will investigate the Lam family dynasty, infiltrate seedy criminal headquarters, and traverse through unimaginably horrific locations. Using a revolutionary Motion FX technology, Fear Effect is an action-packed third-person adventure through a streaming world filled with problem solving, unreliable sources, mystery and suspense. Whereas Resident Evil's pre-rendered backgrounds are static, Fear Effect utilizes streaming data for an alive, cinematic feel; steam spews from broken pipes and lights flicker on and off producing shadows and spotlights.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "February 24, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "M - Mature", "developers": "Kronos Digital Entertainment", "publishers": "Eidos Interactive", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.07", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_Effect", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRBmfRJkC8M", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/11274-fear-effect\n"}
