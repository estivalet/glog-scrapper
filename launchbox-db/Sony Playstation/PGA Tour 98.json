{"altername_name": [], "name": "PGA Tour 98", "overview": "PGA Tour 98 ups the ante for PlayStation golf games with five actual PGA Tour courses, including Pebble Beach, Colonial Country Club, TPC of Scottsdale, the Bay Hill Club and TPC at Sawgrass. Select one of 14 PGA pros to play as or against, or create your own golfer and edit the name, default animation and difficulty level. Before you set foot on the links, choose from eight different types of play: Practice, Stroke Play, Shoot-Out, Skins Game, Foursomes, Match, Four-Ball Match, Skills Challenge or a Tournament against fifty-eight PGA Tour professionals. The PGA series from EA Sports has been known for its options and this version is no different. Players are free to customize nearly every aspect of the game, from mulligans, handicaps, tap-ins, fairway conditions, greens conditions, wind strength, lie effects, camera views, to even the degree of caddie assistance for four different phases of the game. If you are familiar with other golf games, you'll know that most feature an arcing swing meter that you use to determine power and accuracy. PGA Tour 98 includes this as a default, but offers an arcade option which presents the swing as a vertical bar. Of course, you can still play for draw or fade or set the amount of backspin for whichever method you decide to use. Wrapping up the package is commentary by Ernie Johnson Jr., support for up to four alternating players, and all of your golfer's statistics saved to memory card.
