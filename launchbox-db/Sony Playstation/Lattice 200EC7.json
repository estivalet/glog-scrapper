{"altername_name": ["Lattice"], "name": "Lattice 200EC7", "overview": "Lattice 200EC7 is a first person perspective shooter in which the player controls a spaceship that have to clear each level to advance through the game. The gameplay is fast and to advance through the level sometimes have to destroy some enemies and that way part of the level will be opened. The gameplay is similar to games like Tunnel B1. Lattice is a high-speed abstract rail-shooter. The player constantly moves forward at a rapid pace along straight square pathways connected by junctions. Enemies and obstacles swarm from all sides, attacking or obstructing the player, which must either shoot and destroy them or avoid them by either moving to other sides of the path or jumping over them. The player can change their path through the stage at various junctions, as well as turn around and head the opposite direction if necessary. The goal of each stage is to locate and capture three \"key capsules\" within the time limit and without running out of life. As the stages progress, they become increasingly complex, introducing more branching paths and ways to traverse the paths such as the ability to jump to adjacent pathways. There are also a variety of special weapons that can be found. At the end of each stage, the player is graded on several criteria and given a score. Progress is saved using passwords. There are three difficulty levels, and seven stages in total.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "April 27, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nousite", "publishers": "HAMSTER Corporation", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/119272-lattice-200ec7\n"}
