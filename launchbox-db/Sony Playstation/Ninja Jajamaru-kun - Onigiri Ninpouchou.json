Jaleco then attempted to reimagine him in 3D for the 32-bit era for the Saturn and Playstation, with the subtitle \"Oni Killer Ninja Magic Scroll\". It actually looks very reminiscent of the N64 Mystical Ninja games. Like the old games, Jajamaru's main weapons are his shurikens, although he can also find a number of spells to attack all of the enemies on the screen and such Also, the Saturn version is technically an updated version, as it was released later, denoted by the \"kin\" after the name, meaning \"gold\". It has a map screen, where little old school sprites of Jajamaru, Princess Sakura, and the Catfish pirate show up.
