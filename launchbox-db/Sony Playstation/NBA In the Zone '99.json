{"altername_name": ["NBA Pro 99", "NBA Power Dunkers 4"], "name": "NBA In the Zone '99", "overview": "Konami returns to the world of basketball videogames with NBA IN THE ZONE '99, which includes all of the teams and players from the league. While all of the standard gameplay modes like Exhibition, Season, and Playoffs are included, two modes have been added: Slam Dunk Challenge and Three-Point Shootout. In the Slam Dunk Challenge, you choose the difficulty of your dunk and must memorize a series of button presses. The score for the dunk is determined by how well you recreate the button sequence. The Three-Point Shootout calls for you to stop a power bar in one of three locations to get the ball to go through the hoop. You have 60 seconds to shoot 25 balls, so you've got to be efficient if you want to win. No matter how you like your hoops action, you're sure to find what you want with NBA IN THE ZONE '99.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "March 31, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Konami Computer Entertainment Osaka", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.39", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_in_the_Zon", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXVYl7iQnlk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/77526-nba-in-the-zone-99\n"}
