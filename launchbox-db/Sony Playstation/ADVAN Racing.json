{"altername_name": [], "name": "ADVAN Racing", "overview": "ADVAN Racing is a Japanese racing game developed with the cooperation of ADVAN, a real extreme car competition in Japan. It features 16 cars taken from the real races, including both the roadsters and the rally cars. Atlus borrowed and improved some visual aspects from the cousin Gran Turismo, and many of the best racers are available right at the start of the game. The car views found in the game place are among the standard of the racing games, except for the in-car view, which features a generic dashboard with no steering wheel or dials. Game modes range from the simple exhibition racing to the official ADVAN GP. Multiplayer features one-on-one split-screen races.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "November 19, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atlus", "publishers": "Atlus", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.52", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcX2fIFkMI4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/30683-advan-racing\n"}
