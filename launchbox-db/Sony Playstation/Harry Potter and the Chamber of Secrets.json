Things do not go smoothly, however, as the game closely follows the events found in J.K. Rowling's second book in the international best-selling fantasy series. Harry Potter and friends Hermione and Ron must investigate a terrible danger: students are mysteriously turning to stone. Developed by Argonaut Software, this PlayStation version offers a completely different experience than the games on other platforms. Play begins at Ron's home at the Burrow, where Harry can practice his magic skills in a number of tasks designed to help the Weasley homestead.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "November 14, 2002", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Argonaut Games", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.90", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Chamber_of_Secrets_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAc8bW8G_lI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/12788-harry-potter-and-the-chamber-of-secrets\n"}
