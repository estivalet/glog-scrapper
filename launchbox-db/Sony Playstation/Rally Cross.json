{"altername_name": [], "name": "Rally Cross", "overview": "Looking for a rough time? Well, get ready for off-road racing with Rally Cross by Sony Interactive. Take on four obsessively tough computer opponents as you race around six of the world's most grueling rally courses. Blazing deserts, a rolling European countryside, stadium ovals and more will challenge your driving skills! Begin winning seasons and you'll eventually reveal 20 different vehicles, including four hardcore rally trucks (each with its own independent suspension, traction, speed, handling and acceleration) to tackle the competition. Add up to three of your friends in a PlayStation exclusive four-player mode, and you've got tons of mud throwing, fishtailing, and wreck inducing action. Try handling obtrusive weather and obstacle conditions such as snow, ice, sand, streams, mud, jumps, dirt and gravel. Rally style racing lets you perform power slides, end-over-end crashes, rolling your car, crashing into others and forcing cars off the road -- everything damages your vehicle! Compete in a season or tournament mode with three difficulty levels and four perspectives. So what are you waiting for? Rally on!", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "February 28, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Sony", "publishers": "Sony", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.05", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rally_Cross_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUKq1ta-aC0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/11352-rally-cross\n"}
