The game compares to Goldeneye on the N64. It's a shooter, but you must also use strategy. You have a health meter, so it's not a \"one shot and you're dead\" type of game. You must complete missions, or battle it out in a deathmatch with your friends, or enemies. The plot is about you having to prevent the sale of the Syphon Filter virus to a terrorist nation.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "March 14, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "M - Mature", "developers": "Eidetic", "publishers": "989 Studios", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.04", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syphon_Filter_2", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bzl81YPxfBA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/9070-syphon-filter-2\n"}
