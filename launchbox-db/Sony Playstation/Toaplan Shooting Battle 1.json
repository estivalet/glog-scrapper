{"altername_name": [], "name": "Toaplan Shooting Battle 1", "overview": "A dream compilation for shooter fans with three of the finest: Tiger Heli, Ultimate Tiger and Twin Cobra make up this bedazzling compilation with tough sounding names that would make an eighties car manufacturer whimper. Tiger Heli is the prequel to Ultimate Tiger and Toaplan show their flair for explosive onslaughts as players pilot the helicopter through 1942 style warfare based levels. Ultimate Tiger is a vertically scrolling helicopter based blaster like 1941 with copters for planes. Twin Cobra was actually the overseas version of Tiger Heli, thereby given the Japanese shooter crew the opportunity to sample some forbidden fruit without their passports. Being a Playstation release Ultimate Tiger is given an obligatory CG cut sequence. Twin Cobra follows up with more helicopters and, the clue being in the name, supporting two players. Toaplan once again showing its expertise in crafting very competent shooters. But there is no disguising this games hardcore shooter tattoos that would stop in getting into the modern era club.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "August 30, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gazelle", "publishers": "Banpresto", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.68", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/76309-toaplan-shooting-battle-1\n"}
