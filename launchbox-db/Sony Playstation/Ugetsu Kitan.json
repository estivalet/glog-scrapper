{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ugetsu Kitan", "overview": "Ugetsu is a point and click adventure game ported over from Japanese PC game software that was based on a novel. Ugetsu's graphics show their PC'ish origins with their digitized portraits of characters in games, the line art and somewhat also in the rigidity of the characters as they animate. There are many characters in this game with whom you can interact with so this should help keep the action interesting. The player controls a man who wake up in a hospital and climb to the roof and jump outside to suicide, but he returns to the building's roof and when he turns around he saw the spirit (or phantom) of a girl. He starts to chose that girl and the nightmare begins. The game is about going around a strange maze until he will reach the monster house at the end of the game and get a final meeting with the girl.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "July 5, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Will", "publishers": "Tonkin House", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113207-ugetsu-kitan\n"}
