{"altername_name": ["Kisya de Go!"], "name": "Kisha de Go!", "overview": "Where the Densha De Go! simulators featured modern trains, this simulator goes back in time and features a few different Japanese steam locos. Kisha de GO! is part of the Densha de GO! series by Taito. This game lets you drive steam locomotives through the Japanese countryside. The coverage includes portions of the Keihin-Tohoku Line, Shinetsu Main Line and Banetsu-Sai Line. Controls are somewhat more difficult than usual for the Densha de GO! series to reflect the simulation of steam engines. These are harder to drive than the modern trains, as these have poor brakes and you have to keep the fire burning and watch the water level in the boiler. This edition features popular classic steam locomotives, such as the C57 180, D51 498, and the C58 363. It is also one of the few games in the franchise to allow for 2-player gameplay.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "March 23, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Taito", "publishers": "Taito", "genres": "Vehicle Simulation", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.12", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/122892-kisha-de-go\n"}
