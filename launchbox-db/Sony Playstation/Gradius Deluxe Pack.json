{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gradius Deluxe Pack", "overview": "This pack contains both the arcade classics Gradius I and II, ported to Windows 95, Sony Playstation and Sega Saturn. Story: The Bacterians are attacking the planet Gradius, and in a state-of-the-art fighter ship you have to stop them. Both games have similar gameplay and graphics, with only different music and level layout setting them apart. Each of these side-scrolling shooters has over a dozen levels each, all of which are completely unique. There are no enemy types that are re-used from level to level (except for the boss who is the same in every level). You can collect powerups that provide things like extra speed, laser shots, target-seeking missiles, shields, etc. While there have been many small modernising touches made to the games, there is still no ability to save. Be prepared to set aside a considerable amount of time to finish in one go.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "March 29, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.11", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradius_Deluxe_Pack", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/24879-gradius-deluxe-pack\n"}
