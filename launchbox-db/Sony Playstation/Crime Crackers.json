In an effort to stop intergalactic crime, the \"Galaxy Police\" were born and they are also known as GG, or the Galaxy Guard. While the GG is somewhat successful in their efforts to prevent criminals from plundering the valuable resources of the universe, some jobs are just too big for them to handle.Here's where you come in; you control the team of wacky heroes who take care of the jobs that even the GG can't deal with.
