{"altername_name": [], "name": "Star Trek: Invasion", "overview": "The Borg are once again invading Federation space. Their target? Sector 001, Earth. You are part of an elite flying team known as Valkyrie squadron, commanded by none other than Lieutenant Commander Worf of Star Trek: The Next Generation fame. You'll fly through different territories and encounter familiar races from the popular television series, including Klingons, Romulans, Borg and a new enemy known as the Kam'Jahtae. There are twists and turns throughout the game as you protect convoys from enemy attacks, engage galaxy class starships, and go on solo retrieve and rescue missions. The storyline is accented by the voices of actors Patrick Stewart (Captain Jean-Luc Picard) and Michael Dorn (Lieutenant Worf). Your ship is outfitted with phaser cannons and photon torpedoes, both of which you will have to master in order to succeed in your battles with enemy crafts. Users can play from a view behind their ship or from a first-person view inside the cockpit. The game supports analog control as well as force feedback, and uses up one block of memory on the standard PlayStation Memory Card to save progress.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "November 2, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Warthog", "publishers": "Activision", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.54", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Invasion", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGupeXm3lIY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/13122-star-trek-invasion\n"}
