{"altername_name": ["Kyuin"], "name": "Kyuiin", "overview": "Two kids are cleaning their room when they find a book of fairy tales. Suddenly a fairy pops out of the book and tells them about an evil wizard who is tampering the fairy tales. Hopping on the vacuum cleaner the kids travel to the fairy land to help the fairy. Kyuiin is a horizontal shoot-'em-up set in a fairy tale world. The players control a boy (and a girl in 2-player mode) who flies around on a vacuum cleaner fighting an array of fairy tale characters like Snow White, The Big Wolf, Frog Prince etc. In addition to a standard primary attack there is an ability to suck up certain enemies and projectiles into the vacuum thus building up a special power. Once activated this special power sends back all enemies that have been sucked in into a beam of energy and it grants a short period of invincibility. There is also a backfire cannon helpful against enemies attacking from the left side of the screen. If the boy is hit once he loses all his weapon upgrades, and a second hit destroys the boy.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "May 31, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Media Entertainment", "publishers": "Media Entertainment", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/32990-kyuiin\n"}
