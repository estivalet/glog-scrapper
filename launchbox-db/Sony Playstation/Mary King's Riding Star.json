{"altername_name": ["Riding Star", "Ulrich Kirchhoff's Riding Star"], "name": "Mary King's Riding Star", "overview": "Mary King's Riding Star is a managerial simulation set in the equestrian sports business. The game focuses in the athletic part, this means there are no finances to manage and the goal of the game is to win as many championships as possible in the events dressage, cross country and showjumping. To achieve this goal the player has to \"manage\" his horse by using the training grounds to improve the horses's skills. The player also has to manually clean the stall and feed and groom the horse. The championships are shown in a isometric perspective with spoken commentary. There are options to personalize the game, e.g. by naming the horse and choose its color. The game is largely based on the original 1998 Riding Star and was created in cooperation with its developer Blue Tongue.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "April 12, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Interactive Entertainment", "publishers": "Midas Interactive", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/92710-mary-kings-riding-star\n"}
