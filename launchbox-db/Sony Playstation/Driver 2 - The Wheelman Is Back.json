The action takes you to Chicago, Las Vegas, Rio and Havana, all of which are depicted in detail, with curved roads added from the first game. As before, you have full control over the car as it storms around the streets. A new feature is the ability to get out of the car, and carjack others. This is especially useful when you have fallen victim to the advanced damage modeling. There is a full sequence of missions to complete, as well as some pre-set challenges and a Free Driving mode allowing you to explore at your leisure.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "November 13, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Reflections Interactive", "publishers": "Infogrames", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.2", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driver_2", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ri-N4qqR-x8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/499-driver-2-the-wheelman-is-back\n"}
