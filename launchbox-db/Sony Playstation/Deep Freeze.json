{"altername_name": [], "name": "Deep Freeze", "overview": "In the 21st century terrorist is the world's first menace. For that reason the United Nations created a special unit to fight against terrorist groups, that unit is called ANTS. The game starts in New York where a wedding takes place in the floor 58 of a building, and one group of the terrorists enter the building disguises as food deliverers (they hide the weapons inside the meat). The other terrorist group break inside the wedding and kipnapped the people (the vice-president was one of the guess). That's when the game starts: You control Jack & you have to choose between one of the other four members of the team (Harry, Snipel, Bagel & Maria). After you had made your choice you will start on the floor 56. Gameplay: You can run pushing a buttom (a flag on the floor guide the road), and use the weapon pushing other buttom. When an enemy appears the character will point his gun against him (and the other member will shoot againts him too) and you have to shoot at him. There are a lot of enemies in each floor and the gameplay is similar to games like Die Hard or Resident Evil.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "January 14, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Sammy Studios", "publishers": "Sammy Studios", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.58", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/95790-deep-freeze\n"}
