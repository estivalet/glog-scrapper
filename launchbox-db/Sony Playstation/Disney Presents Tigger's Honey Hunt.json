{"altername_name": ["Disney Tigger tras un Bote de Miel", "Disneys Tiggers Honigjagd", "Disney's Tigger's Honey Hunt"], "name": "Disney Presents Tigger's Honey Hunt", "overview": "There's simply not enough honey for Pooh to have a proper party, and Tigger's the only animal in the 100 Acre Wood who can help! Control Tigger as he bounces from place to place, collecting as much honey as he can get his paws on. Of course, it's not all as easy as it sounds; slippery ice, dangerous bees, scary bats, and other environmental concerns will follow Tigger throughout his adventure, and there also dark caves and falling boulders to contend with! Intended for children ages four and up, Tigger's Honey Hunt has nine action-packed levels to master, and each features bold, colorful graphics that will have little ones giddy with excitement. Three mini-games allow players to earn the Accordion Leap and Tigger-tastic Bounce two maneuvers that will help procure Pooh's \"most-favorite\" snack. Packed with beloved characters from A.A. Milne's classic tales, this is one game that anyone can enjoy.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "October 10, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Doki Denki Studio", "publishers": "Mattel Interactive", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.06", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7HMLzYaCn4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/18129-disney-presents-tiggers-honey-hunt\n"}
