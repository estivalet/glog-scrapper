{"altername_name": ["Denki Groove Jigoku V: SweepStation Version"], "name": "Denki Groove Jigoku V", "overview": "In 1998 Sony released a music game for the PlayStation produced by techno outfit Denki Groove called Groove Jigoku V. The game is a collection of different mini games. Then you go see the Beit Devil. He gives you a random selection of minigames, or rather part time jobs, to play. I think there are several of them, Some are unlockables. Many of them are just one button. They all got sharp 2D bizarre graphics, usually either in a spare geometric style, or using digitized images, and have clear button control diagrams. The game got a sequel in PSP called Beit Hell 2000. The game is also known as Denki Groove Jigoku Five.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "January 8, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Opus", "publishers": "Sony Music Entertainment", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/93823-denki-groove-jigoku-v\n"}
