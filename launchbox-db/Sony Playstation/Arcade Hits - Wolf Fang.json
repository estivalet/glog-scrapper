{"altername_name": ["Wolf Fang: Kuuga 2001"], "name": "Arcade Hits: Wolf Fang", "overview": "Two years have passed since the military occupation of New York City in 1999 and since then Ragnarok (aka: DAGGER) - the organization responsible for the events - have disappeared following their air borne destruction. During that time, mech technology has been the boom of future military projects worldwide with the biggest factories residing in Oceania. These mechs become the main target of Ragnarok when it resurfaces and claims the military factories and cities of Australia and New Zealand. Their plan is to apparently use any and all of the deadliest mechs that have not yet reached completion to their chaotic liking. The USAF and RAAF organize a strike force to reclaim major attacked points in the two countries with the assistance of the best mech operators they can find. Players then assume the role of mech-fighters who aim to liberate Australia or, depending on the player's actions, New Zealand.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "May 10, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tsuji Jimusho", "publishers": "Xing Entertainment", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.17", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf_Fang", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBlajB-Eb-I", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/159461-arcade-hits-wolf-fang\n"}
