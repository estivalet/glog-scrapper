{"altername_name": ["Knight & Baby"], "name": "Guardian's Crusade", "overview": "Guardian's Crusade starts off innocently enough: The mayor wants you to deliver a letter to a nearby town, and being a fine young knight, you agree and head on your way. But how could you know that you are taking the first step on a grand journey that will decide the fate of the entire world? On your way back from the town, you discover a pink monster known as Baby and receive an ominous message about a place called God's Tower. Taking care of Baby is just one of the many problems you'll face as you fight the forces of evil. The game is categorized as an RPG, but it includes unique features, including the capacity to change how Baby reacts in battle depending on how you treat him throughout the game, and the inclusion of 70 Living Toys, non-player characters which you collect throughout the game. These toys have special abilities like ninja skills and healing, which can help you in battles. Guardian's Crusade is compatible with analog and Dual Shock controllers and requires one free block of memory.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "January 31, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Tamsoft", "publishers": "Activision", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.85", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guardian%27s_Crusade", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/11982-guardians-crusade\n"}
