Hanafuda are playing cards of Japanese origin (karuta cards), used to play a number of games. The name literally translates as \"flower cards\". Cards: There are twelve suits, representing months. Each is designated a flower, and each suit has four cards. Typically, there are two 'normal' cards worth one point, one poetry ribbon card worth five points, and a final special card worth ten or twenty points.
