{"altername_name": [], "name": "SuperLite 1500 Series: Slither Link", "overview": "Slitherlink is played on a rectangular lattice of dots. Some of the squares formed by the dots have numbers inside them. The objective is to connect horizontally and vertically adjacent dots so that the lines form a simple loop with no loose ends. In addition, the number inside a square represents how many of its four sides are segments in the loop. Other types of planar graphs can be used in lieu of the standard grid, with varying numbers of edges per vertex or vertices per polygon. These patterns include snowflake, Penrose, Laves and Altair tilings. These add complexity by varying the number of possible paths from an intersection, and/or the number of sides to each polygon; but similar rules apply to their solution. SuperLite 1500 Series - Slither Link is a puzzle game based on the Slitherlink logic puzzle featuring over 200 different stages. The game is based on a puzzle/board game of the same name, which was developed by Nikoli.
