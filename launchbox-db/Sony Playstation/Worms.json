{"altername_name": [], "name": "Worms", "overview": "Worms is a turn-based strategy game. It features up to 4 teams of 4 worms, aiming to destroy the others on a generated terrain. Each worm has 100 hit points, and dies when his hit points fall to 0. Upon death, a worm explodes, causing damage to everyone around. Gameplay is turn-based. Each turn, the player can control one specific worm from his team. The worm can crawl left and right or jump. However, there is a time limit to make a move; also, if the worm falls from a great height, it loses health and the turn ends immediately; and if a worm falls into water or offscreen, it dies. Each turn, a worm can also make a single attack: the player can aim up and down, choose a weapon and then fire it. After attacking, the turn ends.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "December 10, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Team17 Software", "publishers": "I'Max", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "16", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.74", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worms_(1995_video_game)", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtOQFJjHUJE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/11210-worms\n"}
