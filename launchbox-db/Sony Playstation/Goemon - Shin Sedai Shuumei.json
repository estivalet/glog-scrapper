{"altername_name": ["Goemon: The Successor for a New Generation"], "name": "Goemon: Shin Sedai Shuumei", "overview": "Goemon: Shin Sedai Shuumei! is the fourth & last game in the Goemon series for the Playstation One console after \"Oedo Daikaiten\", is a total change of style in the series, since this time the game takes place in the future and the main characters had also changed. The 4 main characters of the game are: Goemon, Ebisu, Sasuke & Yui. The game is set in the future and Goemon and his friends are bounty hunters that got to go to several towns where they will receive the wanted jobs. The places are mountains, cities, woods, mines, ice places, etc. At the beginning of the game in the first intro they received orders from a man in shadows that seems similar to Konami's classic Goemon character. The gameplay is similar to other 2D side-scrollers in the series, with you controlling each character as they jump around the obstacles in each level and defeat the baddies within using unique weapons and abilities to each character. The non-linear \"world map\" sections have been removed and all of the power-up buying and upgrading now takes place in the platformer stages themselves. While the gameplay is completely 2D, the game engine mixes polygonal elements and sprites to render specific bosses and background elements as well as bring to life the Goemon Impact sequences (in which you have to take control of Goemon's giant mecha in shooter sequences). The game also includes pre-rendered cutscenes and cel-animated sequences.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "December 20, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.04", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/81995-goemon-shin-sedai-shuumei\n"}
