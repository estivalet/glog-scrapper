{"altername_name": ["Bishi Bashi Special"], "name": "Bishi Bashi Special 2", "overview": "The second one in the Konami Bishi Bashi series for PSX.Includes the minigames from Hyper Bishi Bashi Champ and Gachaga Champ. Bishi Bashi Special 2 brings more of the mini-games that are a staple of the series. This is a collection of the arcade games Hyper Bishi Bashi Champ and Gachaga Champ bundled into one game, which only saw a Japanese release. The mini-games themselves are very straightforward and usually involve using only the Triangle, X, and O buttons. This is a direct holdover from the original layout of the arcade machines, which only featured a three button layout. In the console release there is sometimes the option to use the analog stick or the D-pad as well to increase the button-mashing even further. Examples of these types of games (timing vs. mashing): in one game the player has to fend off mobsters by pressing the button placed in the direction they're coming from and in another the player simply has to mash buttons as fast as possible to run towards a soccer goal while trying to time jumping over the opposing team's players. The games can either be played alone, against a computer player, or with a friend.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "February 9, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami Computer Entertainment Sapporo", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21994-bishi-bashi-special-2\n"}
