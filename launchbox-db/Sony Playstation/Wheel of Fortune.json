{"altername_name": [], "name": "Wheel of Fortune", "overview": "The famous wheel finally spins its way onto the PlayStation in this translation of the hit television game show. Wheel of Fortune features video clips and speech of host Vanna White (Pat Sajak is not included) as up to three players compete for cash and prizes. Games can be customized to last 15 minutes, 10 minutes, 20 minutes, or between three to five rounds. A new twist comes in the form of the Solo Game, which allows you the chance to play without other contestants stealing your thunder. The catch is that you only have eight turns before the game ends. For every incorrect guess, bankrupt or lose-a-turn space you land on, you're forced to use one of your remaining free spins.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "December 15, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Artech Studios", "publishers": "Hasbro", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "3", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/11226-wheel-of-fortune\n"}
