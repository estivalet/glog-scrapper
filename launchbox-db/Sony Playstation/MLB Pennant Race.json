It also contains quick play, season and home run derby as well as the option to play playoff games or to go straight to the World Series. As a fully licensed game, it contains the real uniforms, logo and players and statistics based on the actual characteristics. Despite being released late in 1996 however, when the baseball season was already over, all the information still refers to the 1995 season. Commentary is done by Jerry Coleman.
