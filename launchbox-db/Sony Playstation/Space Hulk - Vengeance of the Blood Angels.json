{"altername_name": [], "name": "Space Hulk: Vengeance of the Blood Angels", "overview": "Space Hulk: Vengeance of the Blood Angels is a part tactical strategy and part first-person shooter. You must embark on a campaign to board a Space Hulk and eliminate its deadly cargo. While you begin the game as a rookie, you will eventually command a team of your own, issuing orders on the overhead tactical screen to carry out the mission at hand. Once finished, the game will switch to a first-person perspective looking through the visor of your Tactical Dreadnought armor. Missions range from sealing off doors to prevent Genestealers from escaping to placing explosive charges in key sectors, or carrying specific objects from one part of the ship to another. You'll also have to be on the lookout and protect your team from five types of enemies: pure-strain Genestealers, Hybrids, Magi, Patriarchs and Chaos Space Marines. Should any member of your squad perish, you'll have to continue the next mission shorthanded!", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "July 1, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Key Game", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.69", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Hulk:_Vengeance_of_the_Blood_Angels", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQGpDD1FeNw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/13139-space-hulk-vengeance-of-the-blood-angels\n"}
