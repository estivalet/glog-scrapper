The game is set in some cities of the United States. The player takes the role of a driver that wants to become the winner of the Zero Championship. To do that and advance through the game he will have to choose what to do each week & talk to different characters: Friends, Drivers mates, rivals, mechanics, etc. The player can buy different parts to tune his car in the garage and earn money competing in races against other drivers. The racing part is in third person perspective and is really difficult to win is the car is not well tuned. The main part of the game is to become the championship (the Ranking A championship takes place in New York), but there are other events that happens during the game but are not important for the main story. The game features 2 game modes: Story mode and vs mode", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "June 20, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Media Rings", "publishers": "Media Rings", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/95864-zero-4-champ-doozy-j\n"}
