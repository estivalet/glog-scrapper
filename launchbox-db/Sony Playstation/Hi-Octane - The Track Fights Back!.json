{"altername_name": ["Hi-Octane", "Hi-Octane"], "name": "Hi-Octane: The Track Fights Back!", "overview": "Hi-Octane is a racing/vehicular combat video game released in 1995 for the PC, PlayStation and Sega Saturn, developed by Bullfrog. The game offers a choice of six hovercraft vehicles differentiated by their top speed, armour, firepower, weight and appearance: KD-1 Speeder, Berserker, Jugga, Vampire, Outrider, and Flexiwing. There are six tracks to race on, with names like New Chernobyl which hint at a dystopian futuristic world (although the game does not feature a backstory). The tracks offer different difficulties, various textures and types of landscape like wastelands and city streets. Certain parts of the track allow to recharge vehicle's fuel, shields or ammo, although the vehicle has to slow down in order to fully benefit of the recharge. There are also power-ups on the tracks, recharging fuel/shield/ammo (10, 100 or 200%) or upgrading the car's minigun, missile or booster, for more power. Other parts of the tracks changed in the course of racing, opening shortcuts or places with scattered upgrades for a short time.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "December 29, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Bullfrog Productions", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.65", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hi-Octane", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOEozcuLm-U", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/32248-hi-octane-the-track-fights-back\n"}
