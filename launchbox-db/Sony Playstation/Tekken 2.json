{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tekken 2", "overview": "The gameplay in Tekken 2 is much like its predecessor with a few additions. It continues to use 2D backgrounds in its stages, an infinite playing field, and a fighting system that utilises four buttons: left punch, right punch, left kick, and right kick. Distinct additions included attack reversals for some characters, back throws, chain-throws, and a sidestep unique to two characters, Kazuya Mishima and Heihachi Mishima; However, Yoshimitsu has a spinning sidestep move that lowers his health. Tackles were also modified to inflict damage when running from a greater distance. Each time the game is beaten with one of the default available characters in arcade mode, the associated sub-boss character becomes selectable.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "August 27, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Namco", "publishers": "Namco", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.07", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tekken_2", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jABsofDHDj0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2479-tekken-2\n"}
