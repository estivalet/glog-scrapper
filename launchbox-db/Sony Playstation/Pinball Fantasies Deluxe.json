{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pinball Fantasies Deluxe", "overview": "After the success of Pinball Dreams on several systems, a sequel featuring four new tables was created. The gameplay is much the same as the first game, with realistic physics, multi-player options and a high score table to aim for. The tables are Partyland, Speed Devils, Billion Dollar Gameshow and Stones 'n' Bones, taking in a funfair, racing cars, a tacky game-show, and a graveyard. Each one has a range of ramps, combos, light sequences and targets to shoot, as well as general themes which are less influenced by real tables than those in Pinball Dreams. Pinball Fantasies Deluxe was published exclusively in Japan by VAP in 1996, which also includes the Pinball Mania tables but these have to be unlocked first.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "October 25, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Spidersoft", "publishers": "Vap", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "8", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinball_Fantasies", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/132127-pinball-fantasies-deluxe\n"}
