{"altername_name": [], "name": "V.I.P.", "overview": "Based on the syndicated series starring Pamela Anderson, V.I.P. for the PlayStation offers a mixture of first-person shooting action and hand-to-hand combat. The female bodyguard team led by Vallery Irons is entangled in a mob vendetta while protecting their client Dr. Kindle. After Irons and Kindle are captured, the rest of the team must advance through a series of indoor and outdoor levels to rescue them. Featured characters include ex-spy Tasha Dexter, explosives expert Nikki Franco, former boxer Quick Williams, martial arts specialist Johnny Loh, and computer hacker Kay Simmons. Fighting sequences are controlled differently than in traditional fighting games, as players perform combination attacks by inputting a series of onscreen commands. If the sequence is entered within the time frame, the character will carry out the moves and damage the enemy. Play then continues until all the enemies in a level are defeated. The shooting stages are structured in a manner similar to Lethal Enforcers or Time Crisis, with players guiding a cross-hair target on the screen to shoot down enemies. Ten mini-games are also available in between missions, offering a variety of timed puzzles to complete before advancing to the next stage.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "November 10, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Kalisto Entertainment", "publishers": "Ubi Soft Entertainment Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.06", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/12971-vip\n"}
