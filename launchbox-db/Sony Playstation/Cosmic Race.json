{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cosmic Race", "overview": "Cosmic Race is a 3D racing game with flying vehicles. The goal is simple: follow the course and beat the opponent to the goal without blowing up. Crash into too many obstacles, or leave the course for too long, and it's game over. There are four different stages, each with multiple course variations, for a total of 33 different courses. There are five different vehicles to choose from, each with a different top speed and damage limit, and four different game modes: single-player campaign, single-player time attack, two-player versus, and a two-player tag battle. The ten best times for each course are saved, and replay videos can also be saved to watch later.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "January 20, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Neorex", "publishers": "Neorex", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_Race", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/92044-cosmic-race\n"}
