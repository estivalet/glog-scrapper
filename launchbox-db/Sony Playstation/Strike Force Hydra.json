{"altername_name": [], "name": "Strike Force Hydra", "overview": "Strike Force Hydra is a vertical-scrolling shooter with eight levels of combat set on the ocean, desert, jungle, and the Ice Kingdom of Brotherhood. As the pilot of a sleek hovercraft armed with the latest in technology, players must either engage or avoid enemies in the air, on the ground, and in the water. Forty-five types of enemies are featured in total, ranging from gun turrets to bombers, but players have the ability to jump for a short distance or use a temporary speed boost to escape from harm's way. Standard armaments include heat-seeking missiles and twin cannons, with additional weapon power-ups found at various points along the waterways. Each multi-stage level culminates in a boss encounter that must be defeated in order to advance.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "January 8, 2004", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ignition", "publishers": "Ignition Entertainment", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/114910-strike-force-hydra\n"}
