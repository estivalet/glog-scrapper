Then Ken (who is retired in a cave) is attacked by an henchmen of this martial arts school. After defeating him, Ken decides to investigate. The player watches the development of plot in long Anime-like cutscenes and takes an active role only during the simple turn-based battles. The player chooses his actions from a menu. A time bar marks the flow of the turns. When the battle is won, another cutscene starts, etc. The game is divided in levels and a password is given after beating each of those.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "August 30, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Natsume", "publishers": "Banpresto", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.38", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/24881-hokuto-no-ken\n"}
