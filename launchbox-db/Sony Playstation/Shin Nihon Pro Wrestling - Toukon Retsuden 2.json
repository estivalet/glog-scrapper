{"altername_name": [], "name": "Shin Nihon Pro Wrestling: Toukon Retsuden 2", "overview": "Shin Nihon Pro Wrestling - Toukon Retsuden 2 is the sequel to one of the most popular wrestling games ever made. Although it was altered when the American version was made (under the name of Power Move Pro Wrestling,) the game still maintained its wonderful polygon graphics, large range of moves, and smooth game control. What the game lost in its American version, was actual wrestlers. The American game took such wrestlers as Masahiro Chono, Shinya Hashimoto, and Jyushin \"Thunder\" Lyger, and turned them into wrestlers such as Area 51, Da Judge, and King Og. The new game has all of the old favorite wrestlers, plus new wrestlers like Chris Benoit, Tiger Mask, and Antonio Inoki. Tag Team and Battle Royal modes have also been added. New moves, arenas, and new situation moves (like running tackles) have added to the game.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "December 20, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Yuke's", "publishers": "Tomy", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/112309-shin-nihon-pro-wrestling-toukon-retsuden-2\n"}
