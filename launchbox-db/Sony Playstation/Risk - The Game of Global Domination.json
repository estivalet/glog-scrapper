{"altername_name": ["Risk", "Risiko"], "name": "Risk: The Game of Global Domination", "overview": "Aspects of the classic game, like building armies and seizing territories, are brought to life through animation and graphics. The version also offers a variation on the classic game, titled Ultimate Risk, which further enhances gameplay by including weather, terrain, POWs, and more, features not possible with the limitations of the board version. These features add a new dynamic to the already challenging game by forcing users to consider alternate strategies from the original board game version. Five maps are available for strategizing, including the classic world map with six continents and the American map, with 14 additional countries and 153 territories. If playing the classic version, players choose from three varying game objectives. In World Domination, the last player standing wins the game, while the Capital Risk module establishes a goal of conquering the opposing player's secretly designated capital. The last objective, Mission Risk, involves completing a mission designated by drawing a random card.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "May 31, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "BlueSky Software", "publishers": "Hasbro", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.55", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/11370-risk-the-game-of-global-domination\n"}
