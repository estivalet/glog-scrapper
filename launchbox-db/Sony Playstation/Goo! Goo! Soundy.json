{"altername_name": [], "name": "Goo! Goo! Soundy", "overview": "Goo! Goo! Soundy is sort of like a do-it-yourself Dance Dance Revolution game. You supply the music via your own audio CDs and the game will generate Step charts. You can then dance along with a mat or use a controller. There appears to be a sort of \"virtual pet\" style twist added on too. You can pick an avatar who can learn new dance moves and eventually transform into new forms. The game can be played with the Dance Dance Revolution Dance Mat.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "September 22, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Music", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.36", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/96538-goo-goo-soundy\n"}
