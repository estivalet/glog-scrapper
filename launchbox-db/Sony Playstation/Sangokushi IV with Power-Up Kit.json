Infighting among the court families and the emergence of powerful warlords dominates the landspace. The struggle for power has brought an era known as the Three Kingdoms, complete with constant warfare among China's most courageous and skillful heroes. As a ruler during these difficult times, it's up to you to unify a country torn apart by rebellion. Expand your kingdom by building a strong military or try outsmarting your rivals during negotiations. With exciting new weapons including automatic firing crossbows and catapults, you can engage your opponents out in the open or from behind castle walls.
