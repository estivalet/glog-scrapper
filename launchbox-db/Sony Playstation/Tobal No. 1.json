{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tobal No. 1", "overview": "Fighting game with a unique quest mode, from Square. The publisher enlisted the help of Seiichi Ishii, who had previously worked on both Tekken and Virtua Fighter. On these strengths, Square helped Ishii start his own development company, Dream Factory, and Tobal No.1 is the first game from the developer. The game offers some 3D movement for more behind-the-back attacks that fighting games released around the same time. Tobal also introduced an interesting grapple move, which allows you to grab your opponent and, depending on your button execution, throw them in a myriad of ways. The game features Gouraud-shaded players displayed in hi-res mode (640x480) and shipped with an included Final Fantasy VII demo.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "August 2, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "DreamFactory", "publishers": "Sony Computer Entertainment", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.54", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobal_No._1", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jkepOmipBU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/3492-tobal-no-1\n"}
