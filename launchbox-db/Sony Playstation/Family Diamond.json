{"altername_name": ["Hop Ching Checkers"], "name": "Family Diamond", "overview": "Family Diamond is a very basic digital version of Chinese checkers. The goal (just like in the board game) is to move your marbles across the board to the opposite site and, if possible, use you opponents' marbles to get further each turn. This game has no extras or special effects, it's just good old fashioned board gaming. You can play alone or against a friend and face computer opponents.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "January 24, 2002", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Imagic", "publishers": "Magnolia", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/110374-family-diamond\n"}
