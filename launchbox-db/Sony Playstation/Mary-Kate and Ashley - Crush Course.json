{"altername_name": ["Mary-Kate & Ashley: Crush Course"], "name": "Mary-Kate and Ashley: Crush Course", "overview": "Mary-Kate and Ashley compete in a series of school-related activities to reveal their secret admirers in the aptly titled Crush Course for the PlayStation. As either Mary-Kate or Ashley Olsen, players decide on one of four outfits to wear before venturing off to school. The \"courses,\" or activities, are spread across three halls, two of which are locked until the first is completed. The object is to earn a specific number of points in each activity to receive one of the pieces of a torn love letter. Only by completing all activities in a given hall will the twins be able to determine which boy has a crush on them. Activities include miniature golf, rhythm-based games involving cheerleading and dance, shooting hoops, an underwater matching game, baseball toss, snapping photos of classmates, and rescuing marine life. Once players have gone through the single-player game, they can ask a friend to join the fun in a separate mode featuring many of the same activities, including miniature golf and shooting hoops. Players can also scroll through the potential dates, learning more about each boy's favorite music, food, hobby, and place to hang out. Progress during the adventure can be saved to memory card.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "October 31, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "N-Space", "publishers": "Acclaim Entertainment", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.11", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Mary-Kate_and_Ashley_video_games", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHKQcDlGB08", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/77222-mary-kate-and-ashley-crush-course\n"}
