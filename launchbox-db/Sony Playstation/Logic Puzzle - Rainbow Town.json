{"altername_name": [], "name": "Logic Puzzle: Rainbow Town", "overview": "Logic Puzzle Rainbow Town is a digital version of the classic nonogram style puzzles, in which the player must use numerical clues to deduce the arrangement of squares on a grid and create a picture. The game features three types of puzzles: Monochrome puzzles use only a single color, Color puzzles use multiple colors, and Rainbow puzzles use three single-color layers -- red, blue, and yellow -- which overlay to form a full color image. Puzzle sizes range from 5x5 all the way up to 30x30. The game map is made up of numerous locations, each of which represents a building in the titular Rainbow Town and contains a set of puzzles. Each building, such a concert hall, insect museum, or game development studio, contains puzzles in multiple sizes themed to that location; the concert hall for instance has puzzles that look like musical instruments, while the game studio has puzzles representing other Human-developed games. As the player completes more puzzles in a location, that building develops and gets larger and more extravagant; the goal is to clear all the puzzles and bring each building to maximum development. There is also an edit mode where custom puzzles can be made and saved.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "March 8, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Human Entertainment", "publishers": "Human Entertainment", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/136998-logic-puzzle-rainbow-town\n"}
