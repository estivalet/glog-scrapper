The Earth's only hope is the Aegis System, which could shield the Earth Sphere from the shock wave. Unfortunately, the heroes are sent to an alternate future, where the Earth has been ravaged by the wave. Faced with a new threat in the form of the Ancestors, the heroes must find a way to return to their time and prevent this alternate, dystopic future from happening.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "March 29, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Banpresto", "publishers": "Banpresto", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.54", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Robot_Wars_Alpha_Gaiden", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foKqeSYVdDk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/19392-super-robot-taisen-alpha-gaiden\n"}
