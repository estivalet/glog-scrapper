{"altername_name": [], "name": "Slamscape", "overview": "SlamScape is a 3D shooting game set in a surreal world of bomb-throwing ferris wheels, deadly teddy bears, exploding balloons, bottled brains on unicycles and a Scary-Go-Round, a spinning seagull named Gullicopter, a monstrous creation called Crabzilla and other bizarre enemies. Your objective is to pilot a rocket-mounted pile driver called a Slamjet while shooting, blasting, smashing and jumping anything and everything you see throughout four dangerous regions. Derived from your subconscious, the regions contain four heavily guarded Orb-Ids needed for level progression. Once obtained, you'll then take the orbs to a central location within that level. You must employ a different strategy for each orb you wish to obtain.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "October 15, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Viacom New Media", "publishers": "Viacom New Media", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.38", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/11391-slamscape\n"}
