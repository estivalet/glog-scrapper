{"altername_name": [], "name": "Shin Super Robot Taisen", "overview": "Shin Super Robot Wars features full-sized graphics (besides Super Robot Wars Gaiden: Maso Kishin / The Lord Of Elemental and the Scramble Commander games, this is the only title to do so), as well as the debut of the \"Banpresto Original\" SRX storyline. Series Premiered: Blue Comet SPT Layzner, Super Electromagnetic Machine Voltes V, Demon Dragon of the Heavens Gaiking, Invincible Robo Trider G7, New Mobile Report Gundam Wing STORY: The game begins when the military has detected a large energy signature - far *too* large. The source becomes apparent quickly: one of the colonies around Mars just exploded. And what's worse, more colonies are under attack from beam cannonry borne by unknown flying adversaries. In short order, the entire constellation of Martian colonies is wiped out, and the commander runs off to make his report, yelling to his subordinates not to take their eyes off the unidentified enemy. Some observers thinks to themselves that, had they but a little more time, Earth's warpower could have been organized to combat this threat. They had apparently anticipated this threat, but not a threat this threatening - is resistance, in fact, futile? Will the enemy even accept a surrender? With so little time to choose, they have to bet on even the smallest ray of hope - and they have to buy time, enough to steal the adversaries knowledge and technology. That's the only option open for mankind, or at least one of theobservers thinks.... to the other's protests, the first observer notes that the Earth will surely fight this threat, until at last mankind is utterly destroyed. These men cannot afford to let that happen, and the leader orders the other to call \"him\". He tells \"him\" that while he understands his feelings, he needs \"him\" to go to the Earth to help fight the Zanskull Empire. An unidentified flying object is heading towards Earth - and this is an age when no flying object should be unidentified. The men of the Far East Earth Defense Base contact the object, which doesn't respond to their hailing. It's due north, and headed straight for Japan... On the beach, Rilina finds a man in a space suit, rather unconscious and apparently some kind of soldier. She hastens to call an ambulance, but Hiiro regains consciousness, only to find in horror that Rilina has seen his face. Hiiro resolves to kill her, which may be a somewhat tall order ;) Rather than do it on the spot, he carjacks the ambulance and speeds off, leaving Rilina to introduce herself to... thin air. The flying object is still approaching, and Professor Hamaguchi orders his men to their stations. He tells his men, the Voltes Team, that as they are now their defeat at the hands of the enemy is certain: only by Volting In can they win! Unfortunately, that's easier said than done, especially with the enemy approaching. Ken'ichi's mom takes things into her own hands, piloting her machine and shooting at the enemy. She sacrifices herself in short order [and what jaunty music too!], apparently to motivate her sons and their teammates to actually Volt In.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "December 20, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Winkysoft", "publishers": "Banpresto", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/31170-shin-super-robot-taisen\n"}
