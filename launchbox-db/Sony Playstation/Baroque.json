{"altername_name": ["Baroque: Yuganda Mousou"], "name": "Baroque", "overview": "The Armageddon came. A huge Heat Wave ruined the planet, humans have mutated into strange creatures who worship strange gods, trying to exterminate each other in bloody wars, and Ikei demons populate the surface of the planet. In the middle of the wasteland stands the Nerve Tower. Nobody knows what it is: the symbol of evil or the final hope for salvation, because nobody ever dared to enter it. But the hero of the game is determined to explore the tower, and perhaps to cleanse the world of evil once and for all. Set after a world-altering cataclysm called the Blaze that took place on May 14, 2032, Baroque focuses on a nameless, mute, and amnesiac protagonist. Early on, he finds himself tasked with purifying the Meta-Beings, once-human creatures that have lost themselves to the delusions inside them, and reaching the bottom floor of a tower to gain redemption for his forgotten sin. Through his interactions with the other characters and unlocked cutscenes, the player learns about the back-story and characters.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "October 28, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sting Entertainment", "publishers": "Sting Entertainment", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.71", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baroque_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/91656-baroque\n"}
