{"altername_name": [], "name": "X'treme Roller", "overview": "Race in a futuristic tournament of more than 30 stages against up to three computer opponents, experiencing dizzying speeds, acrobatics, and grind stunts. You will earn credits to upgrade your skates by impressing the crowd with your daring. You play as one of two characters, Blakki and Mae Wing, students whose priority is to pass their exams but whose passion is to beat Big Buzz, the current world champion. You will be able to interact with many objects on the tracks, and you can customize your skates (wheels, roller bearing, fixtures, etc.) Each character has unique looks and qualities: speed, weight, agility, and balance. The 33 included stages offer a variety of competition styles: time trial, race, stunt competition, and bump match. There is a tournament mode for one or two players, played with a split screen. Twelve stunts include some drawn from actual inline skating competitions, such as backsides, cowboy grinds, and Halley hoop ricko.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "October 24, 2002", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Titus", "publishers": "Microids", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.42", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/91399-xtreme-roller\n"}
