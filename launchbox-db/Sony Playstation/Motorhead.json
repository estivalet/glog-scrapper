{"altername_name": [], "name": "Motorhead", "overview": "Motorhead is a futuristic racing title featuring a total of ten playable cars on eight twisting courses, ranging from an industrial area to a desert. Each vehicle is individually rated in speed, acceleration, and grip. There are no weapons or power-ups to collect; it's just you, a friend, or the computer competing for the fastest time. Four play modes include Time Attack, League, Head-to-Head, and Single Race. Each mode offers the option to view the action at 30 or 60 frames per second, with the key difference being the number of computer-controlled cars on the track.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "September 30, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Digital Illusions", "publishers": "Fox Interactive", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.56", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorhead_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/18606-motorhead\n"}
