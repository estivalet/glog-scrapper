{"altername_name": [], "name": "NBA Hoopz", "overview": "Rather than 5 on 5 action like professional play, this game features 3 on 3 play. Using players from the NBA, each player chooses a guard, forward, and center from the team's NBA roster for the first half and can make substitutions for the second half. NBA Hoopz is an arcade-style game and not meant to be realistic: players can jump twenty or thirty feet in the air, dunk the ball from 20 feet (6.1 m) away, and do otherwise physically impossible things. Fouls are only called on flagrant pushes, foul shots are rare (and only after a number of fouls are accumulated), and there is no out of bounds. In addition, after a player makes three consecutive shots he becomes \"on fire\" which allows him to make almost any shot as well as goaltend without penalty. The PlayStation 2 and Dreamcast versions accommodate up to four players.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "February 17, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Eurocom Developments", "publishers": "Midway", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "6", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.96", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Hoopz", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4HIo0XSD8o", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/77171-nba-hoopz\n"}
