{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dancing Stage Fusion", "overview": "Dancing Stage Fusion, abbreviated DS Fusion or simply Fusion, is a music video game released by Konami to the European PlayStation and PlayStation 2 gaming audience on November 5, 2004. In April of the following year, Dancing Stage Fusion was released as an arcade game. Fusion featured new gameplay features such as EyeToy support for the PlayStation 2 release as well as new music from hit pop artists. The arcade version of Fusion was the first arcade machine in Europe since Dancing Stage EuroMix 2 and set a milestone as the first Dance Dance Revolution arcade machine produced by Konami since Dance Dance Revolution Extreme in 2001. The arcade release marked a total game engine upgrade from the old PlayStation-based boards to a new system built on top of an off-the-shelf PlayStation 2. This hardware upgrade would be later featured in the global release of Dance Dance Revolution SuperNova in 2006. The following three lists are playable songs in each respective version of Dancing Stage Fusion. They are ordered as they appear in game (much like a music album) and color coded according to color coding in game. Yellow represents licensed music, white represents Konami Originals (music developed within Konami by their own in-house artists), and blue represents Boss Songs (DDR terminology for the hardest songs available). The soundtrack of the PlayStation Dancing Stage Fusion release is a cut down list of the music available on the PlayStation 2 version. None of the songs contain Freeze Arrows and there are no unlocks.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "November 5, 2004", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Music", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/95784-dancing-stage-fusion\n"}
