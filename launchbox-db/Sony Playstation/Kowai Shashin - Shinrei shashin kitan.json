{"altername_name": ["Kowai Shashin", "Kowai Shashin: Tales in Spirit Photography"], "name": "Kowai Shashin: Shinrei shashin kitan", "overview": "Kowai Syasin Shinrei Syasin Kitan is a curious action game (similar in the action part to Fatal Frame in the Playstation 2) in which the player takes the role of a young spirit hunter that receives different missions through letters that the people send to her that contains different photographs that got evil spirits inside. To catch those spirit first she has to use his powers to detect in which parts of the photographs they are (the point of the gunsight will change to red where there are the spirits) and after that the game changes to cast an spell and to do that the player has to press a combination of buttons in 3 or more times and if he do it well the spirit is catched. The difficult part of the game is find the spirits in the photograph since the spiritual energy of the player's character that is shown using a candle will decreased when she uses her powers and specially when she is near where the spirit is. Curious and entertainment game for sure, and deserves a try.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "July 25, 2002", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Media Entertainment", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.79", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/130605-kowai-shashin-shinrei-shashin-kitan\n"}
