{"altername_name": [], "name": "Zill O'll", "overview": "Zill O'll is a classic rpg game released in 1999 for the Playstation console. The player can choose the gender and initial status of the main character. The game's plot is linear but the player's action can make it takes different ways. Even the same event can be seen by different perspective depending of the players choice and the same for the characters relationships. Instead of Experience Points, Zill O'll features a Soul Points System. After each battle the player can freely allocate the Soul Points earned to the different parts of the character's status, like Bravery, Kindness, Curiosity, and others. When characters earn enough Soul Points, they will receive one of the 32 Soul Powers, which give the character special abilities. Another innovation is the Fast Break Bonus. The faster you finish off the enemies in a battle the more money and items you collect. Finally, the Elemental System will allow characters to gain experience in the opposite element when they defeat an elemental enemy. For example, defeating a fire enemy will earn water element points. The game got a sequel in the Playstation 2 console with the name of Zill O'll Infinite.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "October 7, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Team Infinite", "publishers": "Koei", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/82137-zill-oll\n"}
