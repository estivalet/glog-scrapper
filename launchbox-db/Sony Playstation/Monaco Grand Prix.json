{"altername_name": ["Monaco Grand Prix Racing Simulation 2", "Racing Simulation 2"], "name": "Monaco Grand Prix", "overview": "The sequel to F1 Racing Simulation recreates the 1997 season, featuring 17 authentic tracks, 11 teams and cars with their 22 drivers. The Monaco license is used, although the teams themselves are not licensed. A total of 22 camera views are provided. Telemetry is stored and analysed in a similar way to Grand Prix 2, and physics are modeled to be realistic. There are eight different modes to race, the new ones being a career mode in which you start with a poor team and must drive well enough to earn competitive rides, and scenarios recreating key races for particular drivers. Returning from the first game are Time Attack, a full championship, and a 50s retro mode. There is also a track editor to create your own tracks.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "July 15, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Ubi Soft Entertainment Software", "publishers": "Ubi Soft Entertainment Software", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.68", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78958-monaco-grand-prix\n"}
