{"altername_name": ["Our Graduation - Mahjong de Pon! Hanafuda de Koi!"], "name": "Ma-Jyan de Pon! Hanahuda de Koi! Our Graduation", "overview": "Mahjong is a game for four players that originated in China. It was called, meaning sparrow in ancient China, which is still the name most commonly used in some southern Chinese dialects such as Cantonese and Minnan, as well as in Japanese. However, most Mandarin-speaking Chinese now call the game m\u00e1 ji\u00e0ng. Mahjong involves skill, strategy, and calculation, as well as a certain degree of luck (depending on the variation played, luck can be anything from a minor to a dominant factor in winning). In Asia, mahjong is also popularly played as a gambling game. In the game, each player is dealt either thirteen or sixteen tiles in a hand, depending on the variation being played. On their turn, players draw a tile and discard one, with the goal of making four or five melds (also depending on the variation) and one pair, or \"head\". Winning comes \"on the draw\" by drawing a new or discarded tile that completes the hand. Thus, a winning hand actually contains fourteen (or seventeen) tiles. Hanafuda are playing cards of Japanese origin, used to play a number of games. The name literally translates as 'flower cards'. There are twelve suits, representing months. Each is designated a flower, and each suit has four cards. Typically, there are two 'normal' cards worth one point, one poetry ribbon card worth five points, and a final special card worth ten or twenty points. The point values could be considered unnecessary and arbitrary, as the most popular games only concern themselves with certain combinations of taken cards. Ma-Jyan de Pon! Hanahuda de Koi!
