{"altername_name": [], "name": "Vs.", "overview": "Each fighter is a member of one of four different gangs whose turf must be protected at all costs: Streets, Beach, Campus and the Hood. Vs. is notable for its 60 frames per second action and lack of a jump button, so prepare for straightforward one-on-one fighting across twelve different locales: Venice Beach, Playground, Vacant Lot, Disco, Construction Site, Chinatown, Subway, Rooftop, Library, Stadium, Malibu Canyon, and Miami Beach. Game modes include One or Two-Player Versus, One or Two-Player Rumble (one gang takes on the others one after another), Survival (fight everyone in your gang), Challenge, and Exhibition (computer fights itself). Fights are won by depleting as much of the opponent's life meter as possible within sixty seconds. The game also features alternative music (including vocals) from artists Razed in Black, Los Infernos, Suicide Machines, and Pigs in Space.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "November 30, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "PolygonMagic", "publishers": "THQ", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.08", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/12918-vs\n"}
