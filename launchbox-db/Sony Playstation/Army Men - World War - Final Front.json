For the first time in the series, each of the included vehicles is within your complete control allowing you to command tanks, motorcycles, submarines, boats, and more. It's all about the modes of transport this time around, as the little plastic soldiers have given up on the hand-to-hand stuff. There are 31 all-new levels to get you fired up, letting you wage war on land, above water, and under the ocean's surface. There are plenty of unique single and dual-player modes to keep you battling it out, and with 16 two-player scenarios in all, you're sure to develop some bad blood with your best friends. A Co-op mode, Grudge Matches, and the unique Steal the Bacon setup allow for maximum competition, and a Boot Camp gets your little green and tan man ready for battle.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "February 27, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "3DO", "publishers": "3DO", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.78", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_Men:_World_War_-_Final_Front", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/93575-army-men-world-war-final-front\n"}
