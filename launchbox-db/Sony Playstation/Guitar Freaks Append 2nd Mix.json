{"altername_name": [], "name": "Guitar Freaks Append 2nd Mix", "overview": "First introduced in the arcades as an enhancement to the popular Konami simulation game, \"2nd Mix\" updates the musical library with a total of 45 tracks ranging from flamenco to fusion rock guitar pieces. It requires the original Guitar Freaks disc, as well as near-mastery of the original game. Each mode start out with 16 tracks right away instead of 6 in the original. The layout for song selection is a little different in that the song titles appear horizontally on a menu and you select them by scrolling up and down. You have a guitar controller, which consists of three colored buttons at the top, and a small flipper placed where you would normally pick the strings. Guitar Freaks has a vertical bar staff that consists of three bars, color-coded to coordinate with the buttons on the guitar. As the notes reach the top of the staff, you must strum on the guitar while holding the coordinating button.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "February 24, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Music", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/97589-guitar-freaks-append-2nd-mix\n"}
