{"altername_name": ["Apocalypse: Protagonizado por Bruce Willis"], "name": "Apocalypse", "overview": "Players assume the role of Trey Kincaid, a nano-physicist played by Hollywood action star Bruce Willis. And darn it if he isn't the world's only hope; he has been called upon to defend the world, destroy the Four Horsemen, and thwart the Reverend's plans. Apocalypse's goal is a simple one: progress throughout multiple levels and destroy, kill, and exterminate any and all resistance. Played from a third-person 3D viewpoint, Kincaid can maneuver in a 360-degree rotational manner; this is very important as the action takes place on all sides.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "November 17, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Neversoft Entertainment", "publishers": "Activision", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.89", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalypse_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IfxePPhFTU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/10594-apocalypse\n"}
