This time twenty vehicles are available to choose from, but before you can get behind the wheel, you'll have to purchase them with credits earned from winning races. Some of the licensed vehicles include a Hummer, Dodge Ram, Jeep Wrangler, Ford Explorer, Jeep Cherokee, Range Rover, Ford F-150 and a Dodge T-Rex. The World Tour consists of five events divided by class: Hummer, Safari, SUV (Sport Utility Vehicle), Truck and Military.
