On the nearby planet of Neptune, forces of evil have initiated their new plans to invade the Earth. By accelerating sub-atomic particles around a tubular shaped circuit known as The Torus, they are developing a race of Super Warriors. Together with advanced genetic engineering, this central birthing canal is capable of producing an army of lethal genetically mutated insects. Nitrous Oxide, a pollutant by-product emitted inside The Torus, provides a high octane fuel for your Tunnel Runner, but unfortunately it also provides the perfect breeding environment for the secretly incubating species.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "June 30, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Gremlin Interactive", "publishers": "Fox Interactive", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.15", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N2O:_Nitrous_Oxide", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ohp3Ix_KWww", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/11219-n2o-nitrous-oxide\n"}
