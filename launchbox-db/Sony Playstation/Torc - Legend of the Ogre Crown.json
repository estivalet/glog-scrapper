{"altername_name": [], "name": "Torc: Legend of the Ogre Crown", "overview": "Once the Orcs sneaky people stole precious stones from the Holy Crown. Angry they decided to take revenge on all life. Using an enormous wheel with thorns and other heavy weapons, the orcs make their way, crushing people and destroying cities. The player is in the center of a large spiked wheel that rolls across a variety of landscapes (forests, mountains, valleys, etc.), destroying everything in its path. Hence the name \"Murder Wheel\", more precisely this name was a game in the development process, which must be said and was never completed, but nevertheless got to the players, albeit in an unfinished form and under a different name, namely - Torc : Legend Of The Ogre Crown. The goal of the game is to score more points (within the allotted time limit) and move to the next level. And although the game seems, at first glance, even primitive, numerous obstacles and enemies, as well as a \"fight\" with inexorable times create a certain interest. The game was not officially published for any of the regions and is not included in the product catalog of SONY.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/84290-torc-legend-of-the-ogre-crown\n"}
