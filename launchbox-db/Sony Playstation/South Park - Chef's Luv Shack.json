{"altername_name": [], "name": "South Park: Chef's Luv Shack", "overview": "Chef hosts this Acclaim title, which mixes South Park trivia with mini games in the mold of Mario Party (Nintendo 64). The idea is you choose your favourite South Park kid (Kyle, Kenny, Stan or Cartman) and answer the questions based on episodes from the cartoon series. If you get it right, you then spin the wheel, and you either get the cash, lose it all, or play a mini game (either by yourself, against the AI, or against your friends if you're in multiplayer mode). The person who has the highest score (or the most correct answers) after a chosen amount of rounds wins.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "October 31, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "M - Mature", "developers": "Acclaim Studios Austin", "publishers": "Acclaim Entertainment", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.11", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Park:_Chef%27s_Luv_Shack", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/11177-south-park-chefs-luv-shack\n"}
