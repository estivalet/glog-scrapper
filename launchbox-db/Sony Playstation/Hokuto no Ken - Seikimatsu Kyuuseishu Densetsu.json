The exact date is unimportant, and most probably unknown, because civilization has been all but destroyed by nuclear war. Earth is now a barren wasteland, replete with marauding mohawked motorcycle punks. With the loss of advanced weapons and technologies, these brigands wield power through the use of martial arts whose ancient secrets give them mystical abilities. Into this lawless nightmare strides a living engine of Justice: Kenshiro, master of a secret martial art called Hokuto Shin Ken. Ken eradicates any evildoers he comes across when they prey upon the weak. Kenshiro discovers that his fianc\u00e9e Yuria has been kidnapped by Shin, master of Nanto Seiken. The Savior of Century's End begins his journey in search of his love Yulia. Waiting for him is Raoh, who styles himself the Supreme Ruler of the Century's End.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "October 26, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bandai", "publishers": "Bandai", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.24", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/14704-hokuto-no-ken-seikimatsu-kyuuseishu-densetsu\n"}
