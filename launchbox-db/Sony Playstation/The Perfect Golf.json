{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Perfect Golf", "overview": "The Perfect Golf distinguishes itself from all previous console golf games by offering 101 (yes, that's 1-0-1) authentic Japanese courses to play on. Choose from four male or four female players, each differing in power and shot tendency, or customize your own character. You'll be able to edit the golfer's name, appearance, handicap (from one to forty) and shot tendency, which determines the ball's trajectory after contact is made. You can also adjust each club's maximum shot distance and the golfer's starting tee position to improve your performance out on the links. Play involves selecting a club, adjusting your stance, and setting the power, point of impact, and direction of your shot while accounting for wind. All of these steps are performed manually before the golfer carries out the shot. A Japanese female caddie will comment on your performance from time to time, offering such phrases as \"good shot,\" \"nice par!\" or \"nice approach\" whenever your game warrants some praise. The Perfect Golf also lets up to four players (there are no computer opponents) participate in one of three game modes: 1-Hole Play, 9-Hole Play and 18-Hole Play. Players can then save and resume their progress with an optional memory card. The game features also the advice mode by Hiroshi Tahara.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "December 1, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "SETA", "publishers": "SETA", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/111877-the-perfect-golf\n"}
