{"altername_name": ["Casper: Reise um die Welt"], "name": "Casper: Friends Around the World", "overview": "Casper's friends have been hexed by an evil spell! The king of ghosts has created an imprisoning device that sends them to different locations across the globe. You must help Casper rescue his friends, but you only have the first ten map pages. If you can find the rest, they will each lead you to a friend. Collect the pieces of the device that sent your friends away by defeating three evil bosses. If you can manage to find everything in the game, then you'll advance to a special level in the lost city of Atlantis. Watch out for your uncles and tourists, though, because they will make your journey most difficult. Make Casper jump on umbrellas and trees to reach high places, while using his special ability to levitate to avoid pitfalls and water. You can also make him turn into a parachute to glide down to the surface and duck to avoid flying objects. Ghostly Spheres can be thrown to eliminate apparitions and pumpkin bombs.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "November 16, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Realtime Associates", "publishers": "Sound Source Interactive", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.23", "wikipedia": "https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casper:_Friends_Around_the_World", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q6sgfGSjO4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/11788-casper-friends-around-the-world\n"}
