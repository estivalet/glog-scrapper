{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gionbana", "overview": "Gion Hana or Gionbana is a hanafuda first person game that was previously released in SNES and arcade machines. The Playstation version features new graphics and 2 different modes (story and vs). There are 12 different characters to play against and 2 main characters (a male and a female one) to play with. Hanafuda are playing cards of Japanese origin (karuta cards), used to play a number of games. The name literally translates as \"flower cards\" Cards: There are twelve suits, representing months. Each is designated a flower, and each suit has four cards. Typically, there are two 'normal' cards worth one point, one poetry ribbon card worth five points, and a final special card worth ten or twenty points. The point values could be considered unnecessary and arbitrary, as the most popular games only concern themselves with certain combinations of taken cards. For some purposes, the flowers are used as numerals, with pine having a value of 1, plum having a value of 2, and so forth. This enables the deck to be used for games such as Oicho-Kabu.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "December 15, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Nihon Bussan", "publishers": "Nihon Bussan", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/135508-gionbana\n"}
