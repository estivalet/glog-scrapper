While resembling \"Between the Sheets\", the atmosphere within \"Nothing but Loving You\" is markedly different, particularly more fatalistic, yet again using the space to discuss and showcase different sexualities and how they interact with the lives of Sakurazawa's characters.

Fired from her modeling agency due to her wild and erratic lifestyle, she becomes a freewheeling agent, trying to find work and a new place to live before her former employers kick her out of her subsidized apartment. Within this atmosphere, she sleeps around with upcoming actor Mitsuhiko, who is totally smitten by Nanako, only to find a man much more suitable to her tastes, the stylish bishonen Etsushi.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "February 11, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Coconuts Japan Entertainment", "publishers": "Coconuts Japan Entertainment", "genres": "Life Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.06", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106919-aishiau-koto-shika-dekinai\n"}
