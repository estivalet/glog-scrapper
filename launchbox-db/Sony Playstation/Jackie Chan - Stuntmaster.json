{"altername_name": [], "name": "Jackie Chan: Stuntmaster", "overview": "Jackie Chan's grandfather has been kidnapped and it is up to you to help save him! Midway's action-platform game, Jackie Chan Stuntmaster lets you experience some of what it takes to be the internationally known martial arts actor and stunt performer. You'll play as Jackie Chan himself from a third-person perspective as you cheat death through 15 levels set within a dangerous city full of thugs. Along the way, you'll also need to retrieve a stolen package from a gang of crooks. The crime element is not the only thing you have to deal with -- you'll also cross narrow ledges, avoid obstacles and pitfalls, and even fight on top of a speeding subway train. To accomplish these feats, you must learn how to punch, kick, jump, grab and throw multiple opponents. You also need to climb ladders, open doors, pick up objects (using some as weapons), and hang on ledges or jump off walls. Sound familiar? In addition to the ability to push around objects, you can flip tables and chairs, causing damage to nearby enemies. Other pick-ups let your character heal (rice, milk or take-out-boxes) while others are important for your quest (red and gold dragons and extra takes). Keep in mind that some are hidden beneath boxes, crates and potted-plants that you'll need to break.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "March 28, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Radical Entertainment", "publishers": "Midway Home Entertainment", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.18", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackie_Chan_Stuntmaster", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8plyMi7T_k", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/11287-jackie-chan-stuntmaster\n"}
