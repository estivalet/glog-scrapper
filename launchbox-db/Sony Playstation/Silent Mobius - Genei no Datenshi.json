The intent was to exchange Earth's polluted air and water with clean air and water from Nemesis. To aid in this endeavor, a huge cyclotron was built under Tokyo. Unfortunately for all involved, Ganossa Maximilian - Gigelf's old apprentice - sabotaged the plan, opening the gate early and perverting the gate for his own means. Following this event, Gigelf and the Magician's Guild battled an invasion of Lucifer Hawk (the name for the inhabitants of Nemesis) for a number of years. Gigelf was killed in 2006 and it would seem that the rest of the Guild met similar fates over the next few years. In 2023, Rally Cheyenne, daughter of Guild member Lufa Cheyenne, started the Attacked Mystification Police. Of mixed heritage (her father was from Nemesis), Rally felt partially responsible for the growing attacks on innocent humans by marauding creatures from Nemesis. She started the organization with a mere three officers (Kiddy Phenil, Lebia Maverlick and Nami Yamigumo). Over the next few years, she added Katsumi Liqueur and Yuki Saiko to the team; aiding in the fight to protect Earth from the vicious Lucifer Hawk. Characters: The main character are 5 women.
