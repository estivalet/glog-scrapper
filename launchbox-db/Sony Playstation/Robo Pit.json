{"altername_name": [], "name": "Robo Pit", "overview": "The year is 2042 AD and all forms of physical violence against organic lifeforms have been outlawed. For entertainment the Robo Pit battles have been created. Large corporations can acquire prestige and profit by developing successful robots and weapons. Robots are victorious in battle if they are still functional after defeating their opponent. Upon defeating their opponent they may take their opponents' arms and use them to upgrade themself. The first order of business for the player is to create their own robot. This requires them to select a body, face, base, weapon arms, and a name. Up to ten custom robots may be saved at one time. Arms are rated in five categories: power, speed, defense, type, and skill. Different types of arms are: punch/middle or punch/big punch, hammer/fire or punch/boomerang, sword/axe/kama, lance/squid/spear, small gun/bow gun/laser/cannon, sucker/hand, shield A or B/buckler/talon, and heavy hammer/mace. Battles can be fought against the computer, against another player, or in training mode. For computer battles players can challenge any robot ranked under them or any robot up to 20 ranks above them. The main objective is to eventually reach the number one ranking. Victories against robots ranked higher than them will gain players points and increase their rank. While defeating robots ranked below them won't gain a player a higher rank, it will help to gain experience and receive new weapon arms.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "July 10, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Altron", "publishers": "Kokopeli Digital Studios", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.77", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robo_Pit", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTVZ4XcdfOM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/9222-robo-pit\n"}
