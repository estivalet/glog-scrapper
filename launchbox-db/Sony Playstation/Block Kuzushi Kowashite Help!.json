{"altername_name": [], "name": "Block Kuzushi Kowashite Help!", "overview": "In the game, a layer of bricks lines the top third of the screen. A ball travels across the screen, bouncing off the top and side walls of the screen. When a brick is hit, the ball bounces away and the brick is destroyed. The player loses a turn when the ball touches the bottom of the screen. To prevent this from happening, the player has a movable paddle to bounce the ball upward, keeping it in play. Block Kuzushi Kowashite Help! is a wacky & fun breakout game in which 1 or 2 players can play (in cooperative mode) to advance through the game levels. The game plot is something like this: A princess of a kingdom is transform into a child by an alien and his pets (the players) have to advance through the game and that way she will get back to normal.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "December 7, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Now Production", "publishers": "Media Gallop", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.12", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/91683-block-kuzushi-kowashite-help\n"}
