{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ford Racing", "overview": "As Ford automobiles have won the NASCAR Winston Cup trophy more often than cars from any other manufacturer, it seems natural to create a game based on this consistent success. Empire Interactive has done just that in Ford Racing. In addition to the classic Taurus or Mustang, players may also choose to race a GT90, an Explorer, an F-Series, or one of several concept cars. In all, twelve different vehicles are available to players in Ford Racing. The game features ten racetracks and a couple of different modes of play. Single-player and multiplayer races are available, as well as a career mode. Career mode allows players to race for sponsors, improving their vehicles with a share of the prize money. With continued success and sufficient winnings, players may eventually build up enough of a financial base to sponsor their own racing teams and compete at the world-class level.", "platform": "Sony Playstation", "release_date": "March 6, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Toolbox Design", "publishers": "Empire Interactive", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.23", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Racing_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSBQWLT2PNU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/33980-ford-racing\n"}
