{"altername_name": ["FIFA 06"], "name": "FIFA Soccer 06", "overview": "Featuring a brand new engine (replacing the one used in five titles since FIFA 2003), FIFA 06 features new controls and gameplay, the most visible being more animations and better detailed ball and player physics and animation, the removal of the unpopular Off the Ball controls implemented in their 2004 version and remaking the free-kick interface so it's no longer obvious if the player decided for a shot on goal or a pass to a forward. Also new is the concept of \"Team Chemistry\" which affects how well a team plays collectively.", "platform": "Nintendo GameCube", "release_date": "October 4, 2005", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Electronic Arts Canada", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.69", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_06", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLSKpd0jzCg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6679-fifa-soccer-06\n"}
