{"altername_name": ["Custom Robo: Battle Revolution"], "name": "Custom Robo", "overview": "Get ready to enter a world of hypertech weapons, holosseums, and heavy-barrel battles. Custom Robo puts you in the pilot's seat of a state-of-the-art war machine in the not-too-distant future where crime and justice duke it out in virtual battlegrounds. With the game's powerful, innovative customization, you can construct your robot from the ground up using an arsenal of more than 200 parts and weapons, from guns and bombs to robo models and homing pods. Many weapons are freely available on the market, but some--deadly and highly illegal--can only be acquired in secret robo gambling rooms and from the hands of crime syndicates.", "platform": "Nintendo GameCube", "release_date": "May 10, 2004", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Noise", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.92", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6664-custom-robo\n"}
