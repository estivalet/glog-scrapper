{"altername_name": ["V-Rally 3"], "name": "V-Rally 3", "overview": "V-Rally 3 is a 2002 rally racing video game, developed by Eden Games. It's the third game in the V-Rally series and the sequel of V-Rally 2. The game focuses on the unique career mode, where the player races against bots in various rallies across an endless number of seasons, ultimately trying to become the champion. Alternatively, the game offers a quick race mode, where the player can play time attacks on the stages provided by the game or compete in one of the five different challenges it offers. The game features 24 tracks and 20 official vehicles, including the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VII, the Subaru Impreza WRX '01 and (the game's \"flagship\" car) Peugeot 206 WRC. There are four unlockable vehicles, which can be unlocked once the player has achieved a goal (like claiming the 2,0 L Championship).", "platform": "Nintendo GameCube", "release_date": "June 26, 2003", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "Eden Studios", "publishers": "Atari Europe", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.97", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V-Rally_3", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiW6zH2_gRc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/19940-v-rally-3\n"}
