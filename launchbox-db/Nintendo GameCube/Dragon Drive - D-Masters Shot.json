{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dragon Drive: D-Masters Shot", "overview": "Reiji Ozora is a lazy, good-for-nothing, completely unmotivated junior high school student. His friend Maiko shows him a popular virtual reality game called Dragon Drive, in which players face off against each other using dragons. Reiji's personality nets him a small, lazy dragon which he names Chibisuke, but it turns out there's more to it, and Reiji himself than it would seem at first. Dragon Drive: D-Masters Shot is a third-person action shooter based on the anime Dragon Drive, and the original manga by Kenichi Sakura. The player takes the role of Reiji as he plays the virtual reality game with his dragon Chibisuke, fighting against other players in Virtual On-style arena battles, and through free-roaming and on-rails shooting sections similar to Panzer Dragoon.", "platform": "Nintendo GameCube", "release_date": "March 30, 2003", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Treasure", "publishers": "Bandai", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.73", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Drive:_D-Masters_Shot", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/33626-dragon-drive-d-masters-shot\n"}
