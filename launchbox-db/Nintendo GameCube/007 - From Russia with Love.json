The game is based on the 1957 novel and the 1963 film of the same name, albeit adding in new scenes to make the game more action-oriented, as well as changing the affiliation of the main villains. Additionally, it features many elements of earlier Bond films to recreate the feel of the era such as the jet pack from Thunderball (1965) and the Aston Martin DB5 that debuted in Goldfinger (1964). From Russia with Love is also notable in that it is the first video game to use Sean Connery's likeness as James Bond and the first to include all new voice work by the actor. From Russia with Love is the last James Bond video game EA Games marketed before they lost the rights to Activision in 2006.", "platform": "Nintendo GameCube", "release_date": "November 15, 2005", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Electronic Arts Redwood Shores Studio", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.53", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_Russia_with_Love_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxhrKfYUmQA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6687-007-from-russia-with-love\n"}
