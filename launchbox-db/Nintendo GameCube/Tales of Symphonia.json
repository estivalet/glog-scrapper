{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tales of Symphonia", "overview": "Two worlds exist, unaware of each other. Mana, or life force, is shared by both worlds and while one world thrives, the other suffers. Lloyd Irving lives on Sylvarant, a dying world where nothing is as it seems - a fact he hasn't yet realized. With a strong set of justice, incredible bravery, and a particular loyalty to his friends, he joins them in a very important quest: a journey to save their world. Lloyd's close friend, Colette Brunel, is the Chosen One, destined to save the dying world as a descendant of the Mana bloodline. At the age of 16, the weight of the world hangs on her shoulders. Genis Sage, the village intellectual, is a talented magician with a personality to die - or kill - for. Most likely, you'll grow to love him. Together, they set on this dangerous journey together - to unlock the seals of the world and bring the balance back to their dying town on Sylvarant.", "platform": "Nintendo GameCube", "release_date": "July 13, 2004", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Namco", "publishers": "Namco", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.27", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_of_Symphonia", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGEjk62db3c", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/10381-tales-of-symphonia\n"}
