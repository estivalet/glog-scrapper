{"altername_name": ["Homeland Test Disc"], "name": "Homeland", "overview": "Online servers have been shut down as of April 30, 2007. The game can be played offline in single-player mode, or online in multiplayer mode over the Internet or on a LAN. In online mode, the player can assume the role of gamemaster and create an online game for up to thirty-five other players. An innovative multiplayer online role playing game for GameCube, developed by Chunsoft. The game ships on two discs, one designed as a standalone single-player quest, the other containing a unique online version of the title. Taking a cue from the setup of the classic pen-and-paper RPG Dungeons & Dragons, the online portion of Homeland has one player act as the dungeon master game leader. Instead of directly participating in the adventure, this player controls the game universe, spawns monsters, views player stats, and set up events. Instead of having players connecting to a dedicated game server or online service, the dungeon master's GameCube acts as the server, allowing up to 36 players to connect and participate in the game. Released by mail-order in April, Homeland saw wider retail release in Japan on June 30, 2005.", "platform": "Nintendo GameCube", "release_date": "April 29, 2005", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Chunsoft", "publishers": "Chunsoft", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "36", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeland_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bE-EZ08e-c", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/41227-homeland\n"}
