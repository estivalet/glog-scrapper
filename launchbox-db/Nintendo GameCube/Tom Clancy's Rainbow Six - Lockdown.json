Once again, you play as Domingo 'Ding' Chavez, leading a small commando team on black-ops missions. This time, however, the developer strays from the realistic squad-based action in favor of more arcadish gameplay. The main single player campaign is based around a dangerous virus and hostages. In certain missions, you play as sniper Dieter Weber, picking off terrorists from higher ground and providing cover while the team infiltrates the building.", "platform": "Nintendo GameCube", "release_date": "September 27, 2005", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "M - Mature", "developers": "Red Storm Entertainment", "publishers": "Ubisoft", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.47", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Clancy%27s_Rainbow_Six:_Lockdown", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6741-tom-clancys-rainbow-six-lockdown\n"}
