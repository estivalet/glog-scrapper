Gameplay[edit] In the Career mode, players progress through six geographical regions, each with several sub-levels. The regions are: Forest, Marsh, Desert, Prairie, Mountain, and Tundra. Each sublevel has a specific animal to hunt, though some animals are hunted multiple times on separate occasions, and occasionally the player will encounter other objectives within a level. Money is earned along the way, which can be spent on more-advanced firearms and other equipment. A few opportunities will arise for the player to win a gun by completing certain tasks. Some animals include: white-tail deer, timberwolves and peccary. Other play modes include Quick Hunt, starting with one sublevel per region; other levels become available as they are completed in the Career mode, and Tournaments, including skeet shooting.", "platform": "Nintendo GameCube", "release_date": "December 9, 2004", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Magic Wand Productions", "publishers": "Activision", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.87", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabela%27s_Big_Game_Hunter_2005_Adventures", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6656-cabelas-big-game-hunter-2005-adventures\n"}
