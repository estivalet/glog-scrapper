{"altername_name": [], "name": "Captain Tsubasa: Ougon Sedai no Chousen", "overview": "Another entry in the saga which began on NES. This game is based on the anime / manga Captain Tsubasa, precisely the \"World Youth Team\" Arc. It is a mix between a soccer game and kind of a strategy game (you choose action in a list) with added RPG element (improving player's stats). Like in the base material, soccer isn't really realistic (there is a lot of supermoves).", "platform": "Nintendo GameCube", "release_date": "September 12, 2002", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.89", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/32051-captain-tsubasa-ougon-sedai-no-chousen\n"}
