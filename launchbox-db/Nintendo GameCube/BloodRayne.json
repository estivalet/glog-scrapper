{"altername_name": [], "name": "BloodRayne", "overview": "BloodRayne is a third-person action title starring a secret operative whose mission is to wipe out opposing threats to world security. As female agent BloodRayne, players will be able to tap into her natural talents for hunting down enemies by using her traits as both a human and vampire. Armed with two wrist-mounted silver blades, Rayne can slice and dice would-be assailants as well as throw projectiles or use various firearms. BloodRayne's primary mission will take her to an underground temple in South America, where it is rumored an elite group is trying to unite three parts of an ancient talisman to control the world. As she fights to prevent this, BloodRayne will need to consume the blood of her victims to sustain her life and increase her power. To fight her, the supernatural enemies will plan ambushes or call for reinforcements if the odds are not in their favor. As BloodRayne becomes more proficient at killing, her abilities will increase as well. Talents include speed, agility, vision, and the ability to slow time to attack multiple enemies at once. The amount of blood she drinks also makes her stronger, beginning with Bloodlust and culminating in Bloodrage. Cinematic cut-scenes highlight certain actions for dramatic effect as well as further the story as the operative gets closer to her goal.", "platform": "Nintendo GameCube", "release_date": "October 15, 2002", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "M - Mature", "developers": "Terminal Reality", "publishers": "Majesco Entertainment", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.54", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BloodRayne_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/12472-bloodrayne\n"}
