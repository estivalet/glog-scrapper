This version introduces some new tricks, updates some features, and brings depth to some game modes from previous Madden titles. The 07 game focuses on the Running Back by giving you lead blocker controls. After selecting a running play, you can cycle through offensive players to open up gaps. New evasive maneuvers are controlled with a separate stick to elude defenders, along with new juking and spinning maneuvers. Start a career with your favorite NFL team, draft the players, call the plays, and lead your team to a dynasty. Or, make your own player and guide him on and off the field through his entire career starting with the draft. If you do not want to mess with all the options and features you can simply sit down for a quick game.", "platform": "Nintendo GameCube", "release_date": "August 22, 2006", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "EA Tiburon", "publishers": "EA Sports", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.56", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madden_NFL_07", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/15314-madden-nfl-07\n"}
