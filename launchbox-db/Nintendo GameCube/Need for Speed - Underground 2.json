{"altername_name": [], "name": "Need for Speed: Underground 2", "overview": "Need For Speed Underground 2 takes place in Bayview after the events of Need for Speed: Underground. The prologue begins with the player driving in a Nissan Skyline R34 in Olympic City (though the racing scenes are actually in Bayview), the setting of NFS:UG. He then receives a race challenge from a rather ominous personality who offers him a spot on his crew, but \"won't take 'no' for an answer.\" The player races off \u2014 despite Samantha's warnings \u2014 only to be ambushed by a mysterious driver in a rage that totals his Skyline. The driver, who has a unique scythe tattoo, makes a call confirming the accident, and the flashback fades out.", "platform": "Nintendo GameCube", "release_date": "November 15, 2004", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Electronic Arts", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.27", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Need_for_Speed:_Underground_2", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYVIrJBJOhE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/8983-need-for-speed-underground-2\n"}
