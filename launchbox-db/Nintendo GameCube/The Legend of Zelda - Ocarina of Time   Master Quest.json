Only true heroes will make it through this quest alive!). Fans of Nintendo's acclaimed series can play both of these games on their GameCubes, and enjoy a few technical improvements over the N64 versions, namely a higher 640x480 resolution, Dolby Pro-Logic surround sound support, and 480p Progressive Scan support.
