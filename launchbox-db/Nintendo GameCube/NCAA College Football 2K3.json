{"altername_name": [], "name": "NCAA College Football 2K3", "overview": "NCAA College Football 2K3 is an American football video game released in 2002 by Visual Concepts. The cover athlete is former Nebraska Cornhuskers quarterback Eric Crouch. It is the second College Football game by Visual Concepts (the first being NCAA College Football 2K2: Road to the Rose Bowl for the Dreamcast ). The game also has ESPN style game play, meaning at half-time it gives you a report on your game and others around the league. It includes an editable roster, but you cannot name the players as, traditionally, NCAA athletes are referred to as \"John Doe\" and not by their full name. There are basic game modes such as the dynasty or jump into a quick play. Dynasty is where you lead your team over the course of a year to the National Championship. Legacy mode is when you completely take over a team, control its recruiting classes, and remain a \"Division 1\" powerhouse. The game was also the last college football video game made by Visual Concepts.", "platform": "Nintendo GameCube", "release_date": "September 9, 2002", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Avalanche Software", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_College_Football_2K3", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/14027-ncaa-college-football-2k3\n"}
