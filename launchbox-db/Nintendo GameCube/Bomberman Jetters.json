{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bomberman Jetters", "overview": "Mujoe and The Hige Hige Bandits, sick and tired of Bomberman repeatedly stopping their plans at galactic conquest, enact a plan to do away with him and his kind forever; Dark Star, Mujoe's artificial comet, would be used and hurled straight into Bomberman's home world, Planet Bomber. The resulting collision would completely obliterate the planet and all who were still on it. Dark Star will hit the planet in under 24 hours, so Bomberman and Max are sent out to deactivate the huge engines propelling the comet through space, thereby disabling its flight-plan and again thwarting the Hige Hige Bandits.", "platform": "Nintendo GameCube", "release_date": "March 10, 2004", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Hudson Soft", "publishers": "Majesco Entertainment", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.95", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomberman_Jetters_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6653-bomberman-jetters\n"}
