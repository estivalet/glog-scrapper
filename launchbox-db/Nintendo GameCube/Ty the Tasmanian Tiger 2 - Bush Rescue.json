{"altername_name": ["TY der Tasmanische Tiger 2: Die Bumerang-Gang"], "name": "Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 2: Bush Rescue", "overview": "Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 2 is a 3D Platformer with an Australian theme. The player takes the role of TY, a Tasmanian tiger, armed with sharp teeth and boomerangs a-plenty. On TY's quest to defeat the evil Boss Cass and his army of cold-blooded Frilled Lizards, he must assist the colorful residents of Burramudgee Town and the Southern Rivers, who include a tree frog, a lyre bird, a platypus family, some kangaroos and more koalas than you can shake a didgeridoo at. While most of the game is standard platform fare, there are some diversions. Notably, there are a number of cart racing tracks which can be played with a friend. Additionally, there are missions that will place the player in giant robots, each with a different speciality (one is good at battle, one can put out fires, one is a submarine, etc.). There are many comedic quirks, having the players throw electrified boomerangs at robotic dinosaurs in the Outback, then send them up in a helicopter to rescue sheep stranded by a flood, then have them clear a road following a traffic accident. And finally, to top it all off, the save/continue points are outhouses.", "platform": "Nintendo GameCube", "release_date": "October 12, 2004", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Krome Studios", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.11", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ty_the_Tasmanian_Tiger_2:_Bush_Rescue", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/30885-ty-the-tasmanian-tiger-2-bush-rescue\n"}
