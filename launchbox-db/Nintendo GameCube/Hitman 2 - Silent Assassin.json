{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hitman 2: Silent Assassin", "overview": "Hitman 2 features mission-based gameplay. On each level, the main character, known only as 47, is given a set of objectives to complete. Most levels require the assassination of one or more people. However, how missions are completed is up to the player, and there are almost always a variety of ways to complete missions. Instead of simply running and gunning through the mission, one can set sneaky traps, like poisoning a drink, to terminate the target in silence. Once again, it's up to the player to decide how he or she will kill the target.", "platform": "Nintendo GameCube", "release_date": "June 19, 2003", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "M - Mature", "developers": "IO Interactive", "publishers": "Eidos Interactive", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.77", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitman_2:_Silent_Assassin", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9d5UolRzwV8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/5175-hitman-2-silent-assassin\n"}
