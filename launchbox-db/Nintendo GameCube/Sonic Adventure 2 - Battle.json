Dr. Eggman is up to his old tricks, and it's up to Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles to stop him yet again. Sonic Adventure 2: Battle features faster action, all-new two-player games, and a branching storyline that lets you choose to save the world as the Hero side, or conquer it as the Dark side. Two new playable characters enter the Sonic universe -- a mysterious dark hedgehog called Shadow, and a jewel-thieving bat named Rouge. In the single-player mode, you'll go through more than 30 unique stages, which include everything from a forgotten pyramid, an abandoned military base, and a giant space station. Then there's the expanded two-player mode, which features 12 playable characters competing in new head-to-head games. All of this adds up to Sonic's biggest adventure yet!", "platform": "Nintendo GameCube", "release_date": "December 20, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Sonic Team", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.30", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_Adventure_2#GameCube_port", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDqBJZVa1Z4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/3994-sonic-adventure-2-battle\n"}
