Upon arrival, however, they discover the island has been polluted causing its energy source, the Shine Sprites, to disappear. The culprit is similar in appearance to Mario, who is blamed for the mess, so the portly plumber is forced to clean up the island. Mario is given an invention called FLUDD (a backpack with several water nozzles) to help him clean up graffiti and mud and capture the real villain. Gameplay features a combination of action and puzzle solving, with numerous stages and multiple episodes to each stage, and plenty of hidden secrets and surprises.", "platform": "Nintendo GameCube", "release_date": "August 26, 2002", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Nintendo EAD", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.38", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Sunshine", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arvnhNPUrl0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2125-super-mario-sunshine\n"}
