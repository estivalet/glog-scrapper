{"altername_name": ["Nintendo GameCube Service Disc Version 1.0-03"], "name": "Service Disc", "overview": "GameCube Service Disc v1.0/03 was once used by Nintendo World Class Service to test and diagnose problems with the console, Memory Cards, controllers, and can even check the currently-inserted Game Boy Advance game through the GameCube-Game Boy Advance Cable. Nintendo 64 controllers can also be detected, suggesting this is from earlier in the console's development. As with all Nintendo testing software, the Service Disc contains a plethora of Nintendo-themed content, both used and unused. Bizarrely, there are also respectable logos from the automotive industry, such as Tamiya and Goodyear. Console revisions post-2003 will boot the Service Disc to an indefinitely-hung black screen, likely done to prevent further servicing after the demise of the Nintendo World Class Service. Remaining copies were taken back by Nintendo and presumably destroyed; as such, few copies saw the light of day.", "platform": "Nintendo GameCube", "release_date": "", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nintendo", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/166136-service-disc\n"}
