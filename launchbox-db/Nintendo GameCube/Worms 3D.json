{"altername_name": [], "name": "Worms 3D", "overview": "The gameplay itself hasn't changed much from its predecessors, with the exception of the three-dimensional view, which allows the player more freedom, and more possibilities, to complete the task at hand. Modes like Campaign and Quick Match return from previous versions. The game also features a multiplayer feature, as well as the ability to edit and create teams. The objective of most of the matches is to eliminate the opposing forces' worms, whereas the Campaign mode gives the player sets of specific goals which he needs to complete. The campaign consists of 35 small missions in which the player has to utilise their worms to complete a certain task, like destroy enemy worms, collect a certain crate, or even unique missions, like having to detonate 16 hidden landmines in a certain time. All of the missions give awards depending on how well you do. Gold medals usually unlock bonuses as for example maps, challenge missions, infos about weapons or voice banks. In the challenge missions in you have to use a weapon/utility to collect targets that add to your timebank which increases steadily. Getting a gold medal here unlocks maps or locked weapons.", "platform": "Nintendo GameCube", "release_date": "March 11, 2004", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Team 17", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.12", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worms_3D", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AYSxgNKG68", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4505-worms-3d\n"}
