{"altername_name": [], "name": "Legends of Wrestling", "overview": "Legends of Wrestling is a professional wrestling video game based on the greatest wrestlers of all time, from WWF/WWE, NWA, WCW, WCCW, AWA, ECW and various independent promotions. It was developed and produced by Acclaim. Legends Of Wrestling features wrestlers from various different eras of professional wrestling, from old school guys such as Killer Kowalski and Bruno Sammartino to Rock'n'Wrestling era stars such as Hulk Hogan and Ted DiBiase to even modern wrestlers such as Rob Van Dam and Eddie Guerrero, although it'd be lying to say that Hogan himself wasn't the top attraction of the games, featuring prominently on every installment's cover. The second game also featured the late comedian Andy Kaufman, with the career mode being able to relive his feud with Jerry Lawler. In total, three installments were released before Acclaim folded: Legends Of Wrestling in 2001, Legends Of Wrestling II in 2002 and Showdown: Legends Of Wrestling in 2004.", "platform": "Nintendo GameCube", "release_date": "May 27, 2002", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Acclaim Studios Salt Lake City", "publishers": "Acclaim Entertainment", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.63", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legends_of_Wrestling", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGDLaiP2eW0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/30817-legends-of-wrestling\n"}
