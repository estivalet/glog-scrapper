Featuring eight different missions, which require a deadly mixture of cunning stealth and brute force to survive, each mission has checkpoints where the player can save the game during the mission without having to replay the entire mission. Players will need to outfit themselves with the tools of the trade from body armor and over 14 weapons, to silencers to make the \"hit\".", "platform": "Nintendo GameCube", "release_date": "September 28, 2004", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Point of View", "publishers": "Crave Entertainment", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigger_Man_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/18135-trigger-man\n"}
