{"altername_name": [], "name": "Midway Arcade Treasures", "overview": "Midway Arcade Treasures is a video game compilation of 24 arcade games developed by Digital Eclipse and released by Midway for the GameCube, PlayStation 2, Xbox and Microsoft Windows. The Xbox version is not compatible with Xbox 360. Midway followed up the Arcade Treasures with successive compilations featuring different games: Midway Arcade Treasures 2, Midway Arcade Treasures 3, the portable Midway Arcade Treasures: Extended Play and the Windows-exclusive Midway Arcade Treasures Deluxe Edition. After Midway's bankruptcy, Warner Bros. owns the rights and released another arcade compilation called Midway Arcade Origins for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 which includes 29 select games from MAT 1 and 2 plus Super Off Road from 3. It also contains Vindicators Part II which replaced the original Vindicators from Midway Arcade Treasures. This game was later rereleased as Midway Arcade Treasures 1, the title and packaging being changed slightly to match the second and third games in the series. Despite this, the games themselves remain the same. A similar collection of Midway arcade games was also released exclusively in Japan by Success under the title Game Center USA: Midway Arcade Treasures, which compiled 32 select games from MAT 1 and 2 and was released for the PlayStation 2 on September 21, 2006.", "platform": "Nintendo GameCube", "release_date": "November 18, 2003", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Digital Eclipse", "publishers": "Midway", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.03", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midway_Arcade_Treasures", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/13649-midway-arcade-treasures\n"}
