It was originally released in Japan on December 1, 1999 as a launch title for the 64DD, for which a soundtrack by Tatsuhiko Asano was released on CD by Media Factory, early the next year. Both of these received positive reviews. An expansion was released five months later called Kyojin no Doshin Kaiho Sensen Chibikko Chikko Daishugou, which takes a very different perspective of the game, featuring short animated clips that the player can unlock after playing the original game. Doshin the Giant was later released and upgraded graphically for the GameCube and released in Japan on March 14, 2002 and Europe on September 20, 2002. The re-release received mostly positive reviews.", "platform": "Nintendo GameCube", "release_date": "December 20, 2002", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nintendo", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.60", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doshin_the_Giant", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_3ajqjpyJg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/23569-doshin-the-giant\n"}
