In 2008 and 2009, the game was re-released in the New Play Control! series of revamped Nintendo GameCube titles. The Wii version of Donkey Kong Jungle Beat is somewhat changed from the original GameCube version, including new levels, modifications of old levels, and traditional controls that have the player use the analog stick to move and the A button to jump, unlike the GameCube version which required the player to beat the bongos to do both.
