{"altername_name": [], "name": "NHL 2004", "overview": "NHL 2004, developed by the EA Black Box studios, is an ice hockey video game. It is the successor to NHL 2003 and is widely considered to be a major turning point in the NHL series. The game adds 3 European Elite Leagues: Germany's Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL), Sweden's Elitserien (SEL), and Finland's SM-liiga. (This is not the first time that European teams are included in an EA game; EA released both Elitserien 95 and Elitserien 96 for the Mega Drive in Sweden only and Elitserien and SM-liiga 2001 as an expansion pack for PC in Sweden and Finland which included those teams.) The ratings of the teams in the Elitserien and SM-liiga were comparable to the NHL rosters, however future installments had the league teams inferior to the NHL.", "platform": "Nintendo GameCube", "release_date": "September 22, 2003", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Electronic Arts Black Box", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.71", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHL_2004", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/30846-nhl-2004\n"}
