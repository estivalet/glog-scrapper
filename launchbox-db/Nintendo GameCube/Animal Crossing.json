With Animal Crossing's 24-hour clock, the game's unique events can be in synch with real time--as day turns to night in the real world, the sun will also begin to set in the game. The dynamic setup requires you to come back every day and carry out your daily routines, build relationships with villagers, celebrate special days, collect furnishings for your homes, and just live life in the unique world of Animal Crossing.", "platform": "Nintendo GameCube", "release_date": "December 14, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Nintendo EAD", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Life Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.30", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Crossing_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNxjGDGBYlg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/5498-animal-crossing\n"}
