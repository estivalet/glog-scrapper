{"altername_name": [], "name": "RoadKill", "overview": "RoadKill lets players fight it out on the go in a post-apocalyptic world destroyed by a plague and ruled by gangs. Players get behind the controls of 30 vehicles with weapons such as machine-guns, guided missiles and grenade launchers destroying enemy gangs and building a gang of their own to take control of roads of this abysmal world. The game offers 30 core missions with plenty of side missions, 30 vehicles armed with a variety of weapons, combat against vehicles, armed pedestrians and stationary targets, and a reputation system that slowly raises your status and enables you to create a gang of thugs. Players can also unlock secret items that can be used to soup up vehicles, and 2-4 player split-screen multiplayer modes for when you're finished with the single player", "platform": "Nintendo GameCube", "release_date": "November 4, 2003", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "M - Mature", "developers": "Midway", "publishers": "Midway", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.88", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RoadKill_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/10260-roadkill\n"}
