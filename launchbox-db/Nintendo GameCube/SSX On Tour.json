{"altername_name": ["SSX On Tour with Mario"], "name": "SSX On Tour", "overview": "Gamers return to the slopes in this third full edition of EA's exaggerated-action snowboarding series, SSX. As the game goes \"On Tour,\" players create their own custom characters, which they'll develop from amateur bunny-hillers to seasoned \"Black Diamond\" pros. For the first time, the game allows skiers on the mountains as well, and players can decide if they'd rather ski or board when they create their characters. Building upon a distinguishing feature of the series, SSX On Tour features long, seamlessly streaming courses, some of which may take as long as half-an-hour (of real-time) to complete. The slopes are populated with fellow boarders and skiers in this edition, providing some extra personality. Featuring more than 40 songs, the diverse rock soundtrack includes selections by Def Leppard, The Hives, Iron Maiden, Bloc Party, Jurassic 5, and several others.", "platform": "Nintendo GameCube", "release_date": "October 11, 2005", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "Electronic Arts", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.20", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSX_on_Tour", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-KYNshcRew", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/10382-ssx-on-tour\n"}
