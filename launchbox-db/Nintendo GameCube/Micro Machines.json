Players spend most of their time in the game's aptly titled \"race\" mode, piloting their diminutive vehicle around tracks built into huge streets, a bizarre sci-fi themed toy room, a barn, and so on, for a total of eight environments, with two tracks apiece. There are eight characters in all. Will you be the angry looking policeman, or the lady in a spacesuit who sounds like a man? The choice is yours. Each character comes with a matching vehicle. The redneck has a truck, the Crocodile Hunter ripoff has a jeep, and so on. There are vehicle specific abilities for each ride that can be turned off and on", "platform": "Nintendo GameCube", "release_date": "March 12, 2003", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Infogrames Sheffield House", "publishers": "Infogrames", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.81", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/18133-micro-machines\n"}
