On your journey you will be accompanied by healers like Linear Cannon, your gun toting butler, and others. Your weapons are what is known as \"Cyframes\" with upgrades being purchased to add more options such as slash and cannon attacks. The only character that uses actual magic is Linear Cannon, and all other characters use \"FP\" to perform their various special attacks such as Mag's \"Crushing Hammer Blow\".
