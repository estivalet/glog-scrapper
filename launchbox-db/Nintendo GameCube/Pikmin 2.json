{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pikmin 2", "overview": "Captain Olimar has returned to the planet where the Pikmin live, and he's all business this time. The company he works for is going bankrupt, so to save it, Olimar must salvage the treasure buried all over the planet. Of course, he'll need the help of the Pikmin to do that--he can't do anything by himself. Control one of two main characters--Olimar or his assistant--as you command your Pikmin to defeat enemies, propagate more Pikmin, collect precious doodads, and solve puzzles. With unlimited time, new colors of Pikmin, and two-player cooperative play, Pikmin 2 improves on the original in many ways.", "platform": "Nintendo GameCube", "release_date": "August 30, 2004", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Nintendo", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.30", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pikmin_2", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cteEOv7pmHI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6486-pikmin-2\n"}
