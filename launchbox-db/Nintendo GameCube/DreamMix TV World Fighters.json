An unorthodox plan is implemented: broadcast a contest pitting various superstars from different realities in physical combat in order to increase ratings. Up to four gamers can choose from seventeen playable characters, each with their own themed backdrop, from video game and toy series such as Castlevania, Metal Gear, Gradius, Bomberman, Adventure Island, Bloody Roar, Transformers, Beyblade, and Micronauts.", "platform": "Nintendo GameCube", "release_date": "December 18, 2003", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "BitStep", "publishers": "Hudson", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.45", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DreamMix_TV_World_Fighters", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJE6IZRNZs4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/28071-dreammix-tv-world-fighters\n"}
