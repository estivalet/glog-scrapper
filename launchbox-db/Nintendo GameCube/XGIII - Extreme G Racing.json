{"altername_name": ["Extreme-G 3"], "name": "XGIII: Extreme G Racing", "overview": "XGIII: Extreme G Racing is a futuristic racing game. Six teams are competing to win a racing championship, the player taking control of any of the two riders available in each team. The game retains the action elements of the previous titles: as before, opponents will try to sabotage the race, and the player-controlled character is able to answer them with his own arsenal of weapons. Unlike the previous installments, weapons cannot be picked up on the road: the player has to purchase them with the money earned after a successful race. All weapons now deplete the player's weapon bar with each shot. Another change is the absence of the \"nitro\" boosts utilized in the previous entries; they have been replaced with a turbo system, where using the boost drains energy from the player character's shields.", "platform": "Nintendo GameCube", "release_date": "November 27, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Acclaim Studios Cheltenham", "publishers": "Acclaim Entertainment", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.52", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme-G_3", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6677-xgiii-extreme-g-racing\n"}
