{"altername_name": [], "name": "Freekstyle", "overview": "Freekstyle is a EA Sports' take on motocross racing. This game is all about going fast and doing cool tricks. There are essentially two games here: first there is a straightforward racing game, where you race three laps around a circuit and attempt to finish first. The second part of the game is a freestyle competition, where you perform tricks to score points, and attempt to rack up the biggest total. The racing game, or \"Freekstyle\" mode, combines racing and tricks. You will race around a circuit track, and attempt to perform tricks at the big jumps you encounter along the way. Performing tricks fills your boost meter, which then gives you a speed boost you can use at your discretion. If you perform enough tricks, eventually you can break into \"freakout\" mode, where you can travel at ludicrous speed. Freekstyle features the voices and likeness of several real-life motocross stars.", "platform": "Nintendo GameCube", "release_date": "September 5, 2002", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Hypnos Entertainment", "publishers": "EA Sports BIG", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.19", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freekstyle", "video_link": "https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=8y-Xz-6YYv4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/9322-freekstyle\n"}
