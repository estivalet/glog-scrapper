{"altername_name": [], "name": "Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance", "overview": "Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance casts the player as one of three basic characters: an elf sorceress, a human archer, or a dwarf fighter. From humble beginnings slaying rats in the cellars of an inn, the adventurer will move on to exploring caves, crypts, and mountain passes. Naturally, it's all filled to the brim with horrible monsters, wicked traps, treasures, and fabled magical weapons. As the game progresses the player is constantly rewarded with new weaponry, new monsters to fight, and experience points to put into the adventurer's character stats to grow even more powerful. The adventurer must eventually unravel the secrets of a dark, new Thieves Guild backed by powerful mages.", "platform": "Nintendo GameCube", "release_date": "November 20, 2002", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Snowblind Studios", "publishers": "Interplay", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.20", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldur%27s_Gate:_Dark_Alliance", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JLmmFqr6aU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/5557-baldurs-gate-dark-alliance\n"}
