{"altername_name": [], "name": "Big Mutha Truckers", "overview": "Big Mutha Truckers also known as Bakus\u014d Convoy Densetsu in Japan is a 2002 racing video game developed by British studio Eutechnyx. Set in fictional Hick County, the game revolves around completing trips between cities, delivering goods, and competing in races while at the helm of an eighteen wheeler. The game is available on Nintendo GameCube, Nintendo DS, Xbox, PlayStation 2, Game Boy Advance and PC, but enjoyed only mediocre critical and commercial success due to repetitive gameplay, dated graphics, and lackluster sound. The game uses Steppenwolf's \"Born to Be Wild\" as its theme song. The sequel is Big Mutha Truckers 2. The game's plot revolves around one of four available characters and their quest to inherit the family business. With plans to retire from the family business, Ma' Jackson challenges her four children, Cletus, Earl, Rawkus, and Bobbie-Sue, to a \"Trial by Truckin\". She gives each sibling 60 days in which to make deliveries to various cities in Hick State County, with the company going to the sibling with the most money in the end.", "platform": "Nintendo GameCube", "release_date": "August 16, 2003", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Eutechnyx", "publishers": "THQ", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.80", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Mutha_Truckers", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/30738-big-mutha-truckers\n"}
