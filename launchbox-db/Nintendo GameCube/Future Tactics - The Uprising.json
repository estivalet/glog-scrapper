{"altername_name": [], "name": "Future Tactics: The Uprising", "overview": "Future Tactics: The Uprising is a turn based tactical shooter video game by Zed Two. Once known as Pillage, this colourful turn based shooter was stuck in development for a number of years before being picked up by Crave for a US release, followed shortly by JoWood for a European release. It plays a lot like the Worms 3D games and has a story penned by Paul Rose, who used to write the video game page Digitiser on Channel 4's Teletext. The game features a geo-mod system in which almost anything can be destroyed, leaving battlefields scarred by craters. It was released on PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube and Windows. A Gizmondo version was planned but canceled after Tiger Telematics went bankrupt.", "platform": "Nintendo GameCube", "release_date": "May 10, 2004", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Zed Two", "publishers": "Crave Entertainment", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.84", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Tactics:_The_Uprising", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/30802-future-tactics-the-uprising\n"}
