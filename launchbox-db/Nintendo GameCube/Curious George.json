When the Man with the Yellow Hat travels to Africa in search of a lost artifact, he returns with some unexpected cargo -- a curious little primate named George. Guide George as he runs, jumps, climbs and swings his way through 12 adventure-packed levels from the jungle to the Big City, where his spunky and fun-loving nature endears him to new friends and lands him in a series of mis-adventures. Make monkey business as you help George and his friends discover the one item special enough to save the museum from the bulldozer. Loads of bonus content and challenging mini-games keep players busy long after the main story is done.", "platform": "Nintendo GameCube", "release_date": "February 1, 2006", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Monkey Bar Games", "publishers": "Namco", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.76", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curious_George_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/10258-curious-george\n"}
