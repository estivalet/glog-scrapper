{"altername_name": [], "name": "Def Jam: Fight for NY", "overview": "Def Jam: Fight for NY is the sequel to the out-of-left-field Def Jam: Vendetta. The game opens with the person you beat in the previous game, D-Mobb, being arrested. As the police are driving, an SUV comes out of nowhere and smashes into the car, setting D-Mobb free. After a quick cutscene, it turns out the person who was driving the SUV was you, and you have now joined D-Mobb's crew. Fight for NY's story mode takes you through the ranks, and pits you against tougher and tougher fighters. You start off in D-Mobb's crew as a nobody, and will have to work your way up, fighting off people from other crews, including D-Mobb's rival, Crow. You'll take part mostly in one-on-one brawls, with the odd team match and free for all thrown in. To aid you in fighting, you can use the environment to hurt your enemy. You can smash people into wooden/cement walls, fences, or just whack them off of a wooden pillar. Speakers, soda machines, garbage cans... All there to harm your enemy (or you). Some objects are interactive, such as flood lights, which will change the lighting of the ring once someone's been thrown into them. You have weapons at your disposal, usually a metal pipe, pool cue and broken bottle.", "platform": "Nintendo GameCube", "release_date": "September 20, 2004", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "M - Mature", "developers": "AKI", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.16", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Def_Jam:_Fight_for_NY", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzjk-JJc4oU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/9498-def-jam-fight-for-ny\n"}
