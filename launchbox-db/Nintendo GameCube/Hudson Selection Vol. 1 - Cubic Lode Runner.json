{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hudson Selection Vol. 1: Cubic Lode Runner", "overview": "Cubic Lode Runner is the first release in Hudson's new range of budget-priced updates of classic games. The game is based on the classic NES version of Lode Runner, but this update is in full 3D with new stages and features. The gameplay has been updated to take advantage of the extra dimension, and the player can now move in 3D and can dig in all four directions. The game is, therefore, more than just the NES port that many previews suggested.", "platform": "Nintendo GameCube", "release_date": "July 10, 2003", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hudson Soft", "publishers": "Hudson Soft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_Selection", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/45241-hudson-selection-vol-1-cubic-lode-runner\n"}
