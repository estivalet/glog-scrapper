{"altername_name": ["Disney's Mickey Mouse no Fushigi na Kagami"], "name": "Disney's Magical Mirror Starring Mickey Mouse", "overview": "One night, a mischievous ghost traps a sleepwalking Mickey Mouse in a magical mirror. Returning to his bed won't be easy, though, because Mickey must first recover the broken mirror pieces that have been strewn about the house by the prankish poltergeist. Just as in a Mickey cartoon, you will have to outwit enemies and pull gags. You will also be able to uncover special souvenirs, such as Pluto's collar or Minnie's bow, which are all displayed in Mickey's room at the end of the game.", "platform": "Nintendo GameCube", "release_date": "August 11, 2002", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Capcom", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.74", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney%27s_Magical_Mirror_Starring_Mickey_Mouse", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKi3ABAyG7s", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/20294-disneys-magical-mirror-starring-mickey-mouse\n"}
