The movie is based on J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, the fourth novel in the Harry Potter series. The game follows the three main characters of the film \u2014 namely Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasley \u2014 and there is an entirely new spell-casting system that allows for collaborative spells. The characters themselves more closely resemble their film counterparts than in previous games. It also has higher-quality graphics than the previous Harry Potter video games. However, the game play in the fourth video game is much more action-oriented, which is a change from the previous games. In addition, players can play the game with friends, and can combine their magic and spells to make them more powerful. Players can also capture moving beans using Accio and increase their power with collectors, creature, and character, cards. There is no RPG iteration of the game, unlike with previous titles. In addition, it was pointed out that unlike the previous installments, there was not much room to \"run around\" such as in the previous games where you were allowed to move freely within the castle and on the grounds. The game is divided into several non-consecutive levels, some of which are locked at the beginning of the game until the player collects enough Triwizard Shields to unlock it. It is noted as the last Harry Potter game released on GameCube and Xbox, it is also the first Harry Potter Game to get an E10+ Rating in North America.", "platform": "Nintendo GameCube", "release_date": "November 8, 2005", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "Electronic Arts UK", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "3", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.27", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Goblet_of_Fire_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/13006-harry-potter-and-the-goblet-of-fire\n"}
