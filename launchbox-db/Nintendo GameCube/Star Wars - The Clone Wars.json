{"altername_name": ["Star Wars: Las Guerras Clon", "Star Wars: La Guerra dei Cloni"], "name": "Star Wars: The Clone Wars", "overview": "The Clone Wars has you deep inside the battles of the Old Republic through 16 missions, piloting a range of vehicles including speeder bikes, Republic Gunships and fighter tanks as well as the weapon of the Jedi, your lightsabre, for close combat. Whereas the Rogue Squadron series concentrated on aerial battles, The Clone Wars contains almost all ground battles. You must fight as Anakin Skywalker, Obi Wan Kenobi, Mace Windu, and others throughout the game to prevent the Confederacy from gaining a deadly weapon. Multiplayer options are also included for up to four players with game types including deathmatch, conquest, and a co-op ground and vehicle survival mode.", "platform": "Nintendo GameCube", "release_date": "October 28, 2002", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Pandemic", "publishers": "LucasArts", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.98", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Clone_Wars_(2002_video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJFm9c4F_8Y", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6762-star-wars-the-clone-wars\n"}
