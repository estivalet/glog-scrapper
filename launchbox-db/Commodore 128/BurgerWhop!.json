{"altername_name": [], "name": "BurgerWhop!", "overview": "BurgerWhop! was one of the few games ever written for the Commodore-128 in 80-column mode. The game play closely mimics the look and feel of the Intellivision version of Burger Time copyright 1982 by Data East, where the player controls a chef who attempts to build giant hamburgers by navigating around a maze of planks and ladders. The chef is being chased by other members of the food world that are trying to stop him. The chef can temporarily freeze those nasties by throwing pepper at them to make them sneeze, or he can squish them under a falling burger part. Bonus items appear at times to pick up for extra points, and giving one or more nasties a ride on top of a falling burger part quickly increases the score. BurgerWhop! uses color character-based graphics and custom character bitmaps with three tracks for music and sound effects.", "platform": "Commodore 128", "release_date": "August 23, 1988", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Brian L.
