{"altername_name": ["The Rocky Horror Picture Show"], "name": "The Rocky Horror Show", "overview": "The Rocky Horror Show is a video game, based on the musical of the same name, where you get to control either Brad or Janet in your quest to explore the strange interior over at the Frankenstein place. It's a bit of a mind flip but if you are careful you'll do the time warp, again! Play as either Brad or Janet to rescue the other, in this computer adaptation of the hit Broadway Musical The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Search the castle for pieces of the Medusa machine to free your partner from stone and escape the castle before it blasts off. Each one must be taken to the De-Medusa machine, only carrying one at a time. You must collect keys and disable force fields along the way. Other characters in the game will hinder your progress by stealing and hiding your clothes or other objects you may be carrying. Watch out for Riff-Raff or he'll shoot you with his laser gun. And if Eddie thaws out and escapes from the freezer, he'll run you over with his motorcycle.", "platform": "Commodore 128", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "CRL Group", "publishers": "Alternative Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.33", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rocky_Horror_Show_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvoxRGxMRZU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/107687-the-rocky-horror-show\n"}
