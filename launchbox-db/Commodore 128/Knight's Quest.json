{"altername_name": [], "name": "Knight's Quest", "overview": "An 80 Column screen mode C128 game published in Issue #12 of Loadstar 128 in 1991. The game is modeled on a typical RPG turn based game, but with a couple of twists. First of all, it can be played as a two-player game. Each player has their own character to play in the adventure. In Jon's game instructions, he kind of likens this idea to a two player board game; kind of like King Arthur meets Monopoly. There's also a real-time jousting \u201cmini game\u201d that you take part at certain times during your adventure.", "platform": "Commodore 128", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jon Mattson", "publishers": "J & F Publishing, Inc.", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.my64.in.nf/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=reviews:videos:knights-quest.mp4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/159777-knights-quest\n"}
