{"altername_name": ["Adventure A 128: Planet of Demise"], "name": "Planet of Demise", "overview": "A remade Adventure A, based on the original Planet of Death with the following goals in mind: This is a CP/M only game. Correct some of the criticisms of the writing. Not all in CAPITALS. Target obscure retro platforms. Learn a little about how adventure games could be put together. Experiment with ChatCPT. The original game was criticized for poor usage of apostrophes and all CAPS. The capital letter problem is likely due to the original platforms it was released on. Anyway, because I don't want to copy the original game completely I have re-authored all text in the game. The fact it is a remake more than an exact copy is why it's not called Planet of Death. ChatCPT was called in to help author these improved descriptions. Therein lies an underlying technology goal of this project, I do have Ai related plans and I need a simple adventure game to experiment with (you can complete the original in 50 turns according to the three minute video on youtube).. That's for the future though.", "platform": "Commodore 128", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "The Retro Programmer", "publishers": "", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/369813-planet-of-demise\n"}
