{"altername_name": ["Innuh's Pyramid", "Blackjack 80"], "name": "The Innuh's Pyramid", "overview": "Originally written in Italian as La Piramide di Iunnuh by Aristide Torrelli for the TI99/4a. In 2018, Davide Bucci rewrote it in C with an improved parser. Compiled versions are available for the Commodore PET, VIC-20, C64, C128 and Plus 4 and the Spectrum. All except the VIC-20 have longer room descriptions. He also translated it to English. The Innuh's pyramid was built three thousand years ago, somewhere in the desert. Ancient tales say it is full of treasures, but nobody who dared to try to reveal its secrets could come back to tell his adventure. I'll be your eyes and ears. Your goal is to find all the treasures hidden in the pyramid. Good luck, you'll need it!", "platform": "Commodore 128", "release_date": "September 20, 2018", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Aristide Torrelli", "publishers": "", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/160171-the-innuhs-pyramid\n"}
