{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dice Poker", "overview": "Dice Poker is a 1 to 4 player game that combines the strategy of draw poker with the luck of a dice throw. In a 1 player game, you do not play against the computer as the object is to better your score by strategy rather than luck. A lucky throw does not always insure a victory as strategy must be employed as well. The same logic holds true for the 2 to 4 player games.", "platform": "Commodore 128", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Louis Avanzi", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Casino", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.9", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/127195-dice-poker\n"}
