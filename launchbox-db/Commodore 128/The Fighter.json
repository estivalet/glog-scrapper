{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Fighter", "overview": "What do you get when you cross an RPG with a Fighting game - The Fighter. The Fighter is a very easy game to learn. You are given a menu of fighting moves and all you have to do is choose the move you want to use. What makes this game really fun and interesting is that as you go down the list, each one is more powerful but conversely less likely to hit. For instance, racking your enemy would effect him more than a punch but it is a more difficult move to pull off.
