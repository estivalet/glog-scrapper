{"altername_name": ["BrainStorm128"], "name": "BrainStorm 128", "overview": "Welcome to Brainstorm128! This program will \"learn\" the vocabulary you feed it (Okay, so it *doesn't* learn--it merely stores words in a database) and attempt to randomize the words and display a useful sentence. It is menu- driven, so you don't have to remember complex keys and commands. Its func- tionality should be self-explanatory, so it shouldn't be hard to use. Keep in mind that, like fortune-tellers and AI progrms, this program is merely a TOY. This means that you can't expect good results all of the time.", "platform": "Commodore 128", "release_date": "January 11, 2015", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Joseph Rose", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Party", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/159833-brainstorm-128\n"}
