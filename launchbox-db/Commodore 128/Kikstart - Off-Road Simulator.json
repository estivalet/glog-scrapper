{"altername_name": ["Kikstart 128", "Kikstart 2"], "name": "Kikstart: Off-Road Simulator", "overview": "Between the original Kikstart and its more well-known follow-up came an expanded version of the game, only for Commodore's still-new C128 computer. The new version made use of the larger RAM capacity by tripling the range of levels in the game. Whereas the first Kikstart only has 8 levels to choose from, Kikstart 128 has three sets of 8 levels. You can choose to play three levels in one go, or select the \"grand slam\" mode to challenge an entire set of eight at once. The gameplay is the same, in that you have to ride your off-road motorbike across a range of obstacles without falling off, which will cost you time. The game is a split-screen affair for one or two players. The construction kit function of the later Kikstart 2 is missing from this C128-only affair, despite the games sharing the same name on the title screen.", "platform": "Commodore 128", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mr Chip Software", "publishers": "Mastertronic Ltd.", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.9", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kikstart_2", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PubzW0irK-A", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/121470-kikstart-off-road-simulator\n"}
