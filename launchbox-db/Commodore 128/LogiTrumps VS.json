{"altername_name": [], "name": "LogiTrumps VS", "overview": "LogiTrumps is a trump card game with retro computers. It\u2019s like we used to play it in the 80's. Each player (you and the computer) gets the same number of cards. Each card represents a retro computer and has several values like year, memory and colours. Each card has its strengths and weaknesses. If a computer has a lot of memory or colours, he usually is not that old and therefor would likely lose in the year category. Usually the higher value wins. The year category is the only category where the lower value wins. The player who gets all cards first wins the game. Released at the Vintage Computing Carinthia $06. Supports both 40 and 80 Column.", "platform": "Commodore 128", "release_date": "March 21, 2020", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Logiker", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/142124-logitrumps-vs\n"}
