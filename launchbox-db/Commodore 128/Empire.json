{"altername_name": [], "name": "Empire", "overview": "This game is really bizarre and a heckuva lot of flin. It's like \"Lord of the Rings\" and \"Monopoly\" mixed together in one big smelting pot. It's also the.sort of game you'll only see in the pages of Ahoy!, because it's a real change of pace from \"kill the monster, get the treasure\" type adventure scenarios. You may find it an unsettling course in economics as well. I admit this game is a result of some reading I have been doing lately in that field. The setting for the game is a huge map of the world of Empire, a fantasy never- never land. This map contains the kingdoms of eight different warring factions, with you in the middle trying to profit from both sides and build up your own lands. The goal of the game is to acquire 100% of the Empire within one year. Each kingdom owns a separate portion of the Empire, and you will attempt to buy out their land shares with the profits you'll make wheeling and dealing in the various population centers.", "platform": "Commodore 128", "release_date": "October 5, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Cleve Blakemore", "publishers": "Ion International, Inc.", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/160019-empire\n"}
