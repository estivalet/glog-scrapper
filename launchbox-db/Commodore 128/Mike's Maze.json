{"altername_name": ["Mikes Maze 128"], "name": "Mike's Maze", "overview": "A game where you must make your way safely out of the maze, seen in bird's eye view. Mike's Maze is a maze game for the Commodore 128 in 40 columns that resulted from a discussion of random numbers. The file is only 12 blocks long; however, you won't believe the fun you can have as a result of those 12 nicely coded blocks! The game displays a large maze on the screen. You are the black dot located at the bottom right of the display. The object is to reach the end of the maze. Due to the complexity of some of these mazes, you may find that quite a challenge in itself. Additionally, if you happen to touch the side of the maze you'll instantly be zapped back to the start of the maze. Finish the maze and you'll advance to an all new more challenging level.
