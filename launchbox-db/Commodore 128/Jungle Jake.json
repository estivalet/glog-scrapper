{"altername_name": [], "name": "Jungle Jake", "overview": "Jungle Jake is an arcade-style game for the C-128 ^B similar to Donkey Kong and other multilevel challenges. There are seven colorful screens of challenging play, accompanied by a variety of musical scores and hyper-nervous joystick action. You may play this one for a long time before you make it to screen 7. Control Jake, a safari explorer with the power to make Olympic-quality high jumps over obstacles. His mission is to save Clarinda from the evil baddies who have captured her and are boiling her for dinner in the upper left hand comer of the screen. Move Jake left or right to get to the vines at the end of each platform, so he can climb up to the next canopy. To leap over the many predators Jake will encounter during his adventure, push the fire button. To save Clarinda, leap to the edge of the pot she is in and touch her, avoiding the smoking coals beneath. The lovers will be temporarily reunited, but Clarinda will vanish from Jake's arms afterwards to appear on the next level.", "platform": "Commodore 128", "release_date": "January 4, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Cleveland M.
