{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mondo Crypto", "overview": "C128 only. Included in Loadstar 128 #21. The game works in 80-columns mode. To enter a cryptogram from the newspaper just type it in just as it is presented. Then you'll be able to move a white cursor over each letter of the code, entering your guesses. SPACE will erase a letter. You may SAVE and LOAD the current cryptogram. MONDO presents you with eight words at a time chosen at random from the dictionary on disk. The words have been encrypted with a Simple substitution code, where every letter is represented by a different letter. All eight words use the same code. There are two types of clues. One letter of each word is identified, and all letters that appear only once in all eight words are given. You may get a letter hint by placing the cursor above a letter and pressing F1. It costs you one word. You have ten Minutes to solve as many words as you can.", "platform": "Commodore 128", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Fender Tucker", "publishers": "J & F Publishing, Inc.", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/368478-mondo-crypto\n"}
