{"altername_name": [], "name": "Archer", "overview": "Archer, a multilevel tribute to the arcade milestone called Venture. The first thing you'll always see is a large overview of the dungeon level you're on first, with the little green face representing you. Guide the Archer to the doors of each of the rooms in the dungeon while dodging Loog and Moog, two troll sentries you'd do well to avoid, because your arrows will never pierce their rough hide. Upon your first entry into any dungeon level , the floor will be littered with a sampling of diamonds which you can pick up as you go for bonus points, each diamond worth LEVELX50. Each dungeon has several different rooms, each possessing a different treasure. You must penetrate each room and collect the treasures before the doors to the staircase at the upper left will open, enabling you to descend to the next level. Each time you pick up a treasure, it will appear in the \"booty\" bracket at the bottom of the screen. Notice that when you reemerge into the large scale map, Loog and Moog have gathered up any diamonds remaining. The value of the treasures you collect depends on the level and type of menace in the room. Each dungeon creature you kill is worth LEVEL X 1000. You can elect just to collect treasure, or go for the points and try to clean out the rooms of monsters as you progress.", "platform": "Commodore 128", "release_date": "August 3, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Cleve Blakemore", "publishers": "Ion International, Inc.", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.12", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/160017-archer\n"}
