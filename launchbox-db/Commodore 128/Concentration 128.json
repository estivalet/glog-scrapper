{"altername_name": [], "name": "Concentration 128", "overview": "A strategy game created by Charles Arceneaux and published in July 1987 in Loadstart #037. At the beginning of the game, all the cards are turned face down. The first player flips one card over, then another. If the symbols on the cards match the player receives one point and the cards are taken out of play. However, if the cards don't match they are turned over again and the second player gets a turn. Play continues until all cards are taken out of play. This program uses 70 cards, each marked with one of 35 symbols. Can be played in both one and two player modes. The single player game is a game against time, beat your best matching time.", "platform": "Commodore 128", "release_date": "July 1, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Charles Arceneaux", "publishers": "Softdisk Publishing, Inc.", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/166566-concentration-128\n"}
