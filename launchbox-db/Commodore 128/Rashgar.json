{"altername_name": ["Rashgar: Master of Dimension X"], "name": "Rashgar", "overview": "Rashgar is the immortal champion of the X dimension and keeper of the gate through reality. Nobody knows how long Rashgar has been there, guarding the locus of the X dimension against the evil Crystallions, the race who would break through the barrier and destroy the universe. He cannot be annihilated, only temporarily disembodied. The object is to guard the center of the screen (and yourself) from the Crystallions, spinning, constantly pulsating crystals that float dreamily through the domain of Rashgar. To destroy one of these creatures, center the target cross hair on it using the joystick and press the fire button. Rash- gar's eyes light up with fury, and a lance of energy leaps from his mouth and blasts the menace into subatomic vapor. Both the cross hair movement and the laser beam wrap around the screen.", "platform": "Commodore 128", "release_date": "June 6, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Cleveland M.
