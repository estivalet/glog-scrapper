{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hydra", "overview": "Hydra is a puzzle game for your Commodore 128, where you have to recreate the multi-limb \u201chydra\u201d by rotating the puzzle blocks back to their proper positions. The game utilizes the 128's 80 column mode, and you have the option of playing the game using the keyboard, joystick or mouse. The game offers six different sizes of Hydra's and five puzzles to solve for each size. There's also five blank puzzles for you to design your own puzzles, with the built-in editor. The game-play is simple, but very challenging; especially if you're playing against the clock. You use the mouse, joystick, or keyboard to move the pointer to the tiles you want to re-position. Wit the mouse, you use the left and right mouse buttons to rotate the tile either clockwise or counter-clockwise. If you use the keyboard or joystick, you rotate the tiles clockwise with either the space bar or fire-button.", "platform": "Commodore 128", "release_date": "1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Knees Calhoun", "publishers": "J & F Publishing, Inc.", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/159778-hydra\n"}
