{"altername_name": [], "name": "Magic Blocks", "overview": "Here's a challenging little puzzle game for your C128 where you have to strategically remove and place \u201cmagic blocks\u201d to collect the objects and the key that unlocks the door to the next level. You collect the bubbles (or discs, or coins, or what ever they are) for points, and you must collect the key in order to unlock the door to the next level. However, keep an eye on the timer. If you run out of time, you lose a life and start all over from the beginning. You control the little magician Archimedes with the joystick. You press the fire button to collect blocks, one at a time. Then, use the fire button again to place the blocks in arrangements that allow you to climb and reach the different areas of the room. Blocks can be placed anywhere, one space left or right of the space your standing in, as long as there's nothing else occupying the same space.", "platform": "Commodore 128", "release_date": "2018", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Roland", "publishers": "RK Soft", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/159785-magic-blocks\n"}
