Careless experimentation with the newly operational SDI weaponry in space has fractured a major asteroid close to the Earth! The stray pieces have fallen toward Terra after being captured in our gravitational field. Now the Earth's greatest scientists have joined forces to construct a massive particle beam weapon at Cape Kennedy in Florida. You are the weapon's controller. Using your precise knowledge of trajectory and velocity, you must shoot down all three chunks of orbiting space debris before they collide with our planet's surface, killing thousands!", "platform": "Commodore 128", "release_date": "November 9, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Cleveland M.
