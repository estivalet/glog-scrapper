{"altername_name": [], "name": "Planet Duel", "overview": "The energy gauge is sputtering on empty after a massive hit under your fuselage by a nuke. Your right engine is smoking. Your shields are out. You know if you sustain any more damage, you and your ship will be toast floating over the rocky terrain below. You're betting if you can just make it to the Mycho Braha Valley, youll be able to lure the enemy ship into the trench under the natural bridge there, pull out, and hit him from above with a counter strike. It's one chance in a million, but what do you have to lose? If only you'd spent a little more money on your armor shielding. . . Where is that alien scum, anyway? Hey! He's right behind you! He's firing his torpedoes!
