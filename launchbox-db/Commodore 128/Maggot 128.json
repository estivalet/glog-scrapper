{"altername_name": [], "name": "Maggot 128", "overview": "Maggot by Peter Karlsson is a mini game for the Commodore 128 (40 column mode) released for the Minigame 2002 Compo. You are a worm (or maggot, in this case), and your aim is to eat as many targets as possible. Whenever you eat a target, the worm grows. If you run into the walls or yourself, the game is over. The game is controlled with the numbers on the numerical keypad: 8 for up, 4 for left, 6 for right and 2 for down. Any other key makes the worm stop, which means instant Game Over!", "platform": "Commodore 128", "release_date": "2002", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Peter Karlsson", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/159827-maggot-128\n"}
