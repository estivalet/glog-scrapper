{"altername_name": [], "name": "Galactic Cab Co.", "overview": "Cab twelve! Get down to the Miner's Complex Cavern on the double. They have a bunch of workers changing shifts who need a ride up to the mothership! You groaned. The Miner's Industrial Complex Cavern was a dangerous, tricky labyrinth underneath the planet's surface that required nerves of steel to navigate. More than one cabby had bought the form trying to pick up fares on some of the more narrow platforms. But you knew the money was good, if you didn't get too greedy and overload the cab. Galactic Cab Co. is a very difficult \"lunar lander\" type game that takes place inside a massive cavern underneath the surface of a planet. The object of the game is to pick up as many people as possible and ferry them through the huge exit at the top. The cavern is enclosed by two steel doors, and the guards are very energy-conscious. They will only open the sliding doors when you have three or more passengers onboard your cab.", "platform": "Commodore 128", "release_date": "June 1, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Cleve Blakemore", "publishers": "Ion International, Inc.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/160016-galactic-cab-co\n"}
