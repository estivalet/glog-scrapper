{"altername_name": ["Simulated Evolution: Darwinian Bugs"], "name": "Darwin's Bugs", "overview": "This program demonstrates how evolution can be observed within a Microscopic world, created by a computer program. The basic concept was outlined in Scientific, American magazine, May 1989. The Microcosm consists of a pond, patrolled by bugs of an indeterminate type. As they swim around the pond, they encounter randomly placed bacteria, which they eat, thus gaining the energy they need to multiply. Bugs will evolve new, more successful swimming patterns that increase their food supply. For More details see the writeup, or read Scientific American. For the C128 only. Included in Loadstar 128 #12. The game works in 80-columns mode; the 40-columns screen shows the graphics and the 80-columns shows the command lines.", "platform": "Commodore 128", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ian Adam", "publishers": "J & F Publishing, Inc.", "genres": "Life Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/368449-darwins-bugs\n"}
