{"altername_name": ["Adventure", "Colossal Cave Revisited 128"], "name": "Colossal Cave Adventure", "overview": "Colossal Cave Adventure, aka Adventure, the original 350 points version ported to Inform by Graham Nelson, based on Dave Baggett's TADS reconstruction Colossal Cave Revisited. Release 3 Serial number 951220. Ported to the Commodore 128 for 40/80 Column by Lee Burt aka Thanatos916. This was the first adventure game; the whole genre is named after it. Without it, Infocom would have been just another maker of business software, Sierra On-line would be primarily known for adaptations of coin-op video game. A detailed description of this game's history and significance can be found in Graham Nelson's \"The Craft of Adventure\". Ignoring the profound historical significance for a moment, it's a treasure hunt in a cave, like most of the early adventures (including Zork). It has a verb-noun parser, minimal detail, two big annoying mazes, magic words, nonsense puzzles, and occasional death without warning. None of this matters. Download it anyway. You cannot consider yourself a true adventurer until you've played this game.", "platform": "Commodore 128", "release_date": "February 18, 2021", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dave Baggett", "publishers": "", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/160434-colossal-cave-adventure\n"}
