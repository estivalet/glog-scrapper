{"altername_name": [], "name": "Lunar Buggy", "overview": "In the year 2009 A.D. it was discovered that a colony of extraterrestrials had established itself on the dark side of the moon. A Russian installation was attacked and totally obliterated in 2011 when it attempted to approach the alien base to make contact. Following that incident, a United Nations security resolution places the aliens' location off limits to all international teams until further notice, for fear of antagonizing the otherworldly visitors. You are a government agent assigned to a secret mission of the highest priority: to recover one of the greatest of all historical artifacts, the Apollo lunar buggy. If you can drive the vehicle over the treacherous lunar plain and past the alien forces, the buggy can be returned to the Smithsonian Museum for posterity. It seems like an impossible gamble, but you know it will be worth it if you can recover this national treasure.", "platform": "Commodore 128", "release_date": "July 5, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Cleveland M.
