Akalabeth: World of Doom (1979) by Richard Garriott, ported to the Commodore 128 (VIC II/40 column mode) in pure MS BASIC 7.0 This is a single-file almost line-by-line conversion of the original Apple II source found here: https://archive.org/details/a2_Akalabeth_1980_California_Pacific_Computer_a There are already better conversions for the Commodore 64, but the purpose of this exercise was not to compete with them. Instead, noting the similarities between the two versions of BASIC, the goal was simply to create a conversion that was as close to the original code as possible. Controls had to be remapped due to the different keyboard layout: Move North/forward: cursor up OR 'O' Move East/turn right: cursor right OR 'L' Move West/turn left: cursor left OR 'K' Move South/backwards: cursor down OR ',' Attack: 'A' Stats: 'S' Enter: 'X' Pause: 'P' Pass: space bar OR escape", "platform": "Commodore 128", "release_date": "March 31, 2022", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Fox Cunning", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKm_pK6ec9k", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/168025-akalabeth-world-of-doom\n"}
