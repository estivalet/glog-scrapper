It's a text adventure game, but it has an interface that makes it easier to keep track of your inventory and your movements. Log of the 5.5. Mercury: 01/08/2176 While continuing a probe of the mostly unexplored Cerulean Arm, i received a UFP distress call. Tracing it back to The Source, I discovered the wreck of the Copernicus, a surveyship that was also studying the region. I\u00b4m preparing to dock with the vessel in hopes of finding survivors, or at least some reason for the disaster. Log will continue thereafter. Hopefully... you mutter as you slump back in the comfortably worn Command chair of the Mercury.", "platform": "Commodore 128", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jon Mattson", "publishers": "Softdisk Publishing", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/128403-the-wreck-of-the-ss-copernicus\n"}
