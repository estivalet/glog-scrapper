{"name": "Motocross Championship", "overview": "Motocross Championship is the only dirtbike racing game for the 32X. The action takes place from a behind-the-bike perspective, and makes use of the 32X's hardware bitmap scaling to present a 3D graphical effect. Like the title suggests, the main game mode is a points based championship. You can compete in one of 3 motorcycle classes over 12 indoor and outdoor tracks. There's also two player split screen mode so you can share off-road fun with a friend.", "platform": "Sega 32X", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Artech", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.33", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motocross_Championship", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSa9EHK83pM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/8739\n"}
