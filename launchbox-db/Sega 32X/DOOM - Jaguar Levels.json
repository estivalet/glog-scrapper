{"name": "DOOM: Jaguar Levels", "overview": "takes the original 32X Doom and adds in all the previously missing levels from the Atari Jaguar version of Doom as well as the BFG 9000 weapon. To check out the new levels ported from the Jaguar version of Doom j\ufeffust select Level 16 from the title menu and enjoy! It fixes the two biggest issues with the game, adding in the 7 missing levels from the Atari Jaguar version and the previously absent BFG 9000 weapon, but it still has all the other more minor issues that the 32X port of Doom is known for. It still runs in a bordered screen and still has some graphical glitches like the sprites for the rockets coming out of the rocket launcher backwards and Doomguy's hair randomly flipping around in the portrait at the bottom of the screen, but those were always pretty minor to me. For reference, the new levels included in JagDoom 32X are: Level 16: Tower of Babel Level 17: Hell Keep Level 18: Pandemonium Level 19: House of Pain Level 20: Unholy Cathedral Level 21: Mt.
