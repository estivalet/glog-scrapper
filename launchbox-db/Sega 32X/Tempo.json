{"name": "Tempo", "overview": "Tempo is a grasshopper who lives on Planet Rythmia, the world of music. Unfortunately, the malevolent King Dirge is trying to steal all the rhythm from the planet. It's unclear as to how a creature with no appreciation for music became King, but it's up to Tempo to stop him! Tempo's game is a side scrolling platformer with 7 levels. It's a single player game, although you can collect \"dance\" power-ups that allow you to call your friend, a butterfly, to help you defeat your enemies using killer dance moves.", "platform": "Sega 32X", "release_date": "March 24, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Red Company", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.46", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempo_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AmpliS2xzA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4673\n"}
