{"name": "WWF WrestleMania: The Arcade Game", "overview": "WWF WrestleMania: The Arcade Game merges the personalities and action of the WWF TV show characters with a Mortal Kombat-style fighting game. This title features digitized graphics of 8 WWF superstars: Doink, Razor Ramon, Bret \"Hit Man\" Hart, Shawn Michaels, The Undertaker, Yokozuna, Bam Bam Bigelow, and Lex Luger. Although presented as a wrestling title, this game is structured like a one-on-one fighter, features over-the-top special moves characteristic of WWF. Each match is divided into a series of rounds, much like a fighting game. Instead of each round ending in a KO, it simply ends when the player forces the other wrestler(s) to fall by reducing their energy meter. Game modes include single player arcade mode, tournament mode, and versus mode for one-on-one multiplayer.", "platform": "Sega 32X", "release_date": "November 1, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Sculptured Software", "publishers": "Acclaim", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.64", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWF_WrestleMania:_The_Arcade_Game", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1vqjvhi4YE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/13787\n"}
