{"name": "DOOM 64 32X", "overview": "DOOM 64 picks up where all the other DOOM games left off. After tearing through space, hell, and wherever else in the previous games, the Space Marine thought that the threat of the demons was finally past. Of course, one survived, and it is currently reanimating all of the fallen monsters in a last-ditch attempt to revitalize their evil mission. The player's task is to finally rid the universe of all the crazy hellions, from the dead guy with the pistol to the rocket-spewing Cyberdemon.", "platform": "Sega 32X", "release_date": "", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.64", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a2bOXHzIAw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/119530\n"}
