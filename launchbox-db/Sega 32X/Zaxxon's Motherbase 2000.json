{"name": "Zaxxon's Motherbase 2000", "overview": "This 32X-exclusive sci-fi shooter is similar gameplay-wise to Sega's arcade game Zaxxon. The graphics consist of a diagonally scrolling playfield which creates a pseudo 3D environment. The backgrounds are drawn using 2D scrolling planes, but the enemy and ship objects are drawn using 3D flat-shaded polygons. Although the basic goal of each of the 9 levels is to shoot everything without getting shot, the game has a strategic element. Your basic spacecraft has very little firepower, and can only sustain one hit. To make matters worse, there are very few power-ups. In order to survive, you have to jump on top of enemies and take control of their weapons systems. This system allows for a large variety of player-controllable ships.", "platform": "Sega 32X", "release_date": "June 1, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "CSK Research Institute Corp.", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.54", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaxxon%27s_Motherbase_2000", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKqHbZDJSPY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/8745\n"}
