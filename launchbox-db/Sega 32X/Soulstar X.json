{"name": "Soulstar X", "overview": "Soulstar was a Mega-CD game created by Core Design, and after its release, two seperate conversions were planned. One was a port to the Jaguar CD, under the same name, whereas the other was an updated version for the 32X, under the name Soulstar X. In the end, neither of them were released. The 32X update was previewed in Sega Power\u2019s August 1995 issue, but some of the screenshots provided are a bit suspect; At least one of them is identical to a screenshot used on Wikipedia (at the time of writing) to demonstrate the unreleased Jaguar version\u2026 Did Sega Power simply get screenshots from the Jaguar CD version due to a lack of available 32X screens? It\u2019s difficult to say, but the preview does confirm a few things about the 32X update, specifically the addition of multiplayer, and a faster game overall. The game looks slightly better than the Mega-CD original.", "platform": "Sega 32X", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Core Design", "publishers": "", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.56", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soulstar#Soulstar_X", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFJzbUc1Q0k", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/45752\n"}
