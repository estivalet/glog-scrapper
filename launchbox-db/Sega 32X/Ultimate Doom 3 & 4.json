{"name": "Ultimate Doom 3 & 4", "overview": "After some hours work I Finally port also Ultimate Doom episodes 3 & 4 on 32x with minimum removals as promise before. All Maps are as original PC Doom. Map06 is E3M3 and Map03 E3M6 (change position just when you access secret level from map03 and finish it you will direct to map04 by 32x doom engine) Map 24 is the first secret level (episode 3) and Map 16 the second secret level (episode 4 - need to access it from menu). Map 17 to 22 are just short levels with instance exit just not to left empty maps. Generally almost all episode 4 was very painful port. Due to 32x limitation (not only map size, also has limitation at half walls-freeze 32x- and does not support fast functions like opening door fast and not support switch with key) needed to replace fast functions and modify maps to run. Some maps may have slowdowns.", "platform": "Sega 32X", "release_date": "June 29, 2020", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "e-Doctor", "publishers": "", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.8", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133788\n"}
