The fighters and arenas are rendered in flat-shaded polygons. Unlike many fighting games, Virtua Fighter focuses on deep gameplay based on actual fighting styles, rather than outrageous special moves and story lines. There are 8 fighters to choose from in Virtua Fighter, and an equal number of fighting backdrops in which to compete. Each fighter has a distinctive fighting style, and their own set of signature moves.", "platform": "Sega 32X", "release_date": "October 10, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Sega CS R&D", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.76", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtua_Fighter", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vH1rP_e9h4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4674\n"}
