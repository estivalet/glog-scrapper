{"altername_name": [], "name": "Chinese Checkers", "overview": "Chinese Checkers is a digital version of the popular German board game originally known as Stern-Halma. The objective is to be the first player to move a group of 10 pieces to the opposite side of a star-shaped board; pieces can either be moved a single space, or 'jumped' over adjacent pieces. The game can be played in either its 2-player or 3-player variant, but only a single human player can play in a given game; other slots are filled by computer-controlled opponents. It is possible to set the number of rounds in the game, as well as also watch the computer play against itself.", "platform": "Watara Supervision", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sachen", "publishers": "Sachen", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.88", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83980-chinese-checkers\n"}
