{"altername_name": [], "name": "Kabi Island: Gold in Island", "overview": "Kabi-Island is a top-down action game that plays like Bomberman. Each stage is filled with blocks and enemies, both of which can be blown up using bombs. Blocks may contain power-ups -- such as power boosts, additional bombs, speed shoes, or remote bombs -- or one of the gold bars that are needed to complete each stage. The goal of each stage is to collect enough gold bars, which will end the stage immediately. Enemies can be defeated with a single bomb blast, but can also defeat the hero just as easily. The game includes five different worlds, each with their own enemy types and setting.", "platform": "Watara Supervision", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Thin Chen Enterprise", "publishers": "Watara", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnsHkD1AvgI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/79927-kabi-island-gold-in-island\n"}
