Over the course of the game, the monkey king Sun Wukong and his allies, Zhu Bajie and Sha Wujing, must fight through the many monsters and demons that interfere with their quest to reach India and collect the Buddhist sacred texts. The majority of the game consists of one-on-one duels against various, powerful enemies. Each enemy must be defeated before moving on to the next.
