{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sonny Xpress", "overview": "Sonny Xpress is a mail-delivery action game starring the titular Sonny, a monkey who rides a moped. The player controls Sonny as he rides around town delivering packages. To do so, he must first go to the post office and pick up a package, then check the map for his destination, and then finally ride there and make the delivery before starting over again. He must also be mindful of his surroundings, as there are dangerous cars and many other obstacles, and one hit will wreck his ride. Delivering packages earns money, which must be deposited in the bank in order to save it. Money can also be used to refuel the moped, and also to pay traffic fines at the police office. Ignoring traffic signs such as red lights and stop signs will land Sonny with a stiff fine that must be repaid.", "platform": "Watara Supervision", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Watara", "publishers": "Watara", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83974-sonny-xpress\n"}
