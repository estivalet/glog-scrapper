{"altername_name": [], "name": "Fatal Craft", "overview": "Fatal Craft is a horizontally-scrolling shooter modeled after Konami's seminal arcade classic Gradius, right down to the enemy formations and power-up system. As in most any scrolling shoot-'em-up, the goal is to reach the end of each stage and destroy the boss, defeating enemies and collecting power-ups along the way. Some enemies drop capsules, which when collected will increment the power-up bar at the bottom of the screen; press the power-up button to collect the selected item and reset the bar. There are six types of upgrades available, including a speed-up, a shield, three types of weapon upgrades, and an Option unit that mimic's the ship's movement, providing another source of fire.", "platform": "Watara Supervision", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Bon Treasure", "publishers": "Watara", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90481-fatal-craft\n"}
