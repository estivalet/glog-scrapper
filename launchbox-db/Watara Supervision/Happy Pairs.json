{"altername_name": [], "name": "Happy Pairs", "overview": "Happy Pairs is a tile-matching puzzle game based on the Japanese game Shisensh\u014d. Similar to the well-known Shanghai, the object is to remove tiles from the board in matching pairs until the entire board is clear. Pairs can only be removed if they can be connected by a line with no more than two turns. The game is timed, and if the time runs out, the puzzle must be restarted. It is also possible to have the computer find a match for you, but this can only be done a limited number of times. The game includes more than a dozen different backgrounds, each representing a different location around the world, and several dozen different puzzle layouts to solve.", "platform": "Watara Supervision", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sachen", "publishers": "Watara", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83984-happy-pairs\n"}
