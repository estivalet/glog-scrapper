The game plays similarly to the NES version of Konami's classic, offering punches and kicks at two different heights, plus flying jump kicks and wall bounces. A variety of different opponents must be defeated, including a ninja, a fencer, and a boxer, who each have their own fighting styles and techniques. If the player loses too many bouts, the game is over with no option to continue.", "platform": "Watara Supervision", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Thin Chen Enterprise", "publishers": "Watara", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeaLF9slCcA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83989-kung-fu-street\n"}
