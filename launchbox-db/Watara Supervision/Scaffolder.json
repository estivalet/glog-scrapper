{"altername_name": [], "name": "Scaffolder", "overview": "Scaffolder is a block puzzle game. Each puzzle consists of a set of blocks, which must be disassembled so that every block lies directly on the floor. The blocks are fragile, and if they fall more than one tile at a time, they will break and the puzzle will be failed. The player controls a man who can push and pull these blocks, as well as jump around the stage, who must also be careful not to let himself be crushed by the blocks. There are two different modes: beginner mode features relatively easy puzzles with no time limit, while skilled mode includes harder puzzles that must be completed within a time limit.
