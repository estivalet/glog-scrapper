{"altername_name": [], "name": "Galaxy Fighter", "overview": "Galaxy Fighter is a vertically-scrolling space shooter. Many kinds of enemies appear in waves to attack the player, piloting an advanced fighter ship. When destroyed, enemies will sometimes drop power-up items, which include firepower upgrades and three different types of sub weapon: small homing missiles, large forward-firing missiles, and a rotating shield that damages nearby enemies. Every so often, a large boss enemy will appear, which must be destroyed in order to proceed. Similar to Toaplan's Truxton, there are no breaks between stages; the entire game scrolls continuously forward, only interrupted when the player's ship is destroyed.", "platform": "Watara Supervision", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Thin Chen Enterprise", "publishers": "Watara", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.12", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A887C2L9sQI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90482-galaxy-fighter\n"}
