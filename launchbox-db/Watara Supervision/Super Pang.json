{"altername_name": [], "name": "Super Pang", "overview": "Super Pang is a clone of the arcade game of the same title. The premise is simple: there are balloons bouncing around a room, and you must shoot and destroy them without getting hit. However, it's not that simple; when shot, the balloons will split into two smaller balloons, and only the smallest size will be destroyed when hit. There are several power-ups that will randomly appear to aid the player, including long-lasting shots, quick-fire shots, and scrolls that instantly reduce all balloons on the screen to the smallest size. Pop enough balloons to move onto the next stage.", "platform": "Watara Supervision", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sachen", "publishers": "Watara", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/84008-super-pang\n"}
