The player controls a paddle at the bottom of the screen, and must bounce a ball off the bricks on the screen, with the goal of destroying them all. Destroying certain bricks will release power-ups or release enemies that wander the screen. If the ball falls out the bottom of the screen, a life is lost, and if all lives are lost, the game is over.", "platform": "Watara Supervision", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bon Treasure", "publishers": "Watara", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/84017-crystball\n"}
