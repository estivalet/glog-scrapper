{"altername_name": [], "name": "Police Bust", "overview": "Police Bust is a dot-collecting maze game in the tradition of Pac-Man. The player controls a fugitive who is being chased by two police officers. He must collect all the dots strewn about a maze while avoiding capture. To aid in the escape, the player has access to barriers which will block the officers' path, as well as bombs which will stun them for a short time, but both items are in limited supply. Collect all the dots to move on to the next stage.", "platform": "Watara Supervision", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bon Treasure", "publishers": "Watara", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldBDAkmjNpw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/84000-police-bust\n"}
