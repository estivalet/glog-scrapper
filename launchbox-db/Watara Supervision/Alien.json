The game scrolls continuously to the right, while enemies attack the player by either shooting or attempting to crash into the player's craft. The player can fire normal shots, or charge up to fire an extra powerful shot, which is required to defeat certain types of enemies. At the end of each stage, a large boss enemy appears, which must be defeated to continue the game.", "platform": "Watara Supervision", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Watara", "publishers": "Watara", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.05", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83975-alien\n"}
