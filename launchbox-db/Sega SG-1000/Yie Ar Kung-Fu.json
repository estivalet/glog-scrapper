{"name": "Yie Ar Kung-Fu", "overview": "Yie Ar Kung-Fu (\u30a4\u30fc\u30fb\u30a2\u30eb\u30fb\u30ab\u30f3\u30d5\u30fc) is an early arcade versus fighting game developed by Konami. It was set to appear on the SG-1000, but was cancelled for unknown reasons, most likely due to the system's declining popularity at that time.<br><br>Despite this, an SG-1000 port of the game was released in Taiwan by Aaronix, under the localised name of G\u014dngfu (\u529f\u592b). It is based on the MSX version, and therefore only uses one button. It is not known whether Aaronix had the rights to bring the game to the system - it is likely an unlicensed version of the game of which Aaronix ported to the system themselves, but it may be a continuation of the scrapped official port.", "platform": "Sega SG-1000", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "", "developers": "Aaronix", "publishers": "Aaronix", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/149952"}
