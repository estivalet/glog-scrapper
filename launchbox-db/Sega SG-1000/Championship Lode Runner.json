{"name": "Championship Lode Runner", "overview": "A follow-up to the original Lode Runner, with identical gameplay. This package contained 50 of the most challenging levels ever designed, and was intended for expert players only. It did not include the level editor, you had to play through the levels in order, but a save-game option was provided (although you lost one life every time you restored).", "platform": "Sega SG-1000", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Br\u00f8derbund", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1apm0fDLRc4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/77210"}
