{"name": "Cabbage Patch Kids", "overview": "It's exercise time! Anna Lee, one of the Cabbage Patch Kids, is warming up for a day of athletic adventures in the park--and she's taking you along! So stretch your muscles and get ready for a workout. This adventure is no picnic! As you stroll through the park, you'll encounter obstacles they never told you about in the Cabbage Patch. You'll leap onto floating lily pads, jump over cabbages and bouncing balls, and hop over puddles so deep they could float a ship. And that's the easy part! By the time you get back to the Park entrance, you'll know just what kind of physical shape you're really in. Are you ready for the workout?", "platform": "Sega SG-1000", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Aaronix", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKkzG961EOk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/110698"}
