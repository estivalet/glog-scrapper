{"name": "Pachinko", "overview": "Pachinko is an SG-1000 game developed and published by Sega in 1983. It is, as the name suggests, a video game version of Pachinko, a popular game in Japan. The game did not see an international release.<br><br>Pachinko is an extremely rare game for the SG-1000. Soon after release, it was recalled from sale due to a game-breaking bug and very few copies remain in the hands of collectors. This is probably the very first instance of a recall in Sega's history.<br><br>The bug was fixed and the game was re-released a few weeks later as a \"sequel\", Pachinko II, which is much more common.", "platform": "Sega SG-1000", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Casino", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7iJD-LNcsQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/57614"}
