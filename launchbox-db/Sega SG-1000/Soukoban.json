{"name": "Soukoban", "overview": "Soukoban is a classic puzzle game, the basis of numerous clones in the later years. It is set in a warehouse. On each level, the player must push crates (from square to square) to get them onto designated spots; once each crate is on a marked spot, the level is complete. Crates can only be pushed one at a time (so two crates next to each other cannot be pushed together), and cannot be pulled--so it's possible to get a crate stuck in a corner, where it cannot be retrieved!", "platform": "Sega SG-1000", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2mIuUxIRKA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/57716"}
