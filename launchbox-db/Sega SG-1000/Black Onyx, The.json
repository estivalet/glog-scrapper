{"name": "The Black Onyx", "overview": "The Black Onyx is one of the first traditional role-playing games made by a Japanese company. It is similar in gameplay to early Wizardry and Ultima games with killing monsters and exploring dungeons, with dark, realistic visuals. The player creates a party (up to five members) and explores a maze-like 3D dungeon, fighting random enemies on the way. The heroes also meet adventurers who can be convinced to join the party. The combat engine is turn-based.", "platform": "Sega SG-1000", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.28", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmdKAkcubvE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/47159"}
