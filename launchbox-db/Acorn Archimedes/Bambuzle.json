{"name": "Bambuzle", "overview": "A Tetris inspired game where objects appear at the top of the screen and you have to manipulate them into the right positions.<br>Each of the 50 levels is a layout of tubes which lead to bearings with four indentation; the goal is to fill each one with a ball of the same colour. Those bearings can be spun to send balls another way and explode when they are full. Each level has to be solved within a time limit and there are some special obstacles to take into consideration, e.g. tubes which only let through balls of a certain colour or paint pots which change the colour of a passing ball. A password is rewarded for each finished level.", "platform": "Acorn Archimedes", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Kuldip S.
