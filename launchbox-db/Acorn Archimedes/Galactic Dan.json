{"name": "Galactic Dan", "overview": "A stunning ray traced 3D combat adventure.<br><br>Galactic Dan is an early first person shooter featuring ray traced graphics. The game is controlled with the mouse that the player uses to shoot, run, jump and look around. There are 24 maze-like levels and the objective of each of them is to rescue a set number of hostages and find the exit before the time runs out. At the same time the player has to shoot down or avoid the many enemies that guard the hostages. The mission is failed when the player's energy reaches zero or when time runs out. The player gets a score based on how hostages are rescued, enemies killed and time left. It's possible to save more hostages than are required to finish the level.", "platform": "Acorn Archimedes", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Ian Holmes", "publishers": "The Fourth Dimension", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/80006"}
