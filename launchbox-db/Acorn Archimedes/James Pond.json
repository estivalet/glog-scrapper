{"name": "James Pond", "overview": "\"James Pond\" is (obviously) a parody on the famous agent 007 stories. You control Pond, a fish-like creature, who has to complete several missions, while making his way through levels full of dangers and hostile creatures. It is not a typical \"jump and run\" game: instead of breezing through large levels, Pond has to complete unique missions for each game area: free hostages, detonate a structure, find keys, etc. It is possible to exit a level only after having completed the objective. Many missions are timed.", "platform": "Acorn Archimedes", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "VectorDean", "publishers": "Krisalis Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxgByEHBdbI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/80031"}
