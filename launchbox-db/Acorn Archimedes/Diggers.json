To do so, you must sell your collected treasure to the bank.<br><br>You select your \"Diggers\" by clicking on them with the left mouse button, and making them do a desired action by right-clicking on the screen and choosing from a icon menu.<br><br>Each clan has different characteristics and stats: for example the Grablins clan resembles fantasy dwarfs and has the fastest diggers.
