{"name": "All-In Boxing", "overview": "Let's get ready to Ruuuummmmblllle!!!<br><br><br><br>Designed and programmed by Mark Dixon from Arc systems and Alien Images, All in Boxing is a fighting game that just can't be beat! Boasting a heaving hitting roaster of 6 fighters from the unstoppable 'Willie Win', 'Ed Strong', 'Hans Full', 'B.A. Sher', 'N.O. Kowt', and the USSR brute 'Ivor Hardpunch' the fun never stops! <br><br><br><br>Once you choose your combatant it is time to train. So take to the bags, Mac, we've got work to do! But unlike your jaw you can't afford to slack-off because you only got twenty seconds before you have to make the entrance to the big match!<br><br><br><br>AND Here it is the moment we've all been waiting for, the fight of a life time that can be over as quickly as you count 7-8-9...<br><br>DING-DING DING.<br><br><br><br>In each round you are given the chance to train some more.  This gives you a boost depending how hard you work. These mini-games break up the monotony. From jumping rope to punching bags. It's just a matter of time before you pin him to the corner. <br><br><br><br>So the question is... Do you have what it takes? Do you have the eye of the tiger?", "platform": "Acorn Archimedes", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Arc System Works", "publishers": "Arc System Works", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BytjDC3VlDA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/41412"}
