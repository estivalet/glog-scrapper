{"name": "Bloxed", "overview": "Bloxed is a Tetris variant that most closely resembles the arcade game Bloxeed. The basic gameplay is the same but it adds various power ups to the game. These are called power blocks and appear randomly as part of tetrominoes and are activated when a row consisting of one is cleared. There are four different power blocks: four lines, filler, shooter, bomb and 16 ton weight. Four lines removes up to four incomplete lines from the playfield. Filler replaces the next tetromino with a little alien that the player controls and drops single blocks. It can be used to fill in holes in partially finished lines. The shooter does the opposite and shoots away unwanted blocks. The bomb is used to blow up a section of the playfield. The 16 ton weight removes three columns of blocks when dropped on the playfield.<br><br><br>The game also features a multiplayer mode where two players complete side by side on a split screen. A special feature in the multiplayer mode is that if one player completes more than one line with a piece the lines are passed to the opponent.", "platform": "Acorn Archimedes", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Steven Singer", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.32", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/108972"}
