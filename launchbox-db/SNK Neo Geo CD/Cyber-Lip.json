{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cyber-Lip", "overview": "Cyber-Lip is a horizontally scrolling, side-view platformer shoot 'em up (this combination is sometimes referred to as \"run and gun\") arcade game released by SNK in 1990 for the SNK Neo-Geo MVS. Players control Rick and/or Brook, two human veteran soldiers, who are sent by an unspecified \"federal government\" into combat on a last-ditch attempt to save Earth from a malfunctioning military supercomputer in charge of all military androids. Gameplay consists of battling through large amounts of enemies, collecting power-ups and defeating several end-of-stage bosses. This makes it comparable to the likes of Metal Slug or Contra in terms of gameplay.", "platform": "SNK Neo Geo CD", "release_date": "April 21, 1995", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "SNK", "publishers": "SNK", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.88", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86810-cyber-lip\n"}
