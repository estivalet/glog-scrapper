{"altername_name": [], "name": "Magical Drop 2", "overview": "The second game in the series moved from Data East's proprietary arcade hardware to SNK's Neo Geo. It first released in 1996. In addition to the cast of the first Magical Drop, Magical Drop II introduces Justice, as well as antagonists Strength, Empress, and Black Pierrot. One notable gameplay change is that normal bubbles and \"special\" bubbles can now be matched together, unlike the first game where they were considered completely separate. The \"Solo Play\" mode, now known as Puzzle Mode, is also changed to add more rows to the player's playfield. Finally, the Japanese version of Magical Drop II contains a third mode named Hirameki that offers preset puzzles for the player to solve.", "platform": "SNK Neo Geo CD", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Data East", "publishers": "Data East", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.17", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_Drop#Magical_Drop_II_(\u30de\u30b8\u30ab\u30eb\u30c9\u30ed\u30c3\u30d72)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86832-magical-drop-2\n"}
