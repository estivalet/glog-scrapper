Both cyborgs must cross six levels before reaching the end boss. During these levels, they will face the Professor's henchmen, as well as a sub-boss and a boss in each stage. The two heroes can of course fight with their fists and feet, but they can also defend themselves by collecting improvised weapons (car carcass, barrel, destroyed robot arm). They each have a power gauge allowing them to launch powerful attacks according to the power gained. Maxima and Rocky can also be transformed for a brief moment into an invulnerable armored vehicle.", "platform": "SNK Neo Geo CD", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "SNK", "publishers": "SNK", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.6", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robo_Army", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/87360-robo-army\n"}
