{"altername_name": [], "name": "Top Player's Golf", "overview": "Top Player's Golf is a golf arcade video game developed and originally published by SNK on May 23, 1990. It was one of the launch titles for both the Neo Geo MVS (arcade) and Neo Geo AES (home) platforms in the United States, the second golf game created by SNK after 1988's Lee Trevino's Fighting Golf, as well as one of the two golf games released for the Neo Geo, the other being Nazca Corporation's 1996 Neo Turf Masters. In the game, the players compete with either computer-controlled opponents or against other players in matches across various golf courses set in two country clubs. Despite being initially launched for the Neo Geo MVS, Top Player's Golf would be later released for both Neo Geo AES and Neo Geo CD in 1991 and 1994 respectively, and has since been re-released through download services for various consoles, among other ways to play it as of date. Top Player's Golf received mixed reception from critics after its initial launch with praise towards the presentation and digitized voice samples but many were divided in regards to the gameplay and visuals.", "platform": "SNK Neo Geo CD", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "SNK", "publishers": "SNK", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.14", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_Player%27s_Golf", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/87368-top-players-golf\n"}
