{"altername_name": [], "name": "Power Spikes II", "overview": "Power Spikes II is a 2D side-view volleyball game that presents players with three different leagues. Players can compete in either the men's league or women's league using standard volleyball rules, or in a cyber league using cybernetically enhanced players. The rules are the same for all three leagues. One team starts the game by serving the ball to the other team. As in the real sport of volleyball, the object is to hit the ball across the center net as the other team tries to do the same. If a team fails to hit the ball before it hits the ground, the team that served the ball earns a point, or earns the serve if it was on the receiving end.", "platform": "SNK Neo Geo CD", "release_date": "December 18, 1995", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Video System", "publishers": "SNK", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.11", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/87357-power-spikes-ii\n"}
