It is a sequel to Fatal Fury: King of Fighters and the second game in the Fatal Fury franchise. The player can choose one from eight playable characters: Terry Bogard, Andy Bogard, Joe Higashi, Big Bear, Jubei Yamada, Cheng Sinzan, Kim Kaphwan, and Mai Shiranui. The game has four bosses. The combat system is more complex than in the first game, supporting four keys to attack. The two-plane (foreground and background) battle system has been retained, but now, the player can move freely to the adjacent plane - just by pressing the Light Punch and Light Kick buttons simultaneously. The main principle remains the same - beat your opponent in a duel with fists and kicks.", "platform": "SNK Neo Geo CD", "release_date": "September 9, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "SNK", "publishers": "Magical Company", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.39", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatal_Fury_2", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86811-fatal-fury-2\n"}
