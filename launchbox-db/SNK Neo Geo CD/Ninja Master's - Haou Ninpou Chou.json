{"altername_name": ["Ninja Master's Haou Ninpou-Chou", "Ninja Master's: Haou Ninpou-ko"], "name": "Ninja Master's: Haou Ninpou Chou", "overview": "Ninja Master's follows the conventions of many previous 2D fighting games released for the Neo-Geo. The player must defeat their opponent in combat in a series of best-two-out-of-three matches. Characters can change between using the character's weapon or fight hand-to-hand during the middle of combat. Like the Art of Fighting series, Ninja Master's features a super meter. Another one-on-one fighting game straight from the arcades for the Neo Geo. Ninja Master's [sic] is set in feudal Japan, and tells the story of 10 unique ninjas who fight each other for their own personal reasons and the chance to defeat the evil Nobunaga and bring peace back to Japan. As expected for the genre, the game pits your selected character against a series of opponents in best-of-three-round matches, with your objective being to deplete your opponent's health bar with your basic attacks, special moves (triggered by specific control motions) and super moves (which rely on a power gauge). All the characters in Ninja Master's fight with their weapon of choice, but you can freely choose to put your weapon away and go mano-a-mano. This does not have a major impact on speed or attack power, but changes the movesets significantly, even changing the way basic attacks work. Uses 2D sprite-based graphics and features 1P or 2P vs gameplay.", "platform": "SNK Neo Geo CD", "release_date": "December 28, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "ADK", "publishers": "ADK", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.29", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/87354-ninja-masters-haou-ninpou-chou\n"}
