It is the fourth game in the Fatal Fury series after Fatal Fury Special. Fatal Fury 3 retains the format and controls of the previous game in the series, Fatal Fury Special. However, the two-plane battle stages have been revamped into a three-plane format known as the Oversway System. The player fights primarily in the middle plane or the main plane, but can move or \"oversway\" into either of the sway lines at the background (LP+LK) or foreground (LK+HP). When the player performs an attack in a sway plane (or an Oversway Attack), their character will return to the main plane. Likewise, the player can attack an opponent who is in a Sway Plane with an Anti-Oversway Attack. The player can also do a \"Quick Sway\" to avoid an attack, leaving the opponent vulnerable to a regular attack.", "platform": "SNK Neo Geo CD", "release_date": "December 27, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "SNK", "publishers": "SNK", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.04", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatal_Fury_3:_Road_to_the_Final_Victory", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86812-fatal-fury-3-road-to-the-final-victory\n"}
