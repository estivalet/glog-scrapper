{"altername_name": [], "name": "Viewpoint", "overview": "Viewpoint is an isometric-scrolling shooter arcade game developed by Aicom and originally released in 1992 by Sammy and SNK for the Neo Geo hardware family. Gameplay: Viewpoint is Sammy's only game for the Neo-Geo Multi Video System hardware. By default, Player 1 and Player 2 can only play one after another; in the Service Mode though, simultaneous gameplay can be enabled. Along with the ship's primary weapons, the player also has access to three bombs: one that can make a wave of fire that starts from behind the player's ship and scrolls \"up\" the screen, one that makes a powerful circular, nova-like blast, and one that shoots several mini-missiles capable of homing in on multiple targets. The game has six stages.", "platform": "SNK Neo Geo CD", "release_date": "November 20, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Aicom", "publishers": "Sammy", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/87369-viewpoint\n"}
