Run and gun your way through thousands of adversaries as you explore the research outpost, searching for survivors, and ultimately confronting the origin of the outpost's demise. Featuring seven areas and a legion of deadly enemies and intimidating bosses, Xeno Crisis is a formidable challenge, and you'll need to make wise use of the various weapons and upgrades to stand a chance. Only with a combination of lightning quick reactions and guile will you be able to complete your mission, but be warned - only the most adept of players will be able to see the true ending!", "platform": "SNK Neo Geo CD", "release_date": "October 1, 2021", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bitmap Bureau", "publishers": "Bitmap Bureau", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.75", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xeno_Crisis", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3UVjC311AI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/157862-xeno-crisis\n"}
