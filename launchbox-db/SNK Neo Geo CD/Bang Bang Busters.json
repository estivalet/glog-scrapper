{"altername_name": ["Bang Bang Busters", "Bang^2 Busters"], "name": "Bang Bang Busters", "overview": "After being called in on a false SOS signal, the two player characters must defeat the villainous Honey's dark army. They do so by shooting them until they inflate, then by grabbing and throwing them at other onscreen enemies. Hitting multiple enemies in a single throw results in more bonus points, and the screen will end after either all enemies have been destroyed, or after an enemy spawner is destroyed. Each stage has five screens, and every other stage ends with a fight against a durable boss character that can inflate the player character.", "platform": "SNK Neo Geo CD", "release_date": "2012", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Visco", "publishers": "Neo Conception international", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.44", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bang_Bang_Busters", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/114942-bang-bang-busters\n"}
