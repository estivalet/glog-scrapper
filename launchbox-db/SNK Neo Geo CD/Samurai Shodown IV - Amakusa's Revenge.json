{"altername_name": ["Samurai Spirits: Amakusa Kourin", "Samurai Spirits: Amakusa Kourin: Samurai Shodown IV: Amakusa's Revenge"], "name": "Samurai Shodown IV: Amakusa's Revenge", "overview": "Samurai Shodown IV: Amakusa's Revenge is the fourth in SNK's flagship Samurai Shodown series of fighting games. Chronologically, it is the second and final chapter of a story between Samurai Shodown and Samurai Shodown II, with Samurai Shodown III being the first chapter. Samurai Shodown! on the Neo Geo Pocket is a monochrome adaptation of this game, and it was followed by Samurai Shodown! 2 on the Neo Geo Pocket Color, which is a 2D adaptation of Samurai Shodown 64: Warriors Rage. Gameplay: Among other series changes, aerial blocking was removed entirely. One can also no longer charge one's own \"pow\" gauge. The off-screen delivery man was omitted entirely from the game. The \"CD combo\" was added, wherein a player can press the C and D buttons together, triggering a strike that can be followed up by a sequence of button taps. SNK also added a \"suicide\" move, wherein one's character forfeits the round. The bonus to this is that the one committing suicide will start the next round with a full \"POW\" gauge. Certain finishes also enable a \"fatality\" move in the vein of Mortal Kombat.", "platform": "SNK Neo Geo CD", "release_date": "December 27, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "SNK", "publishers": "SNK", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samurai_Shodown_IV", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86839-samurai-shodown-iv-amakusas-revenge\n"}
