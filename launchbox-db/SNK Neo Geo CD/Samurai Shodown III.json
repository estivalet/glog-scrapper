{"altername_name": ["Samurai Spirits: Zankurou Musouken", "Samurai Spirits: Zankurou Musouken: Samurai Shodown III"], "name": "Samurai Shodown III", "overview": "Samurai Shodown III: Blades of Blood was released in the arcades on November 15, 1995. It is the third game in SNK's Samurai Shodown series of fighting games. While it is the third game in the main series, it is the first part of a two-chapter story that is chronologically set between the events of Samurai Shodown and Samurai Shodown II. The game has a darker aesthetic compared to its predecessors. All characters consequently underwent a visual makeover to match this new tone. The humor that characterized the series made way for a more somber and gritty feel. Along with the aesthetic overhaul came significant changes in the gameplay with introduction of two selectable versions of each character: \"Slash\" (chivalry) and \"Bust\" (treachery). Each version comes with its own moves and fighting styles; Slash is closer to the first two games, while Bust is a more aggressive style that introduces new moves. Controls were also updated; a new layout dedicates three of four buttons to weapon attacks and one for kicking attacks, as opposed to two buttons for weapons and kicks each. Tactical changes include priority for special moves as well as replacing the free movement system with a more restrained parry system. Samurai Shodown III was released on SNK's Neo Geo AES and Neo Geo CD consoles as well as the PlayStation and Saturn systems. A Game Boy version with a slightly different roster and features was released only in Japan by Takara, a team responsible for the porting of several other SNK arcade games to consoles and handhelds. Gameplay: Compared to the others in the series, the game has a darker aesthetic. The more light-hearted characters (Earthquake, Cham Cham, and Gen-an) from the previous games have been excised, and the kabuki master, Kyoshiro Senryo, received a redesign, transforming him from a flamboyant stage performer into a grim-faced, muscular man. All of the characters have been completely redrawn. Also, the button layout was changed, mapping the first three of the four available buttons to weak, medium and strong slash attacks, respectively. The fourth button is used for kick attacks. The pace of the game shifted somewhat, as many basic attacks can be canceled into special moves, something which is extremely rare in the first two installments. Most of Samurai Shodown 2's movement options were removed, in favor of the ability to dodge attacks by pressing the A and B buttons simultaneously. When close, performing this command results in a quick switch-around to the opponent's back, which can then be followed up by other attacks. It is also possible to block attacks in mid-air. Items are also thrown onto the battlefield from off-screen as opposed from a delivery man running in the background. Along with the aesthetic overhaul came significant changes in the gameplay, such as the addition of two selectable versions of each character. Slash: Known to the Japanese as Shura (\u4fee\u7f85), from Sanskrit word \"Asura\". Originally, in Brahmanism and Hinduism, a devil who loves to fight by nature. It is occasionally mistranslated as \"Chivalry\", and implies a regular fighter (compare a face in professional wrestling). This version tends to be the closest in style and moves to the Samurai Shodown II version of the character. Bust: Known to the Japanese as Rasetsu (\u7f85\u5239), which is a derivation of the Sanskrit word, \"rakshasa\", in reference to a type of demon of black body (hence, the darker skin of bust characters). It is occasionally mistranslated as \"Treachery\", implying a rulebreaking heel version of the character. This version typically differs considerably from its Slash counterpart in gameplay, though it visually does not look different beyond its color palette. The fighter Nakoruru is the only notable exception to this. The \"Slash\" version of her character is accompanied by her pet hawk, Mamahaha, as in the two previous SS games. Her \"Bust\" version, however, is accompanied by her pet wolf, Shikuru. (Like with Mamahaha, she is able to hop onto Shikuruu's back and perform modified attacks.) Galford in his \"Bust\" version fights without his dog, Poppy for the first time in the series.", "platform": "SNK Neo Geo CD", "release_date": "November 15, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "SNK", "publishers": "SNK", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86838-samurai-shodown-iii\n"}
