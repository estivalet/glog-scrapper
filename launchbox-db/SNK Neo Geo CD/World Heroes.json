It was originally released for the Neo Geo MVS arcade cabinet on July 28, 1992. It is ADK's first game in the fighting game genre, as well as their earliest attempt in the fighting game trend of the '90s that was popularized by Capcom's 1991 arcade-hit Street Fighter II. It was even the last game with the \"Alpha\" logo labeled within the game before the developer became \"ADK\"; however, the \"Alpha\" logo was last used on one of the arcade flyers of its sequel.", "platform": "SNK Neo Geo CD", "release_date": "July 28, 1992", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Alpha Denshi", "publishers": "Alpha Denshi", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.57", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heroes_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/93433-world-heroes\n"}
