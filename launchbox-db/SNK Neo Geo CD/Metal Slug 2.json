{"altername_name": [], "name": "Metal Slug 2", "overview": "Metal Slug 2 is a run and gun video game for the Neo-Geo console/arcade platform created by SNK. It was released in 1998 for the MVS arcade platform and is the sequel to the popular Metal Slug. It is the second title in the Metal Slug series. The game was later re-released in a slightly modified/remixed form as Metal Slug X. General Morden, the antagonist from the first game is back once more with his army, bent on taking over the world. It is up to the Peregrine Falcon squad, who are now joined by two new characters: Eri Kasamoto and Fio Germi of the Sparrows Intelligence Unit, to save the day. As the levels unfold, it turns out that Morden has allied with Martians to help facilitate his plans. In the final level of the game, the tables are turned when Morden comes under attack and is betrayed by his Martian allies and he is taken prisoner by them. An ad-hoc alliance is formed between the Peregrine Falcon squad and General Morden's army to combat the greater alien threat. After a long battle, they succeed in defeating the Martians' Mothership, driving them off the Earth. Metal Slug 2 added new weapons to the player's arsenal. A single shot from the Laser Gun is capable of killing a column of infantry, and sustained fire quickly destroyed vehicles. Fire Bomb found in the second level help to clear away mummies. Armor Piercing give the Metal Slug cannon shot that only fire straight when engaging enemy vehicles.", "platform": "SNK Neo Geo CD", "release_date": "June 25, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "SNK", "publishers": "SNK", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.3", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Slug_2", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/77412-metal-slug-2\n"}
