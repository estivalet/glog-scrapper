The heroes of the three first Tengai Maky\u014d games must participate in a tournament and find out who is the most skillful fighter in the magical land of Jipang (which is very similar to the medieval Japan). The characters include well-known Far East of Eden heroes such as Ziria, Manjimaru, Kabuki, Orochimaru, and others - a total of eight playable characters. During the fights, you can either punch, kick, or use special attacks, that require a precise usage of buttons and also deplete your magic gauge. There are random items (such as healing potions) thrown on the battle field while you are fighting, which you can pick up.", "platform": "SNK Neo Geo CD", "release_date": "December 2, 1995", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Red Company", "publishers": "Hudson Soft", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_East_of_Eden:_Kabuki_Klash", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/87366-far-east-of-eden-kabuki-klash\n"}
