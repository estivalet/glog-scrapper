{"altername_name": ["\u5009\u5eab\u756a", "Sokoban", "Soukoban"], "name": "Soko-Ban", "overview": "Soko-Ban is a classic puzzle game, the basis of numerous clones in the later years. It is set in a warehouse. On each level, the player must push crates (from square to square) to get them onto designated spots; once each crate is on a marked spot, the level is complete. Crates can only be pushed one at a time (so two crates next to each other cannot be pushed together), and cannot be pulled--so it's possible to get a crate stuck in a corner, where it cannot be retrieved! By the last levels, you must plan 40 steps in advance.", "platform": "Epoch Game Pocket Computer", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Thinking Rabbit", "publishers": "Epoch", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.71", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPtsHapT5U4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/93970-soko-ban\n"}
