{"altername_name": [], "name": "Championship Baseball", "overview": "Championship Baseball is one of the few TI games that requires the MBX Expansion System sold by TI and Milton Bradley. It uses voice recognition, the special MBX joysticks (which has three axis and multiple buttons), and the special MBX keypad peripheral to issue plays and instructions to your team. This is a two-player game. There is no one-player option against the computer. The player at bat uses the joystick to control batting and running, and the fielding player uses voice recognition and the keypad to control the pitcher and fielders. Pitches vary by speed (fast, medium, or slow) and type (fastball or curveball). When fielding, the player speaks the name of the fielder or pitcher to indicate which position should try to catch and throw the ball.", "platform": "Texas Instruments TI 99/4A", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Milton Bradley", "publishers": "Milton Bradley", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/369554-championship-baseball\n"}
