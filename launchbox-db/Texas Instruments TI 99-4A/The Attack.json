{"altername_name": ["Alien Attack"], "name": "The Attack", "overview": "Originally called \"Alien Attack,\" this game pits the player against alien \"spores.\" Although the spores themselves are harmless, they can join together to form giant aliens that chase you down and eat you. To make matters more interesting, scattered around the playing field are a number of \"incubators,\" which can hatch either more spores or, at later levels (or in early levels, in more advanced difficulty levels), more aliens. Use your ship's weapons to blast the spores before they can make new aliens, and blast any aliens before they can devour you.", "platform": "Texas Instruments TI 99/4A", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Milton Bradley", "publishers": "Texas Instruments", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Attack_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ym939nSHXo&t=123s", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/93807-the-attack\n"}
