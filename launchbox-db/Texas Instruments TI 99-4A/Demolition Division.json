{"altername_name": [], "name": "Demolition Division", "overview": "This arcade-style educational game pits you against a series of tanks that advance on your territory. Each tank has a division problem on its side. Use the right answers to arm your anti-tank guns and destroy the tanks before they can reach your bunkers. But be careful! Wrong answers will cause your shot to miss. And don't relax too soon, because as soon as you destroy one tank, another pulls up to replace it!", "platform": "Texas Instruments TI 99/4A", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Educational Information Systems", "publishers": "Texas Instruments", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/131993-demolition-division\n"}
