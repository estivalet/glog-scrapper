{"altername_name": ["Jawbreaker 2", "Jaw Breaker II"], "name": "Jawbreaker II", "overview": "In Jawbreaker II, the player controls a large set of teeth that munches everything in sight. The screen is a series of rows of Dots and moving passages. The player's goal is to eat all the Dots without being hit by one of the Grinning Gobblers. There are Energizers on each level, which give the player power to eat the Grinning Gobblers. Each consecutive Grinning Gobbler is worth increasing points when eaten after a single Energizer. A level is cleared when all the Dots and Energizers are eaten.", "platform": "Texas Instruments TI 99/4A", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sierra On-Line", "publishers": "Texas Instruments", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/369582-jawbreaker-ii\n"}
