{"altername_name": [], "name": "Blasto", "overview": "1 or 2 players each control a tank in this top-down game. The object is to clear as many mines and obstacles as you can before the timer runs out. But watch out! If you're too close to a mine when you shoot it, you'll blow up your own tank! And in a two-player game, you also have to be careful not to run into the other tank -- or get into its line of fire! The TI-99/4A port is slightly different in that unlike the original arcade version, this port has color graphics, whereas the original arcade was black and white monochrome.", "platform": "Texas Instruments TI 99/4A", "release_date": "October 1, 1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Milton Bradley", "publishers": "Texas Instruments", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.83", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blasto_(arcade_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/131985-blasto\n"}
