{"altername_name": [], "name": "007: Aqua Base", "overview": "007: Aqua Base is a text adventure and the first game in the TIventures series. As can be expected it is inspired by James Bond books and movies with the player taking the role of the secret agent. An evil computer operator is planning to blow up the world and the player's task is to find his hidden aqua base, backfire his lasers and then escape before everything blows up. It all has to be done within 90 minutes. The game works like any text adventure with the player entering compass directions to move around while simple two word verb noun commands such as \"take card\" are used to interact with the world. The game has a built-in hint system which is accessed by typing \"help\".", "platform": "Texas Instruments TI 99/4A", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Scott Morgan", "publishers": "American Software Design & Distribution", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/154368-007-aqua-base\n"}
