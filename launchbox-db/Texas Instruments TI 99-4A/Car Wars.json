{"altername_name": [], "name": "Car Wars", "overview": "In this combination racing game and maze game, you have to maneuver your race car around the track, clearing the dots from all five lanes. The catch is, there's another car (controlled by the computer) driving around the track, in the opposite direction, bent on stopping you. You have to be quick with the lane changes, or the computer car will crash into you. You start with three cars, and can gain extra cars by clearing all the dots from the track. But watch out! The computer adds an an additional opponent on the third round, and another every second round after that!", "platform": "Texas Instruments TI 99/4A", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Texas Instruments", "publishers": "Texas Instruments", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_Wars_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/131987-car-wars\n"}
