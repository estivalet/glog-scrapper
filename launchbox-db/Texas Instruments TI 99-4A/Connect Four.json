{"altername_name": [], "name": "Connect Four", "overview": "Just like physical forms of Connect Four, the object of the game, whether in one or two-player mode, is to get four checkers in a row either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The player(s) drops checkers at the top of a 7 column by 6 row playing area, trying to get the needed four-in-a-row either against a second player or the computer. Winning requires strategy both to be able to achieve a four-in-a-row, but also to ensure that the computer or human opponent doesn't get four-in-a-row first.", "platform": "Texas Instruments TI 99/4A", "release_date": "1979", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Milton Bradley", "publishers": "Milton Bradley", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/369571-connect-four\n"}
