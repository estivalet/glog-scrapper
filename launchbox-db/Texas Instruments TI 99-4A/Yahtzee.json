{"altername_name": [], "name": "Yahtzee", "overview": "Yahtzee for the TI-99 home computer system shares similarities with the regular dice-based game of Yahtzee with some unique differences. When the game begins, the option is presented to play either a one or two-player game. In one-player mode, the player plays against the computer. Two-player mode allows for two people to play against each other. A unique option that the TI-99 version offers at the beginning of either one or two-player modes is to play regular mode, where each player rolls their first roll as normal, or challenge mode, where each player starts off with the same 5 dice on the first roll. After each roll of the dice, the player selects which dice to keep, and rolls the remaining dice. Each player or the computer player takes up to three rolls of the dice and selects which space on the scorecard to place the points. At the end of each game, the player or computer player with the highest point total wins.", "platform": "Texas Instruments TI 99/4A", "release_date": "1979", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Milton Bradley", "publishers": "Milton Bradley", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/369608-yahtzee\n"}
