{"altername_name": [], "name": "Laser Shield", "overview": "Laser Shield is a Missile Command variant that is played with a completely different control method. Rather than using a crosshair to aim with, this game uses a coordinate based system using the keyboard. To fire the lasers the player enters the altitude (1 to 9) and the area (A to E) followed by pressing the fire button. There are four cities that need to be defended and between them is the laser base that also needs to survive the attack. The missiles will appear in three waves that get increasingly harder. Points are awarded based on how many cities survive each wave. The game ends when all cities or the laser base have been destroyed.", "platform": "Texas Instruments TI 99/4A", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "American Software Design & Distribution", "publishers": "American Software Design & Distribution", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/154469-laser-shield\n"}
