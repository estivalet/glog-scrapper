{"altername_name": ["Protector", "Protector 2"], "name": "Protector II", "overview": "The player in Protector II pilots a spacecraft called the Neeedlefighter ship. The goal is to rescue the 18 stranded survivors from the surface of the planet. This rescue occurs in stages with no apparent transition between stages. First, the player moves the player from their original location to the top of the buildings in the City of Hope. From there, he/she must continue to move them to a portal that is blockaded deep in the Verdann Fortress. The player starts 6 Needlefighters and loses one for each hit with an enemy spacecraft or bullet. The transport of the survivors occurs one at-a-time. The cartridge for Protector II is actually mislabeled as Protector (without the roman numeral \"II\" designation).", "platform": "Texas Instruments TI 99/4A", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mike Yantis", "publishers": "Atarisoft", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/369607-protector-ii\n"}
