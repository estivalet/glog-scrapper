{"altername_name": [], "name": "Alligator Mix", "overview": "In Alligator Mix, a series of apples, with mathematic expressions written on them, travels towards the player, represented by an alligator that has a potential answer displayed on its side. If the answer on the alligator is correct, the player presses the Space Bar to open the mouth. If the answer is incorrect, the player keeps the alligator's mouth closed. As the player correctly answers questions, new alligators are created above the current alligator. There are five levels of alligators. Each one is higher up, and further left, giving the player less time to decide if the answer is correct or not. This makes the game more difficult as the game proceeds.", "platform": "Texas Instruments TI 99/4A", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Educational Information Systems", "publishers": "DLM (Developmental Learning Materials)", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/369546-alligator-mix\n"}
