{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ant Colony", "overview": "The player in Ant Colony is represented by an exterminator who travels through tunnels in an ant colony spraying ants that get too close before they get to him. Openings, where ants can escape from, will show a countdown to help the player know when new ants are about to emerge. The object of the game is to seal all the ant holes to prevent more ants from escaping. Black ants can be killed with 1 spray, red ants require 2 sprays. The player starts each round with 20 sprays to close up ant holes and kill ants.", "platform": "Texas Instruments TI 99/4A", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kent Stevenson", "publishers": "Funware", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://4apedia.com/index.php/Ant_Colony", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yywP5-lpK84", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/370772-ant-colony\n"}
