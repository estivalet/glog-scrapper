{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tunnels of Doom", "overview": "One of the first graphical computer role-playing games, Tunnels of Doom puts the players in control of up to four characters in a single party, to explore the dangerous Tunnels of Doom, fight monsters, and collect treasure. The four characters can be controlled by one player as a party, or by up to four players, each choosing an action during battles. There are four different character classes available: Fighter, Rogue, Wizard, and Hero. The latter can be selected only if he is the only character in the party. Enemies appear randomly, and the battles are turn-based. Various treasure is scattered around the dungeon; the player also has the option of buying certain equipment. In some places, fountains can be found; drinking from them will affect the party in different ways, positive or negative.", "platform": "Texas Instruments TI 99/4A", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Texas Instruments", "publishers": "Texas Instruments", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.83", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnels_of_Doom", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/132015-tunnels-of-doom\n"}
