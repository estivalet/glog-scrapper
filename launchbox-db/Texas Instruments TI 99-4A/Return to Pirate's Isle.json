{"altername_name": [], "name": "Return to Pirate's Isle", "overview": "Created exclusively for the TI, Return to Pirate's Isle was the only Scott Adams adventure which did NOT require the TI Adventure cartridge, available separately. It is still subject to debate whether this is truly #14 in the series or whether it does not count since it was only made for the TI. It uses the same parser and interface as the other games in the series, and challenges you to return to Pirate's Isle in search of treasure yet again.", "platform": "Texas Instruments TI 99/4A", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Adventure International", "publishers": "Texas Instruments", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.62", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFrI1KcBJ-8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40915-return-to-pirates-isle\n"}
