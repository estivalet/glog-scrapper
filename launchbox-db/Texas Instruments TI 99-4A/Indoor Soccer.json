{"altername_name": [], "name": "Indoor Soccer", "overview": "Indoor soccer is a standard five-on-five soccer game on the computer. It is a two-player game only as there is no one-player vs. the computer option. With it being an indoor arena that the players play in, there is no out-of-bounds or throwing in which makes the gameplay much faster and easier. Players also don't have to concern themselves with offsides as it's not possible to do during gameplay.", "platform": "Texas Instruments TI 99/4A", "release_date": "1980", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Texas Instruments", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/369581-indoor-soccer\n"}
