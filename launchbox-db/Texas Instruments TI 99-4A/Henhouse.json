{"altername_name": [], "name": "Henhouse", "overview": "In Henhouse, you are trying to help a farmer collect his eggs. Eggs are laid in the hen house near the top of the screen, and then move to one of five chutes. When the chute is full, you can collect the eggs and take them to your truck. If the chute is full and another egg lands in it, you'll have a cracked egg. Six cracked eggs will end your game. Of course, you're not the only one who wants those eggs. Bandits and coyotes appear from time to time. Bandits will steal an egg (earning you a cracked egg), but the coyotes will kill your chickens, ending the game. To stop them, you have to grab your shotgun from the left of the screen and shoot them. There are also two birds flying at the top of the screen. Although they don't harm you, you can shoot them for 50 points. You must put your gun back when finished defending the hen house, as you cannot collect eggs while holding the gun.", "platform": "Texas Instruments TI 99/4A", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Funware", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henhouse_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/169264-henhouse\n"}
