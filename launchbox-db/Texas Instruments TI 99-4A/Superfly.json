{"altername_name": [], "name": "Superfly", "overview": "Superfly pits you, a housefly, against all the baddies of the fly world. These spiders don't know what they are messing with as you are no ordinary fly, but Superfly! The object of the game is to advance through various levels blasting away at all the creatures on the screen before they can devour you. As Superfly, you have the option to use two different ranges of firepower, either a short or a long-range shot. Spiders have to hatch from their eggs and evolve before being able to attack you.", "platform": "Texas Instruments TI 99/4A", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Milton Bradley", "publishers": "Milton Bradley", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/369612-superfly\n"}
