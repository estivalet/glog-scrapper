{"altername_name": [], "name": "Parsec", "overview": "Parsec is a side-scrolling space shooter. Waves of alien craft swoop down from the top and the player must shoot them down without colliding with them or the ground, running out of fuel, or overheating the ship's laser. Some enemies are harder to destroy and shoot back. At the end of each level, the player must navigate through an asteroid field which can yield many points, but can also result in a loss of ships in the process due to collisions. The game takes advantage of the TI's speech synthesizer: a female voice occasionally makes comments such as \"Nice shooting, pilot!\", or \"Asteroid field ahead\" throughout the course of the game.", "platform": "Texas Instruments TI 99/4A", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Texas Instruments", "publishers": "Texas Instruments", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.56", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZgFAgmJkiE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/48437-parsec\n"}
