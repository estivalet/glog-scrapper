{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hunt the Wumpus", "overview": "A mythical creature called a Wumpus is sleeping somewhere in a series of maze-like caves, and your goal is to hunt it down. The cave is dangerous, and in addition to the Wumpus there are bottomless pits and cave bats. Walking into a pit ends the game, encountering a bat will cause you to be relocated to a random location in the cave (which may or may not be safe), and walking into the same room as the Wumpus will cause it to wake up and eat you. To help figure out where these dangers are various cave rooms can provide clues. For example, finding blood splattered in the room means the Wumpus is near, or if you feel a breeze then a pit is near. From these clues you need to deduce the layout of the cave and the location of the Wumpus. If you think you know where the Wumpus is, you have one arrow to fire; a hit wins the game, but a miss means you are eaten by the Wumpus.", "platform": "Texas Instruments TI 99/4A", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Texas Instruments", "publishers": "Texas Instruments", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.3", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunt_the_Wumpus", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGVOw8gXl6Y", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/93816-hunt-the-wumpus\n"}
