{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hopper", "overview": "In Hopper, the player controls a kangaroo trying to escape capture from three humans on a cargo ship. The player moves around the ship full of boxes, trying to kill or trap the human enemies by pushing boxes at them and smashing them. If the humans touch the player's kangaroo character, he/she is captured and loses a life. While not too difficult in the early levels, Hopper becomes much more challenging as the levels and the speed increase.", "platform": "Texas Instruments TI 99/4A", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "John M.
