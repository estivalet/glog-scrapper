{"altername_name": [], "name": "Astromania", "overview": "Astromania is an action game that consists of three different sections that have to be played in order. On the first stage the player will find his space ship stationed in the middle of the screen surrounded by four cannons that launch asteroids towards the player. With the use of four directional keys the player has to shoot down the asteroids before being hit. The second stage is more like a traditional fixed screen shoot 'em up although the player's ship cannot move. Aliens appear in groups of three and move across the screen and the player has to shoot them down before they reach the bottom. Finally the player has to navigate his ship through a meteor belt. The ship automatically moves upwards and the player has to steer it left and right to avoid the meteors. Upon reaching the top of the screen a droid will appear to the left or right of the ship. The player has to quickly aim and shoot the droid before it destroys the ship. If the player has any lives left after the third stage he will return to the first stage but will play it on a higher difficulty. The player starts the game with ten lives.", "platform": "Texas Instruments TI 99/4A", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Joe Macchiarulo", "publishers": "Moonbeam Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/156351-astromania\n"}
