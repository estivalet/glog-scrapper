{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dragon Mix", "overview": "The player in Dragon Mix is represented by a dragon which stands underneath a city with three skyscrapers on the right-hand side of the screen. Three alien ships advance on the player, each displaying either a multiplication or division problem. The dragon's tongue continuously moves up and down at a set speed. The dragon displays an answer to one of the three mathematical problems. The player's object is to wait until the dragon's tongue is pointed toward the spaceship that has the multiplication or division problem that the answer on the dragon's belly satisfies. The player then fires a laser by using either the Fire button on the joystick or by pressing either the Q, Y, or Space Bar on the computer keyboard. If the player aligns the correct answer to the correct problem, the enemy ship is destroyed. If the player is incorrect, the alien ship advances one extra space forward. If an alien ship reaches the mid-point of the screen, then one of the three skyscrapers is destroyed, and the screen resets with three new alien ships. The player, then, using his/her dragon, is to correctly destroy each alien ship during the allotted time, and make as few mistakes as possible.", "platform": "Texas Instruments TI 99/4A", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Educational Information Systems", "publishers": "DLM", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/369560-dragon-mix\n"}
