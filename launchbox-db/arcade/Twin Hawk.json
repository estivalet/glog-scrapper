{"name": "Twin Hawk", "overview": "Twin Hawk resembles other shooters of the time, specifically Toaplan's earlier game, Flying Shark. Also like Toaplan's other games, there were various differences between the Japanese version and other versions, including a checkpoint system and higher difficulty for the former. Unusually, the game contains no flying enemies; thus, a complete lack of physical obstructions and a stronger focus on the numbers and speed of ground forces.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "January 1, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "ToaPlan", "publishers": "Taito", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.59", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJHRwKqVS_c", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/32458"}
