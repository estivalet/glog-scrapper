{"name": "Final Lap", "overview": "Final Lap by Namco is considered by many to be the spiritual successor to Pole Position. This fairly straightforward Formula 1 racing game features a single track like the first Pole Position, this time a replica of the Suzuka Circuit which had just been added to Formula 1. Final Lap's claim to fame was the ability to link up to eight cabinets together for a massive race, unheard of at the time and commonplace on many racing games made afterward.<br><br>The NES version has different features and mechanics, and could be considered a separate game in its own right. There is a one or two player mode which is raced via split-screen, and up to eight players can take turns playing in a tournament mode. The initial race takes place on an oval track in New York while subsequent tracks with more challenging turns and corners will take players all over the world; from Mexico to Monaco. Each car can be upgraded before a race with allotted points to customize the tires, engine, brakes, and nitro. Nitro is kicked in by pressing up on the control pad. Colliding into competitors will bump your car back but sliding into billboards on the side can cause your vehicle to spin out", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Namco", "publishers": "Atari Games", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.09", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpWlnJtio3Y", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/36203"}
