{"name": "Yie Ar Kung-Fu", "overview": "Yie Ar Kung-Fu (Chinese: \u4e00\u4e8c\u529f\u592b; pinyin: y\u012b \u00e8r g\u014dng f\u016b; literally \"One Two Kung Fu\"; \"Yie Ar\" is pronounced \"ee-ar\") features the hero, Oolong (written \u70cf\u9f8d W\u016bl\u00f3ng, and \u30a6\u30fc\u30ed\u30f3 \u016aron in Japanese), controlled by the player. Oolong must fight all the martial arts masters given by the game (11 in the arcade version; five to 13 in the home ports) unarmed to win the title of \"Grand Master\" and honor the memory of his father. On his side is a variety of punch and kick blows reachable by combining the joystick with one of the buttons (punch or kick). He also has the greatest jumping ability of all the game's fighters, with the exception of \"Blues\".<br>The player faces a variety of opponents, each with a unique appearance and fighting style. The player can perform up to 16 different moves, using a combination of buttons and joystick movements while standing, crouching or jumping. Moves are thrown at high, middle, and low levels. Regardless of the move that defeated them, male characters (save Feedle) always fall unconscious lying on their backs with their legs apart (players flail their feet), and female characters always fall demurely lying on their sides. Feedle disappears. There are only two female fighters, and the rest are male. When a player gains an extra life, the word \"xi\u00e8 xi\u00e8\" (Mandarin Chinese for \"thank you\") is heard.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "January 1, 1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.62", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zh9mPILeuOk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/14102"}
