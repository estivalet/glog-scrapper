{"name": "Street Fighter III: New Generation", "overview": "A one-on-one fighting game. There are eight characters to choose from including twins with the same abilities and a very annoying boss. The game has smoother animation than in any other previous game in this series.<br><br>The long awaited sequel to Street Fighter II: The World Warrior, this game features the not-so-unexpected return of Ryu and Ken plus a new generation of street fighters.<br><br>Air-blocking and taunts from the Alpha series have been replaced by parrying. To parry a hit, you increase your super meter, but not the attacker's. This technique, called \"offensive blocking\" is performed by hitting towards your opponent just before you get hit.<br><br>The only returning characters are Ken and Ryu, the rest are new. However, some of the new characters are related to the old ones. Sean is Ken's pupil, Yang and Yun are Gen's grandsons and Ibuki is rumored to be the daughter of Geki (a ninja from the original Street Fighter). Some characters have fighting styles similar to some of the older characters.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "February 4, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Capcom", "publishers": "Capcom", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.08", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2t6ZX5-kQg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/12251"}
