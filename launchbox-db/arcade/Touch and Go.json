{"name": "Touch and Go", "overview": "Touch and Go was produced by Gaelco in 1995.<br><br>Touch and Go is a 2D beach volleyball game played from a side view. The game uses a standing cabinet with room for two players. As matches are played two-on-two, in multiplayer two players can choose to form a single team or to play against each other each with a computer-controlled team mate. Optionally two cabinets can be linked for four-player multiplayer powered by a single PCB.<br><br>There are eight teams each representing a different nation. A character is controlled using a joystick and a single button for all actions. A marker shows where the ball will go and when the character is moved in that position the button is used to do a reception, give a pass, jump, block or smash. A dive is also possible when just out of reach. Serving is done in a separate superimposed window with different options for the direction of the serve, the power, low or high, and standing or running. While jumping pushing the joystick forward will make the character perform a spike, while moving it backward is used to fake and dig.<br><br>While regular rules are followed for scoring, not an entire set is played. The match starts at 11-11 and the first team to reach fifteen points with a two-point difference, wins. When teams are tied the match continues until there is a two-point difference. The game continues with matches until every team has been defeated.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gaelco", "publishers": "Gaelco", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.06", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93_dvjme-8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/39741"}
