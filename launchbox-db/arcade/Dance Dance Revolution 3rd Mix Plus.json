{"name": "Dance Dance Revolution 3rd Mix Plus", "overview": "Dance Dance Revolution 3rd Mix Plus is a re-issue of DDR 3rd Mix. It does away with SSR (Step Step Revolution) mode and adds 23 songs: 14 brand-new songs, the 7 new songs added to 3rd Mix Korean version, and 2 more carryovers from DDR 2nd Mix.<br><br>The core gameplay of DDR 3rdMIX is the same as the previous Dance Dance Revolution games. 3rd Mix featured a brand-new scoring system, instead of being heavily combo-based like the last two mixes, combos are of virtually no importance. The maximum score for each song is 10,000,000 (all Perfects).<br><br>3rd Mix was also the first version of DDR where different beats (compared to a 4-beat register) alternate different colors, making 1/4th, 1/6th, 1/8th, 1/12th and 1/16th steps look different and making it easier for the player to recognize changing rhythms. This color scheme is called \"vivid\" mode, whereby the old scheme of all arrows being the same color is henceforth referred to as \"flat\" mode. Flat appears as an option and modifier in later versions of DDR.<br><br>This release marked the first time lyrics were displayed during gameplay for every song. This can be turned on or off by the arcade operator. This feature was later dropped.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Music", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/35775"}
