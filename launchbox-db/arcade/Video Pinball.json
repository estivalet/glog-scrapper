{"name": "Video Pinball", "overview": "World's first video attraction to simulate a pinball game. Video Pinball was an instant winner. With fluorescent 'disco' 3-D play-field, challenging targets, bumpers, slingshots, rollovers and drop targets Atari Video Pinball had it all, but without all the mechanical objects associated with classic pinball games. Even a pinball 'nudge' feature is included to give a more realistic feel to the play action. Approximately 1,500 units were produced.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "February 1, 1979", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atari", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.29", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/39965"}
