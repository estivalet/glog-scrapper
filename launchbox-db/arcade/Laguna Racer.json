{"name": "Laguna Racer", "overview": "Laguna Racer is a racing arcade game, which was released by Midway Games in 1977; it utilizes an Intel 8080 microprocessor (running at 1.9968 MHz), and the player must use a steering wheel to take up control of a car (with a single pedal to make it accelerate and a gear shifter to switch between low and high gear). Your score is measured in \"miles\", and as with many other early Midway games, the gameplay is time-based as opposed to life-based - and it'll get extended, if you manage to score a certain amount of points before the timer has run out. You also have to watch out for CPU-controlled cars upon the track; if you crash into one, your speed (indicated at the bottom of the screen, like in Midnite Racer) will be reduced to 0 mph, and you'll have to shift the car back into low gear to regain your lost speed before shifting into high gear again.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "September 1, 1977", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Midway", "publishers": "", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.7", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/37131"}
