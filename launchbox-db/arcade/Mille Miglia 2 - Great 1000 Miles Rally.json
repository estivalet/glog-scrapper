{"name": "Mille Miglia 2: Great 1000 Miles Rally", "overview": "Mille Miglia 2: Great 1000 Miles Rally was produced by Kaneko in 1995.<br><br>A driving game with top-down pseudo 3-D graphics. You can select one of ten cars and depending upon which vehicle has been chosen, you can select the starting point of the race. The game can be installed in a variety of cabinets using either a joystick and buttons or a steering wheel and foot pedals for control. This is a follow on to the original Rally series.<br><br>You have 60 seconds to get from the starting line to the finish line. Finishing within 60 seconds allows you to go on to the next race. If you lose, a continue option is available.<br>The screen scrolls fast. The only way you know about a turn coming up is by a little indicator that flashes with a picture of the turn. There are zig-zags, hairpins and all other cool turns, most of which you have to steer into in order to make it though. The play control using a joystick is a little awkward at first, but it becomes comfortable after a while.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kaneko", "publishers": "Kaneko", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.04", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bnt7oa8TLgs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/31640"}
