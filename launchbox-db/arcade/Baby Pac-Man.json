{"name": "Baby Pac-Man", "overview": "Baby Pac-Man is a hybrid arcade/pinball game released by Bally Midway on October 11, 1982. The cabinet consists of a 13-inch video screen seated above an elevated horizontal pinball game, and the combination fits into roughly the same size space as an upright arcade machine.<br><br>The development of Baby Pac-Man was not authorized by Namco. It was designed and released entirely by Bally-Midway (as were Pac-Man Plus, Jr. Pac-Man, and Professor Pac-Man), which eventually led to Namco canceling its relationship with Bally-Midway. 7,000 units were produced.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bally Midway", "publishers": "Bally Midway", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.68", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/30091"}
