{"name": "Guided Missile", "overview": "Guided Missile, also known as Missile-X, is a fixed shooter arcade game that had been released by Midway Games in 1977 and licensed to Taito Corporation for Japanese manufacture and distribution; it utilizes an Intel 8080 microprocessor (running at 1.9968 MHz), and the players must use a button to launch missiles at various targets that are moving across the screen. Once a missile has reached the top of the screen, it will start descending - and you will have to push the 2-way joystick left (and right) to aim it towards the targets. As with many other early Midway games the gameplay is time-based as opposed to life-based; and it will also get extended if you manage to score a certain amount of points before the timer runs out. The Taito Corporation version of this title also has a different score display.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "April 1, 1977", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Midway", "publishers": "", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/36582"}
