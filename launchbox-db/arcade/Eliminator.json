{"name": "Eliminator", "overview": "A top-down space shooter set within a bounded playfield, where the player maneuvers a ship using rotation, thrust and forward-firing controls (much like Asteroids or Space War). Each stage is populated by autmated drone ships (or by competing players), and dominated by the titular enemy: a moving, rotating space fortress surrounded by a lethal force field.<br><br>This circular force field instantly destroys anything that smacks against it. Shots fired by the player (and the drones) are non-lethal: the target is simply kicked back across the playfield, bouncing off the walls. The exception is the enemy ship hidden inside the Eliminator - it can (and must) be destroyed by sneaking a shot through the structure's narrow opening. If this isn't done quickly enough, it will emerge and start pursuing the player with deadly fireballs.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.05", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV7Vy4LrRfM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/14446"}
