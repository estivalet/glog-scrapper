{"name": "Brain", "overview": "This is a side-scrolling shoot-'em-up, in the style of Gradius. You play as a helicopter gunship, and when you enter a building as a spaceman(who can shoot in eight directions).<br><br>Interestingly, you can manually scroll up and down as the game scrolls right, but cannot scroll backwards. Destroyed enemies leave power-ups (improving your firepower), smart-bombs which trigger on collecting them, and floppy disks which you must collect to win the game.<br><br>Another factor is your oxygen level, which shows as an air meter at the bottom (you can gain more air through each stage). There are end-of-level bosses.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Coreland", "publishers": "Sega Enterprises Ltd.", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.64", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDAI8ax954I", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/28848"}
