{"name": "Time Crisis", "overview": "The game is a first person rail shooter that is played with a light gun and a foot pedal. The foot pedal is used to move out from behind cover to begin shooting. While the pedal is released the player is moved behind cover so that he can reload without being hit. The light gun that this arcade game used had a blowback function where the top of the gun would slide back to simulate a real gun. The game is moved along by a constantly decreasing timer that is only increased by completing a stage.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "December 1, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Namco", "publishers": "Sony", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.39", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovC418vaJ60", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/33313"}
