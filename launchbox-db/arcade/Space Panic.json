{"name": "Space Panic", "overview": "Space Panic was produced by Universal in 1980.<br><br>You control an astronaut who ventures through caverns beneath a planet. Climb ladders and move from floor to floor avoiding alien creatures. Trap the aliens by digging holes for them to fall into and then hit them over the head to eliminate them.<br><br>A game remarkably similar to Lode Runner, you play an astronaut with limited oxygen (time) chased around by various space aliens. Your only method of dealing with these multicolored threats from space is to dig a hole, lure it into a hole and then manually fill up the hole with the alien in it. Dropping aliens on top of other aliens earns you extra points and eliminates both. Levels get progressively harder and enemies grow faster.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1980", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Universal", "publishers": "ADP Automaten", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLd1xABCsaQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/39025"}
