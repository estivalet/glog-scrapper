{"name": "Demolition Derby (Chicago Coin)", "overview": "A black and white driving game where each player controls a pursuit car that tries to demolish drone cars to score points.<br><br>Challenging and fast-moving super skill play, and never plays the same twice! Two target drones are always on the screen, darting around in competive evasive action as though they are controlled independantly. When a player has his or her car hit a drone, the drone is demolished and a point is scored. Drone wreckage remains on the screen and another comes into action. As drones pile up, each player must maneuver with increased speed and skill to increase his or her score before time is up.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "January 1, 1976", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Chicago Coin", "publishers": "Chicago Coin", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.93", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/35872"}
