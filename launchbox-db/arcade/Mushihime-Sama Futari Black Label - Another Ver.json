{"name": "Mushihime-Sama Futari Black Label: Another Ver", "overview": "Cave would go on to release a modified version of Mushihime-Sama Futari Black Label two years later. Aimed exclusively at an international release, the aptly titled Mushihime-sama Futari Black Label \"Another Ver\" featured bosses with reduced health from the original Black Label release. Due to its extremely limited production numbers and how quickly it sold out, many people would normally never get the chance to play this version of the game.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "November 27, 2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Cave", "publishers": "AMI", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.64", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/KW9-RxRYBKU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/37774"}
