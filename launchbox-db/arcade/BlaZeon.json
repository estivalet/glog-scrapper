{"name": "BlaZeon", "overview": "In this side-scrolling shooter, you can transform your ship into most of the enemy ships you encounter by destroying them with a secondary weapon, then touching the hologram left behind. The forms you can take on have their own primary and secondary weapons, and some can take multiple hits before being destroyed. If your transformed ship is destroyed, you return to normal without losing a life. This game was ported to the Super Famicom console.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "A.I.", "publishers": "Atlus", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.43", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3gw4DI_X9s", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/33828"}
