There are secret items and food to be found on each level that increases the player's power and score. For extra bonus stages, complete a level without eating any of the power dots.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Semicom", "publishers": "Semicom", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.03", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq0vLWnQpVs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/33238"}
