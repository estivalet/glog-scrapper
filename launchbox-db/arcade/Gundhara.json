{"name": "Gundhara", "overview": "Gundhara is a 2D top-down shooter, similar to Commando, Ikari Warriors or Bloody Wolf. The game has two heroes: Jerry and Jinn. Gameplay is simple and dynamic - the chosen hero shoots various enemies (like soldiers and robots) in the jungle and other location, and rescues hostages. A big boss awaits at end of each level.
