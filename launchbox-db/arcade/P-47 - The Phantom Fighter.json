{"name": "P-47: The Phantom Fighter", "overview": "P-47 is a two-dimensional, scrolling shooter type of game. You play as the pilot of a P-47. Your mission is to basically destroy as many of the enemies as you possibly can. This means eliminating as many air and ground units as you can. You will be going through four missions (each being broken up into two parts) and at the end of each of these parts is an enemy boss for you to tangle with. Although you have unlimited ammunition, the enemy will make you pay for the invasion into their homeland. You will be able to accomplish this with various power-ups and also a second player (if they buy in). Your mission won't be easy but it is necessary so you can secure both the skies and ground for our troops.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jaleco Ltd.", "publishers": "Jaleco Ltd.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.43", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBjkswNGOh8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2318"}
