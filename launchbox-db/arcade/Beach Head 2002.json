{"name": "Beach Head 2002", "overview": "A virtual reality military combat game released on the Global VR Vortek system.<br><br>Beach Head 2002 puts players in the position of a lone soldier, charged with defending a vital inland command post against an imminent airborne assault. With the beach invasion repulsed, players are sent to the rear. The enemy is determined to launch an all-out airborne assault in the rear. Paratroopers, infantry, tanks, armored cars, helicopters and gun-ships converge onto the battlefield. Adding to the madness is the re-introduction of the player's former drill sergeant, whose exclusive assignment is to 'inspire' and 'motivate' players.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "2002", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/35100"}
