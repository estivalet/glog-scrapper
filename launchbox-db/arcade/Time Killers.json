{"name": "Time Killers", "overview": "Time Killers is a one-on-one versus beat-em-up with gameplay in a similar vein as Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter 2. <br><br>What is primarily different is that you can attack with all body parts - the head, both arms and both legs. A damage system allows arms to be hacked off, but fighters can keep going with only legs and the head. A special feature allows the characters to perform a decapitation manoeuver called a 'death move' (similar to Barbarian), at any time during a round, instantly killing an opponent, and subsequently ending the round. The game features cartoon-like over-the-top blood and gore violence.<br><br>There are eight selectable characters, and each one has unique weapons and attributes pertaining to the period in time they are from, e.g. Thugg is a caveman with a stone axe from 20,000 BC, Musashi is a samurai from Feudal Japan 1496, Orion is an intergalactic bounty hunter with an electro-sword from 2885 etc.<br><br>In the single player game, if you manage to defeat all standard opponents, you can face off against Death himself.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Incredible Technologies", "publishers": "Strata", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.41", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxNrHM0OB14", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/39671"}
