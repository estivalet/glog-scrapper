{"name": "EVR Race", "overview": "EVR Race was a video-base race arcade system released by Nintendo in 1975, in two versions: horse racing and car racing. EVR Race gets its name from the electronic video recording system it uses to display the two versions of the game. Players bet on which horse or car they believe will win the race, and the game will display a random prerecorded video. Players gain rewards based on how well their bets did and the odds displayed before the race.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1975", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nintendo", "publishers": "The Nintendo Company", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_XF1zWLGCQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/160053"}
