However, players can now only match one tile from the formation with one tile visible on the screen in the player's \"Liong\" (a long-winding figure resembling a Chinese dragon, based on the real-life \"dragon dance\"). Similar to the Puzz Loop, Luxor, and Zuma series, the Liong moves along a set path and causes the player to lose once it reaches its goal.<br><br>It was later ported (under the title Dragon Dance) by Success for arcades (using PC-based Skonec SkoPro hardware) in Japan on late 2008, and for both the Nintendo DS and PlayStation Portable in Japan on February 26, 2009.
