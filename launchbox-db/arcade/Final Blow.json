{"name": "Final Blow", "overview": "Final Blow is a boxing arcade game created in 1988 by Taito. The name would remain the same for all ported platforms, except for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis versions, which Sega released outside of Japan as James 'Buster' Douglas Knockout Boxing featuring Buster Douglas himself in 1990 immediately after his victory over Mike Tyson.<br><br>The game is essentially a side scrolling boxing game where the player moves left and right to control a screen sized boxer. When the timing is right, the player can unleash a final blow punch which can sometimes KO the opponent in a single strike. The home versions contained a spectator mode where the player can watch their favorite boxers compete.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Taito", "publishers": "Taito", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.89", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Bp3Jc4SG8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/23546"}
