Like in the first game, the action takes place in alternate Japan (science fantasy + Sengoku period), and Oda Nobunaga is the main enemy. The player can select one from four characters: Takeda Nobukatsu, Momochi Sandayu, Seiryubo and Akechi Mitsuhide (there's also one hidden character, Saika Magoichi). <br><br>Game's danmaku style is simple - fly forward, shoot enemies, collect points and weapon's upgrade, dodge myriad bullets and defeat giant bosses. Vasara 2 has one unique feature, direct contact with the enemy is not deadly - the player is only slightly repelled.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Visco Games", "publishers": "Visco Games", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/OdhjxampzLU?t=453", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/39945"}
