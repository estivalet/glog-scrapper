{"name": "World Rally 2: Twin Racing", "overview": "World Rally 2: Twin Racing is the sequel to World Rally Championship with gameplay largely similar to the original game. Twin Racing in the title refers to a new gameplay element as the cabinet now has a setup with two units side by side, each with their own screen, seat, steering wheel and pedals. Only a single PCB is used to provide for both units. The first game was a standing single-player cabinet only with a steering wheel and buttons. Two players can challenge each other directly for a competition on the same track and the other player is shown as a ghost that cannot be harmed. Players can also choose to race side by side, but each their own single-player game. Both players can continue playing without spending an extra credit as long as they both finish under 60 seconds.<br><br>There are three cars to choose from and four Rallyes with multiple stages for each one. The rallyes are Portugal (Easy), Rallye Safari (Normal), Tour de Corse (France - Expert) and RAC Rallye (UK - Expert). The gameplay is very fast with large drifts through corners. There are different surfaces (tarmac, sand, snow) and some stages are done at night with headlights. Arrows warn of curves ahead as well as obstacles. Cars cannot sustain damage but heavy crashes slow down the car significantly, especially when they are turned over. Each stage needs to be completed in 60 seconds or less to progress, but some extended time is provided to finish the stage.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gaelco", "publishers": "Gaelco", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.36", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/s4kONGM8rpA?t=214", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40210"}
