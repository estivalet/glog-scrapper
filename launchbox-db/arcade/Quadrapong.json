{"name": "Quadrapong", "overview": "Elimination!, better known by its Atari name Quadrapong, is the third official Pong game. Like Pong Doubles, up to 4 players can participate. The court is a square with an opening in each wall. A ball ricochets around the square, and each player must manipulate their paddle to protect their opening. Each player has a set number of misses, and after the ball passes through a player's opening four times, that player's opening closes and their paddle disappears, therefore they are \"eliminated.\" The last player to have an open wall wins.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "March 4, 1974", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atari", "publishers": "Atari", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kIzedMXvvI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/30423"}
