{"name": "Rally Bike", "overview": "Rally Bike is a bird's eye viewed motorcycle road racing game, where the player controls a motorcycle and must cross the finish line before an established number of competitor bikes. Fuel is a major obstacle, as running out of it results in game over. Any accident will cause great reduction of fuel, and stopping to refuel will cause competitor bikes to take advantage. Competitors never run out of fuel.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "August 1, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Taito", "publishers": "Taito", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.08", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvhDLk0Hm-8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27109"}
