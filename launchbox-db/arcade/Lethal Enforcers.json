{"name": "Lethal Enforcers", "overview": "Set in Chicago, Illinois, United States, the player takes control of a police officer named Don Marshall, who has one day decided to go to the donut shop for a break. While sipping the last drop of coffee, he gets a call from the police department. They said that a major crime organisation has invaded town, and they need his help. He is one of the two survivors of the elite group of officers. The rest have ended up in the hospital or killed. Once the call ended, he decided to check out the bank. From that point on, he is going to experience the toughest job that he would had during his years in the police force. He has been assigned and agrees to help stop a growing crime wave that puts the city's security in serious jeopardy, along with a helper (a second player can join in).", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "January 1, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09l5HlMmrZ0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/15752"}
