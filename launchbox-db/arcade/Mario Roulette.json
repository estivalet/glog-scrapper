{"name": "Mario Roulette", "overview": "Mario Roulette is an arcade game developed by Konami in 1991. It uses graphics from the 1990 SNES game Super Mario World. The gameplay is a basic roulette game, and upon winning, the game dispenses medals which the player can exchange for prizes at the arcade.[1] Items that would be included in the game are the Super Mushroom, Fire Flower, Cape Feather, and Starman. As well as Mario and Yoshi, Peach and Bowser also make an appearance. If the player would get Peach/Bowser as the center icon, it would determine if the player wins/loses the round (Peach = wins, Bowser = losses).", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Casino", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrRSm-xpn6A", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/126829"}
