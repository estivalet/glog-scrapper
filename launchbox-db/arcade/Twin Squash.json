{"name": "Twin Squash", "overview": "Twin Squash (\u30c4\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30ab\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5) is an action game by Sega released exclusively on System C2 hardware in 1991.<br>The game is a competitive Breakout clone. Clearing four or more blocks will cause your blocks to rise and the competitor's to fall depending on how many blocks were cleared (look at a meter on the top of the screen). If blocks fall to the bottom of a player's side, that player loses. Losing the ball will only cause your blocks to go lower, as there is only one \"life.\"", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/39862"}
