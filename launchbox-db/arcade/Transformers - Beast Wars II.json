{"name": "Transformers: Beast Wars II", "overview": "Transformers: Beast Wars II, possibly also titled Greatest Showdown in History (\u53f2\u4e0a\u6700\u5927\u306e\u5bfe\u6c7a Shij\u014d Saidai no Taiketsu), is an arcade game developed by Sigma Enterprises, and published in 1998 by Takara for Japanese markets. It is a quick draw one-on-one fighter, pitting Lio Convoy against Galvatron. The game is essentially a simplistic gambling game. Coins fed into the machine add to a pot on Galvatron's side. The player must then wager three of these to activate combat. The two transform to robot mode and face off, with the player, controlling Lio Convoy, having to quickly press one of three attack button when prompted. Depending on the speed of input and choice of attack, damage will be dealt to either or both of the characters. A second round (set on the moon!) acts as a decider. Depending on their performance, the player's stake will increase (or be lost) and can be cashed out from Galvatron's pot.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sigma Enterprises", "publishers": "Takara", "genres": "Casino", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.72", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Urgp-fopGXE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/39779"}
