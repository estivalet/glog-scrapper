{"name": "Streets of Rage", "overview": "Axel, Adam and Blaze - ex-cops, the solution to punk pollution. The city's a war zone, and they're going out two at a time to give the gangs a kick in the guts. This is the ultimate in street combat. These city fighters are martial arts maniacs with a battery of individually controllable attacks - including jabs, head butts, and overhead kicks. They're up against a mob of Kung-Fu creeps and axe-hurling fiends. On the streets it's only two of them against hordes of attacking scum. Slam into pipe-wielding weirdos and bash 'em with their own metal. Throw an uppercut or an elbow smash - these goons keep comin'!", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/39192"}
