{"name": "Sonic the Hedgehog", "overview": "Sonic the Hedgehog was one of the games adapted for release in arcades using both Mega-Tech and Mega Play technology.<br><br>The Mega-Tech version is essentially the same as the Mega Drive game. The first two revisions of Sonic the Hedgehog have been used in various machines and cheat codes still work. Also, like all Mega-Tech games there is a time limit on how long the game can be played and high score table on the top screen. The time limit can be increased by inserting quarters.<br><br>The Mega Play version has a large number of differences from the Mega Drive game. First of all the second revision is used so the Scrolling clouds in Green Hill Zone are present. However, cheat codes cannot be used. 1-ups have no effect and continues are increased by inserting quarters. There are also only four Zones: Green Hill Zone, Spring Yard Zone, Star Light Zone, and Scrap Brain Zone (which is missing its final act). Special Stages are also missing and jumping into the Giant Rings only cause you to disappear. The credit roll is not used. You can also enter your initials on the High Score screen if you get a game over, either by running out of lives or finishing the game. There is also a strictly enforced time limit unique to each level. If the level isn't completed by that time you will die and the timer will be reset.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sonic Team", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/qrwTNqzvA3o", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/33396"}
