{"name": "Dark Edge", "overview": "Dark Edge is a 1992 fighting game by Sega for the Sega System 32. It uses sprite scaling to simulate a 3D playfield, meaning it predates Virtua Fighter as a 3D fighter by about a year (though the 3D in Virtua Fighter isn't simulated, but rather true rendered 3D graphics). You can play as either warriors or monsters, but otherwise this is a typical fighting game with a dedicated jump button (as Up moves back). Although the title screen reads \"1992\", the arcade game was first sold in early 1993.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "January 1, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.91", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBXZ9f-dCMM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/31959"}
