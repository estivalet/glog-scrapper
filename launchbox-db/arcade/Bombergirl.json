{"name": "Bombergirl", "overview": "Bombergirl is played similarly to other Bomberman games. Two four-player teams play the game at a time and control one of several different characters, in matches where the goal is to destroy the other team's base. The players can place bombs, as well as use character-specific abilities; for instance, Shiro can place several bombs, Momoko can create blocks, Oren can move quickly, and Emera can use ranged attacks. Throughout the match, characters' levels are raised, allowing the player to use special attacks such as a beam sword and a flaming sword. After a match, the losing team's characters' clothing takes damage.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "2017", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "8", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/99676"}
