Melee attacks are also possible.<br><br>Each of the stages has a different theme and a boss with a bounty at the end. The settings for the stage are the wild west, army, dilapidated industrial zone, football stadium and a mad scientists lab. Enemies attack the player directly or shoot projectiles at them.
