{"name": "High Voltage", "overview": "Mankind has conquered much of the universe and brought many alien races under their dominion. But now, in the year 3030, a rebellion has broken out centered about the planet of Regit. You have been dispatched in the star-ship \"High Voltage\" to quell the insurrection.<br><br>High Voltage is a first person space shoot-em-up with a 3D perspective. Each stage starts in space, and ends up on the surface of the planet, culminating in a fight with a boss machine. At any time, enemy vessels may approach and fire at you. You may either fire back after aiming at the enemy or a missile with the cross-hairs, or avoid by moving the cross-hairs off to one side causing your vessel to turn in that direction. Being hit with a projectile will cause enough damage to crack your view-port, and lose one of your lives. In addition to the standard rapid-fire lasers, which may overheat if used excessively, you have a limited supply of bombs which cause greater damage to a larger area.<br><br>For each stage, your arrival at the planet surface intercepts an ABO transporter. Destroying this vessel provides you with a robotic companion who can detect bonuses hidden just below the surface of the planet, retrieve extra missiles for your use from the surface, and provides in-game commentary. ABO can retrieve more missiles each time three bonus stars are collected.<br><br>The game is finished once the player completes stage 99, which requires a clue hidden throughout the earlier stages.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/36744"}
