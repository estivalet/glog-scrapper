{"name": "Downhill Bikers", "overview": "Downhill Bikers is a racing arcade game that was released by Namco in 1997; running on Namco's System 23 hardware, its gameplay is similar to that of the Suzuka 8 Hours duology (1992-1993) and Motocross Go! (also 1997), but with mountain bikes instead of motorcycles. As in Motocross Go!, up to four players can play simultaneously, when a pair of two-player cabinets are linked together - and each of the game's four biker characters, who are assigned by the players' numbers, have their own unique arrays of air tricks, which are performed by jumping over obstacles. According to the game's flyer (which is shown in the image to the right), it also has hidden characters; the courses also have multiple paths that can be taken through them (and some paths have more resistance than others).", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1997", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/35982"}
