{"name": "Wipe Out", "overview": "Wipe Out is a copy of Elimination! (Kee Games, 1973) and Quadrapong (Atari, 1974).<br><br>It's a ball & paddle game for 2 or 4 players where each player must defend his sidewall. If the ball passes through one of the players side, this player loses one point (from a total of 5 or 7 points). If this total reaches 0, this player is game over.<br><br>But the main differential feature of Wipe Out is this deflective central bumper.<br>Licensed by Volly as Countdown. Midway Leader is a clone of Wipe Out.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1974", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ramtek", "publishers": "Ramtek", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcT1U9dVtgw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40157"}
