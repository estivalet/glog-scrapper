{"name": "Touch Me", "overview": "Touch-Me was produced by Atari in 1974.<br><br>A \"Simon Says\" type game in which you must push the buttons in the same order that they light up. Each time that you do so, the game will light up another sequence with one more button added. The game did not prove profitable as pinball machines and video games proved more attractive that pressing light-up buttons. The controls were just 4 buttons that light up. In 1977, Milton Bradley released a home version knockoff of Touch-Me called Simon that added tones to the light patterns. Simon was the biggest selling toy of Christmas 1977. In 1978, Atari released a handheld version called Touch Me (no hyphen) that did not do as well (possibly because Atari's home game had small, closely-spaced buttons).", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1974", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atari", "publishers": "Atari", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/39747"}
