{"name": "Major Title", "overview": "The Irem Skins Game is an arcade-style golf simulation. The game is presented in a mixed perspective. The pre-shot perspective is a standard third-person view from just behind the golfer, but once the ball is hit, the view switches to a top-down perspective to track the ball in flight. The game takes a simplified approach to hitting the ball. Instead of setting the power and controlling the shot, the only function of the vertically oriented swing meter is to select the vertical angle of the shot, which, in turn, sets the amount of backspin/topspin applied to the ball. The strength of each swing is selected prior to the shot by setting a power gauge to one of 16 levels. Draw and fade can be applied to the ball by changing the players stance. However, the game specifies the maximum distance for the putter in yards (but measures distance on the greens in meters).", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Irem", "publishers": "Irem", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=671WBJfDWtM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/37492"}
