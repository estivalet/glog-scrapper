{"name": "Circus Charlie", "overview": "In the game there are six regular stages (plus an extra stage) of differing tasks that are to be completed by Charlie. Grabbing money bags, performing dangerous tricks, avoiding enemies, completing stages, etc., earns Charlie points. After the sixth stage is completed, the game starts over again but with a faster pace and more difficult (but exactly the same in terms of task to be completed) levels.<br>Charlie also races against time. Bonus points are awarded according to the time remaining, but running out of time will cost the player a life.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "January 1, 1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Centuri", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.73", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tpLHpxzfa0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/31217"}
