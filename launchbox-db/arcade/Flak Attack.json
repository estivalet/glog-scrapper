{"name": "Flak Attack", "overview": "MX 5000 was produced by Konami in 1987.<br><br>Pilot a jet fighter in this vertical scrolling shoot-em-up. Fire missiles at aircraft and bomb ground targets. Features end-of-level bosses, good music, digitized speech, big explosions, and lots of power-ups.<br><br>The game is good looking graphically but features a jerky looking scrolling background. It's quite tough to play and looks more like a 1990's shoot-em-up than a late 80's game. It's a small sized PCB, approximately six inches square, and features a large number of Konami custom chips, similar in look to \"Rush 'n' Attack.\" The digitized speech, apart from 'congratulations', is really hard to understand.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.92", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivxaKT1uslM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/37788"}
