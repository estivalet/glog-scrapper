{"name": "Funky Bee", "overview": "A raster monitor game where the player is a bee with a stinger. You fly over flowers for points and must avoid the trees and fires as well as the enemy bugs. You may use your stinger to kill bugs, but only one stinger is allowed on the screen at a time.<br><br>The game is in a mini sized cabinet. Very like a cabaret but it has a marquee and the control panel and tinted monitor glass lift together to give access to the display.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Orca", "publishers": "Orca", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZyHkoYhbvk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/36299"}
