{"name": "Liberation", "overview": "Liberation is a 2D scrolling top down shooter. The game has two sections - first, the player controls a helicopter, flies over forests, shoots enemies and searches villages. After the helicopter lands, the player controls a tank or other vehicle and must rescue prisoners in the village. Shooting in the helicopter section is quite typical, but as opposed to most other top down shooters, the screen isn't automatically just vertically moving, the player can freely fly over the battlefield (but he can shoot only forward). Tank control is similar to Jackal - the vehicle moves and shoots in every direction. In garages, the tank can be replaced by a jeep.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Data East", "publishers": "Data East", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.45", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/37181"}
