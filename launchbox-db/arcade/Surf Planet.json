{"name": "Surf Planet", "overview": "Surf Planet is a 3D arcade snowboarding game played using a behind view. It uses a standing cabinet system with a single joystick for control. Optionally two cabinets can be linked for competitive play. There are four riders to choose from as well as four courses with an increasing difficulty: Mt. Cook, Mt. Blanc, Mt. Mc Kinley and Lake Tahoe. The races are done starting with a helicopter drop against three opponents and it is possible to hinder each other. The game uses a rock soundtrack.<br><br>While riding there is a time limit and checkpoints need to be reached soon enough to extend the time and continue the race. The game encourages doing stunts and looking for shortcuts. Optimal speed can be achieved by collecting snowboard wax. This fills a meter in the top right corner, ranging from bad to perfect, which influences the maximum speed.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Zigurat Software S.L.", "publishers": "Atari", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.88", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D32xn8DNafY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/39403"}
