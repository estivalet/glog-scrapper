{"name": "M\u00e4rchen Maze", "overview": "M\u00e4rchen Maze (\"m\u00e4rchen\" means fairy tale in German) is an isometric platform/shooter game loosely based on Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland novels.<br><br>The game's story begins as Alice is awakened in the middle of the night by a voice from her mirror, it's Tokei Usagi (who is the game's equivalent of the White Rabbit), he needs Alice's help to rescue the world of mirrors from the Dark Queen who has conquered it. Alice must knock enemies over the edge with her bubble blower through nine different worlds, collecting various power-ups, such as rabbit shields and super jump shoes, along the way. Holding down the fire button generates bigger bubbles, resulting in greater knockback strength. However, various enemies are also trying to knock Alice off by firing colored marbles that can push Alice over the edge unless they are avoided or jumped over. There's also a 3 minute time limit for each round and if you run out of time the invincible Jikangire Monster will appear and automatically force Alice off the edge of the platforms if he touches her.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "N.H.
