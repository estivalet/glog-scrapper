{"name": "Rush'n Attack", "overview": "There are four distinct sections of gameplay, taking in a Missile Base, a Harbour, a Bridge, and an enemy Prison Camp. Extra weapons with limited ammunition can be collected along the way, which will make the task a lot easier. The level is divided into 3 horizontal levels, which can be moved between either by jumping or using ladders, and this gives a chance to avoid the more threatening mobs of enemy fighters.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "July 1, 1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.69", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24NOYh6g7vY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/16881"}
