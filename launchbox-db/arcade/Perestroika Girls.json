{"name": "Perestroika Girls", "overview": "- Perestroika Girls is a Qix variant and does not even try to go beyond that. Some of it\u2019s notable gameplay features:<br><br>*You can move backwards and erase your line while drawing.<br>*If you stay still for too long, you start getting chased by fire.<br>*Hearts bounce around. You can get them for points.<br>*Gems give you powerups. You can get shields, speed, stop time, and other fun stuff.<br><br>Other than that, Perestroika Girl is just a Qix knock-off with pornographic art as your reward. Just claim more than 80% of the picture and you get to see the whole thing. The pictures start pretty tame, usually with the girl fully dressed, but then after clearing enough levels, you start to see her in increasingly revealing outfits until she\u2019s nude. This is supposedly the main draw on Perestroika Girls. It\u2019s a video game where you get to see drawings of naked women if you win. Woo. This is totally something that will appeal to a wide audience and receive worldwide acclaim as the best game of all time. Cartoon boobs as a reward should be in every game. Whoever thought of this idea has revolutionized the way games are designed. Woo.<br><br>Cool Fact- The girls you uncover have gray skin before you beat the level. They look like gray alien shapeshifters that way.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.38", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/38075"}
