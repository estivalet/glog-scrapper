{"name": "Great Bishi Bashi Champ ", "overview": "A game that features 142 mini-games that are generated at random when you choose between modes. It has an interactive difficulty system, in which the difficulty changes depending on how many games you passed/failed in a row. Because of that, the difficulty between stages becomes increasingly more challenging. Each stage ends with a \"boss battle\".<br><br>After the game, a score table will show up, comparing your score to the target score. If it matches, or is better than the target score, you will get rise in rank, which is shown at the bottom of the screen, and will not lose a life. If it is worse, a crowd booing sound will be heard, and you will lose a life.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "2002", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami Corporation", "publishers": "Konami Corporation", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "3", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/130648"}
