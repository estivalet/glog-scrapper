{"name": "Prehistoric Isle 2", "overview": "Prehistoric Isle 2 is complete madness.  You pick one of two available helicopters, and blast your way through six increasingly difficult stages.  The only thing in your way are dinosaurs, which just so happen to have the ability to breath fire, shoot lasers, and want nothing more than to see you perish!  It\u2019s completely insane, and that\u2019s what makes it so bloody great!  It doesn\u2019t hurt any that the game was developed by the same people who made the excellent Blazing Star and Pulstar so you know you\u2019re in for a good time.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Yumekobo", "publishers": "SNK", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCUuVrxNH2A", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2319"}
