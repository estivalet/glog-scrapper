{"name": "A.D. 2083", "overview": "A.D. 2083 is an arcade space shooter similar to Time Pilot. One or two players control a space ship using an 8-way joystick and a single button to fire. The ship is shown from a side view and enemy ships appear from the bottom or merge from the background in the battle before they can be shot, using a pseudo 3D effect. There is also side-scrolling that goes into effect only when the player's ship moves, also adding to the 3D effect as the background moves as well, but much slower. There is no vertical scrolling, but the horizontal scrolling is endless as it wraps around.<br><br>The gameplay is endless, but the loop consists of three phases followed by an extra battle. Each phase is identical in gameplay, but with a different environment and enemies. Shooting down enemies is rewarded with points and this fills up a status bar near the top of the screen. When full the mission is complete and the next phase starts. A Hyperjump Power bar is filled based on the points when a mission is complete. The player starts with four lives and an extra ship is provided for every 20,000 point. The extra battle is a conquest phase of Atomic City where a radiation tower needs to be destroyed. The tower takes a lot of hits, shoots and launches enemies.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Midcoin", "publishers": "Midcoin", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.16", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ow4MTLzgTvw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/26118"}
