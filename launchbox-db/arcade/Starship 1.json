{"name": "Starship 1", "overview": "Starship 1 is an arcade game developed, manufactured, and released by Atari in 1977. Starship 1 was later ported to the Atari VCS by Bob Whitehead as Star Ship.<br><br>The object of Starship 1 is to destroy alien spacecraft while maneuvering through star and asteroid fields.<br><br>The game uses a first person perspective on a black-and-white monitor. The player's ship is controlled with a control yoke that is connected to two potentiometers. There is also a lever that controls whether the ship is moving \"fast\" or \"slow\". Compared to common arcade games of the time, Starship 1 was comparatively advanced, but used quite a bit of analog technology that would become less common in arcade games in following years.<br><br>As enemies appear onscreen, the player tries to center the enemy in the crosshairs and shoot it with his \"phasors\" by pulling a trigger on the control yoke. Alternatively, the player has 5 \"proton torpedoes\" per game that can be fired by pressing a large white button on the dashboard. This will destroy any enemy ship on screen, regardless of whether it is in the crosshairs (which are painted directly on the screen).<br><br>The enemy ships are roughly patterned after ships from Star Trek: The Original Series and the title device from the 1967 episode \"The Doomsday Machine\".<br><br>The player does not view the game monitor directly; the monitor is recessed in the cabinet, and the player views a reflected image of the monitor in a half-silvered mirror with a space background.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "July 1, 1977", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atari", "publishers": "Atari", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.88", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtube.com/watch?v=RWMf-TSWxsM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/39148"}
