{"name": "Atlant Olimpic", "overview": "A multi-event sport game - an update of Konami's 1983 classic, \"Track and Field\" - released to tie in with the 1996 Olympic Games, held in Atlanta, USA. This bootleg was only released in Italy. The only notable differences between this and the original \"Track & Field\" lie in a number of small changes to the background graphics (to tie the game in with Atlanta), and a greater visual variety of athletes; with both male and female competitors represented; the male athletes now sporting beards instead of the moustaches of the original.<br><br>There is also a greater variety in the athletes' skin tones on the game's title screen, giving the game a more 'international flavour'.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Georgia", "publishers": "Georgia", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.73", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEcwfXkZLkg&feature=emb_logo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/126883"}
