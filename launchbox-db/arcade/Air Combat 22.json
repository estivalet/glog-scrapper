{"name": "Air Combat 22", "overview": "Air Combat 22 is the arcade sequel to the first Air Combat in the long running Ace Combat series. You pilot one of three planes, a F14 Tomcat, Su-27 or the F22 Raptor. The sequel comes with improved graphics and again uses semi-realistic physics. The objective is to destroy enemy planes using guns or missiles over a succession of sorties and missions. A radar shows the location of enemy planes in relation to your own and on-screen arrows point towards the nearest enemy. Each mission starts with a enemy counter that decreases as enemy planes are dispatched of. The enemy count has to be taken down to zero before a timer runs out, else it is game over. A bonus stage has the player landing on an aircraft carrier for points. Later missions involve air-to-air refuelling and attacking enemy aircraft carriers and bases.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "June 1, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Namco", "publishers": "Namco", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.09", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMfYmvp3WwE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/11611"}
