The game is over when the tiles reach the top of the screen.<br><br>Upon starting the game, players can choose between playing a regular game, either alone or competing against a second player, or pick between three arena formats (normal, large and diagonal) for single player only.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.43", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/36727"}
