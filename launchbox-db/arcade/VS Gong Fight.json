{"name": "VS Gong Fight", "overview": "VS Gong Fight is a boxing arcade game, that was released by Kaneko in 1984 and licensed to Taito Corporation for US manufacture and distribution, under the name of Ring Fighter; it utilizes two Zilog Z80 microprocessors (running at 4 MHz), with a General Instrument AY-3-8910 running at 2 MHz and a DAC for audio. The players must use a 4-way joystick to take up control of a boxer (1P's wears blue gloves, trunks and boots, but 2P's wears red ones), with two buttons to make them punch and block - and if only one player is playing the game, 2P's boxer will be controlled by the CPU and silhouetted in black. Both boxers' energy levels are displayed in the top-left and top-right corners of the screen, with their \"damage\" levels in the bottom-left and bottom-right corners of it; the current round's number and its remaining time are also displayed in the top-centre of the screen. Just like in real boxing, you have to knock out your opponent before the time runs out, in order to proceed to the next round - and once you have done so, you shall have to face another CPU opponent, or it will be game over for the loser.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40020"}
