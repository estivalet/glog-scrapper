{"name": "Poker Ladies", "overview": "You are trying to get a certain specified number of points by getting poker hands ranging from of a pair of Jacks to a royal flush. If you get to the highest point level for that girl, you can \"play\" with her (the game's wording) by pressing the \"Deal\" button repeatedly. There are nine girls. Once you get through them all there is a closing sequence then the game starts over again. The \"Flip Screen\" button causes the screen to flip upside down perhaps for use in a cocktail cabinet.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mitchell", "publishers": "Capcom", "genres": "Casino", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECux5hw0gOM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/12227"}
