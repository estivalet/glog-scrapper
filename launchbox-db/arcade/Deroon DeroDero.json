{"name": "Deroon DeroDero", "overview": "Deroon DeroDero is a puzzle game similar to Puyo Puyo and was released exclusively in Japan in 1995 by Tecmo. It was later released on Sony Playstation as Tecmo Stackers.<br>Players try to connect sets of four blocks so that their colors match, causing the blocks to be removed. Remaining blocks may then fall and complete other sets of four blocks. The main difference between Tecmo Stackers and Puyo Pop is that blocks in Tecmo Stackers stretch in various directions after adjacent blocks are removed, and the \"arms\" they send out can complete sets of blocks and be removed; this allows for longer chain reactions.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Tecmo", "publishers": "Tecmo", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.35", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czSEEk290Gk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/77858"}
