{"name": "Ckidzo", "overview": "Ckidzo is a Pong variant with a twist. The paddles in the game are subject to inertia. They take some time to get to top speed and also can't come to a standstill immediately. The paddles can move in all directions and the ball must be led into goals (one for each team). The game allows for four players.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1976", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Meadows", "publishers": "Meadows", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/35563"}
