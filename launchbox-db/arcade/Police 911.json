{"name": "Police 911", "overview": "This unique game senses body movement rather than requiring the player to move individual controls.<br><br>Taking the role of a police officer, you start in Los Angeles and fight your way through the members of the Japanese mafia who are running guns from America to Japan. There are six bosses you must capture in LA and Japan, concluding with the head of the Criminal organization in Japan.<br>The player moves around shooting enemies and rescuing hostages. Unlike games such as Time Crisis or Maximum Force, the player uses his/her entire body in order to hide or shoot.<br><br>The player stands on a yellow foot pad, and interacts with the onscreen action by physically dodging left, right and ducking to avoid danger and reloading your weapon. Three infared sensors (L, R, Center), mounted on a bar overhead, detect the player's body position and reflect that information back to the game. These \"real world\" actions are reflected on the game screen by making your virtual character interact with obstacles within the game. This added level of interactivity surpasses the standard rail shooters of previous gun games", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/nqNVbbBV9lQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/38193"}
