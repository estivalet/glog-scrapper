{"name": "Sky Chuter", "overview": "Sky Chuter was produced by Irem in 1980.<br><br>In Sky Chuter, the player guides their missile launcher that must fire at planes that appear from the left and right edges of the screen, then make their way down towards the player. While they are homing in on the player, not only does the planes fire down on the player, but they also release parachutes containing bombs that must be dealt with before they reach the surface. Once the player manages to kill the last airplane, the game proceeds to the next pattern. If the player loses all their lives, the game ends.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1980", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Irem", "publishers": "Irem", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.21", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwaJUVSyb4c", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/38910"}
