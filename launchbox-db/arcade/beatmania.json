{"name": "beatmania", "overview": "The arcade game beatmania is the first in the music/rhythm series. The player chooses a song from a selection of twelve. To clear a song, the player has to hit the notes that appears in the screen to match the melody. There is also a scratchable turntable which the player can use to hit the notecharts. There is an energy bar which the player has to fill to successfully complete a song. That bar has a clear limit marked by a line. If the player doesn't fill the bar over the limit, the game is lost.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1997", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Music", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.94", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/35111"}
