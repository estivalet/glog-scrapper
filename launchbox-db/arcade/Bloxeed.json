{"name": "Bloxeed", "overview": "Bloxeed is a Tetris variant. The player is presented with an empty field and from the top there is one block at a time falling down. There are blocks of various forms available which can be rotated and moved left and right. The goal is create full lines which then disappear and reward points for the high score list. The more lines are cleared at once (the maximum are four), the more points are earned. When lines are cleared, the player's level rises and so does the falling speed of the blocks. At the top of the screen is a preview of the next block.<br><br>Besides this known principle, this game adds two features to the mix: in fixed intervals the game adds garbage blocks on the field (lines with one or two holes) and bonus blocks where a part of the block is replaced with a number or letter. When clearing it, the player is rewarded with one of five treats: a bird which drops blocks during descend, a satellite which shoots blocks, a bomb respectively a weight which destroy the blocks they land on and the last bonus clears four lines instantly.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega Enterprises Ltd.", "publishers": "Sega Enterprises Ltd.", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.86", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYHzIz6uqK8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/35229"}
