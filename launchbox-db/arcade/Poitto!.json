{"name": "Poitto!", "overview": "Poitto! Was developed by Metro Corporation and published by Able Corporation in 1993.<br><br>Poitto! is a puzzle game where the object is to match three bottles of the same color horizontally, vertically or diagonally to clear them. Match four bottles to cast a spell and attack the opponent. Make a chain reaction to attack with multiple spells. The game has two modes. In Vs. Mode you try to make your opponent's bottles reach the top while preventing your own from doing so. When you complete bottle lines, some of your opponents bottles will be turned into \"timer bottles\" which cannot be made to disappear until the timer runs out. In Monster Mode you play against monsters that have bounties on their heads and you need to get the monster's platform raised to the top so as to crush them.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Metro Corporation", "publishers": "Able Corporation", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuSGJ-mWuHs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/38173"}
