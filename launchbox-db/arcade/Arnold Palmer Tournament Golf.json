{"name": "Arnold Palmer Tournament Golf", "overview": "The Mega-Tech System is an arcade cabinet released by Sega in 1989, and Western counterpart to the Mega 6. It was based on the Sega Mega Drive home console, and was designed similarly to Nintendo's PlayChoice-10: players chose games from a menu of eight titles, with credits buying more play time (usually 1 minute per credit) rather than extra lives or continues; reaching a game over screen does not end the play session, and players can start over or choose a different game as long as there was some play time remaining. The Mega-Tech was not released in North America, though did see use in Asia and the PAL regions.<br><br>Arnold Palmer Tournament Golf was known as Naomichi Ozaki Super Masters in Japan. It is one of the early Sega sports games where a celebrity athlete's name was added to the title when it was localized from Japan (the other two games being Tommy Lasorda Baseball and Pat Riley Basketball). Although Arnold Palmer is shown on the box cover and at the title screen, the game makes no reference to him during the actual golf game play.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/hiTqCUUUXUw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138470"}
