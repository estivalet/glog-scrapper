The overall goal is to destroy the motherships that pop up periodically.<br><br>Super Xevious takes place on Earth. An invading alien race has set up shop, and it's up to the player to send 'em home. The game has a large number of different ground and air-based targets of either belligerent or non-belliegerent nature. In addition to the jumper-based difficulty levels, the game also adapts its difficulty to the player. If the player is successful against a type of attacker, an even deadlier type of attacker shows up to challenge the player.<br><br>The game play is very much like the original Xevious, but in this sequel, the play is a little more difficult. Several new enemies are introduced, including a silver Galaxian flagship, two jet planes, a helicopter, and a dark yellow tank.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Namco", "publishers": "Atari", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.85", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMQadOj_bJ8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/39398"}
