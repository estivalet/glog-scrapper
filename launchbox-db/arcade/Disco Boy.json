{"name": "Disco Boy", "overview": "In Disco Boy, the goal will be to complete several worlds each composed of 3 phases, the last being a boss. The hero of the game (who thinks a bit about the miserly and aggressive baby of the Griffin family [a Simpson family ersatz for those who do not know]) is armed with a gun and can shoot either upwards or downwards the side. To take a step, all enemies will have to be wiped out and the image in the background fully revealed.<br>Picture as a backdrop? And yes small vicious, these images are actually pulpy creatures that have as a matter of chance the common point of having all lost their bra. Well, it's always nice to rinse your eyes, you say. Yes, but frankly, these ladies are more the effect of bar trainer at three euros the pass than models Modigliani! Their presentation is dull, without relief (this is not a play on words), short without any particular attraction. It's fine if you only have it on hand, but with time, small player has become big and now knows feminine anatomy, at least I hope. So if you like to play and nicely rinse your eye, go back to Lady Killer, much more beautiful and more fun.<br><br>After all this little fan-service aspect, let's see the rest of the game. The least we can say is that the enemies that assail you compete with ridicule and grotesque, they all like your hero the expression Of a guy who just woke up and wondering what he's doing there. But the game also opts for a rather unusual and annoying gameplay that ends up making it mediocre not to say nil.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Soft Art Co.", "publishers": "Soft Art Co.", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.36", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hc-ZCnvuxc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/35917"}
