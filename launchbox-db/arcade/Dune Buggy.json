{"name": "Dune Buggy", "overview": "Dune Buggy, Midway, 2/72, #552. Inside the cabinet is large flat course. The dune buggy is attached to a boom and the player manuvers about the course against time while scoring points for clearing obstacles. Game is timed. Probably similar to the Midway Jet Rider (1/71).<br><br>Sound info thanks to Mark: uses a consumer-type 8-track player for background music. Each of the two stereo channels has a different tune. The same pair of tunes is on all four tracks of the 8-track tape. Both tunes are similar twangy-guitar surfing style music, 2 minutes 3 seconds long. Turns out the right channel has \"Lies\" by Randell and Charles, made famous by the Knickerbockers in the sixties.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/101268"}
