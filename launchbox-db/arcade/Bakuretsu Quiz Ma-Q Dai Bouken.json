{"name": "Bakuretsu Quiz Ma-Q Dai Bouken", "overview": "The players must help a soldier named Scott and a Mr. T lookalike named Stanley get back the three jewels of a crown that has been stolen by \"Yaminotsume Ky\u014d\" (written in Kanji and Hiragana as \"\u95c7\u306e\u722a\u6559\") by using four buttons to answer three-script Japanese questions of various categories; you will have a preset amount of time to answer each question in, and if you either fail to respond or answer it incorrectly, your character will lose a \"life-heart\", as their current situations at the bottom of the screen worsen. However, when you answer a question correctly, the amount of remaining time (multiplied by 10) will be added to your score as your character's current situations improve - and if you can answer enough questions correctly, you may score enough points to earn your character an extra \"life-heart\".", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Namco", "publishers": "Namco", "genres": "Quiz", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.6", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9no59Kd06U&ab_channel=FunCade64", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/35041"}
