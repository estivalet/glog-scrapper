There are three game modes and four golfers to choose from at the main menu: Stroke Play is the main single-player mode where one player compete against CPU-controlled opponents in 18 holes. Match Play is similar to the first mode, except that two players compete against each other and the player with the lowest score wins. In the last mode, Nassau Game, one player competes with either a CPU or another human opponent and the player with the lowest score wins, with events such as longest drive or closest to the pin constests appearing on occasions. Before starting each mode, players have the option of having a caddie for advices and tips in how to complete a course. If a memory card is present, the players are allowed to save their progress and resume into the last course the game's saved at.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "SNK", "publishers": "SNK", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.54", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/39717"}
