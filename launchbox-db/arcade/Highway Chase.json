{"name": "Highway Chase", "overview": "Hwy Chase is a vertical shoot-em-up in the style of Space Invaders and was released for arcade cabinets fitted with the Data East cassette system. You control a police car that is pursuing automobile driving miscreants in two stages. The first stage consists of a pattern or formation of cars with the occasional cars breaking formation to either shoot at or collide with you. The second stage consists of overtaking small groups of three cars that weave unpredictably between lanes. The two stages alternate until the end of the game.<br><br>Hitting a car or one of its shots will lose one of your three lives. You can move the car horizontally or vertically, but you can only shoot a single bullet at a time. Sometimes, the chase enters a tunnel, where you can only see cars within the range of your headlights.<br><br>The very similar game Mad Alien was released as a dedicated arcade machine.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1980", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/36747"}
