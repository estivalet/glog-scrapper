{"name": "Dungeons & Dragons: Computer Labyrinth Game", "overview": "The Dungeons & Dragons Computer Labyrinth Game is an electronic board game. The board appears as a plastic castle with a chess board sized grid in the middle. Underneath the superstructure is a drawer, in which can be found two metal warrior figures, a dragon, a treasure chest, plus a number of plastic pieces to be used as walls, and a couple of secret room markers.<br><br>The castle is also a computer of sorts, and the gridded playing surface is a touch sensitive key board. Each time the game is turned on the computer randomly creates an invisible labyrinth wherein lies the imaginary treasure, and the dragon.<br><br>A player moves his figurine from square to square; depending on what is in the square, an electronic sound would be triggered, allowing a player to figure out where walls were located. Another sound would indicate that the dragon's treasure hoard had been located, and between player turns, the \"Dragon\" sound would indicate that the dragon had moved one square.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1980", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Mattel", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/36044"}
