{"name": "Magic Johnson's Fast Break", "overview": "Magic Johnson's Fast Break is fast-paced two-on-two action rather than the usual five-on-five contest. On screen you get a full-court, horizontally-scrolling gameplay. A referee monitors the action and calls the fouls if the gameplay gets too rough, and a crowd cheers you on.<br><br>Your team starts each game at a certain salary level. Your goal is to beat the opposition to earn a larger salary. Keep winning and you might etch your name onto the Big Earners Screen. Choose from five skill levels - Rookie to Professional. Each level provides quicker gameplay, tougher defense, and bigger bucks if you win.<br><br>Each game lasts four three-minute, real-life quarters. In between quarters, you can review stats such as field goal percentage, three-pointers made, rebounds, and steals. If the score is tied at the final buzzer, you play additional quarters until someone wins.<br><br>You control one player at a time. An arrow appears on-screen above the head of the player you're running. Just hit B to switch players. You can play against the computer or up to three friends.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/37300"}
