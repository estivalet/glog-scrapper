{"name": "Dirt Devils", "overview": "Get behind the wheel of one of five super cars and experience the feel and strategy or real dirt racing. Hold on tight as you slide your super-charged off-road vehicle through unbelievably sharp turns, bottom-out in huge potholes, fly through dual level intersections, navigate through watery swamps, and attempt driving at night with only your headlights to guide you. A rear view mirror and on-board radar screen help you keep track of your competition, as you race for glory, on one of the 3 heart pounding courses. All this, while smashing into your opponents car(s) and collection valuable points, as you pass all the checkpoints in the allotted time.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "January 1, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Sega AM3 R&D Division", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/19105"}
