{"name": "Galaxia", "overview": "Galaxia is a Galaxian variant with a twist. The basis of the game remains the same, with the player controlling a spaceship at the bottom of the screen and enemy fighters coming in from the top in formation and with different types of behaviors. The player must avoid their projectiles and suicide attacks. What sets the game apart from Galaxian is that it copies the energy mechanic from Astro Wars, meaning the player can't waste their shots.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1979", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Zaccaria", "publishers": "Zaccaria", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.79", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewLGStvwj9E", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/36320"}
