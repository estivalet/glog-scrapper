{"name": "Angel Kids", "overview": "You must pull in two seperate directions to pull the rope tight and help your bouncy friend gain higher jumps. Also, you must watch the angle of re-entry so that you do not drop her! Balloons take multiple hits to pop and the last hit accelerates the flying kid and causes sharp change in angle.<br><br>Players take turns controlling two kids holding a rope. Pull the two joysticks outwards and the rope gets taunt. When timed right this throws a third kid into the balloons. The balloons are scrolled on screen, seven screens high. While the girl is in the air, the screen splits to show close-ups of the action. You must push up on the joysticks to advance the kids holding the rope.<br><br>This game appears to be a Japan only release. A lot of mute pastel colors make the sprites quite unusual looking.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "EXA Planning", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.57", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRlJs6LDX54", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/34948"}
