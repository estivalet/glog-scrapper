{"name": "Giga Wing 2", "overview": "Giga Wing 2 (\u30ae\u30ac\u30a6\u30a4\u30f3\u30b02?) is a 2000 vertical scrolling shooter arcade game developed by Takumi and published by Capcom on Sega's NAOMI arcade system board and later ported in 2001 to the Dreamcast console. The arcade version is notable both for its excessive scores (scores in the quintillions are not unheard of), and for using a horizontally aligned monitor (much like Treasure Co. Ltd's Radiant Silvergun), something that is considered rare for a vertical shooter.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Takumi", "publishers": "Capcom", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.32", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrDlFfW7FWE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/8752"}
