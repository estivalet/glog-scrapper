{"name": "Last Survivor", "overview": "Last Survivor is one of the first examples of a 3D third-person shooter, and involves players traversing a maze shooting at opponents. It pre-dates experiments by id Software (often credited for inventing the first person shooter genre) by two years. It relies on rotary joystick controllers, and had then-revolutionary ray-casting graphics. As an early example of the genre, its gameplay is slower and less fluid than modern third person shooters.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega AM1", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.08", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnmE1Zu0R2g", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/37155"}
