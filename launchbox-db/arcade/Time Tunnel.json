{"name": "Time Tunnel", "overview": "Time Tunnel is an arcade game by Taito where the player must navigate a train through a maze-like series of tracks while accomplishing various objectives, all while avoiding enemies and collecting enough fuel to last through each level. Unlike most other maze chase games of the era, the player cannot navigate the maze directly, but instead must rely on their ability to switch the direction of track junctions while moving forward and backward. <br><br>There are three levels with unique objectives: in the first the player must back into certain sections of the maze to attach passenger cars, in the second they must stop at stations to fill each car with three passengers, and lastly they must drop all of their passengers off at space stations. (Did I mention you are a space train?)<br><br>When the three levels are completed, the player can play again at a higher difficulty to achieve a high score.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Taito", "publishers": "Taito", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.6", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/7548"}
