{"name": "Police 911 2", "overview": "Police 911, called The Keisatsukan (\u30b6\u30fb\u8b66\u5bdf\u5b98, lit. The Police Officer) in Japan and Police 24/7 in Europe, is a series of light gun shooter arcade games. Konami released the first game in 2000.<br><br>Unlike earlier light gun games, the game was unique for its motion sensing technology, sensing body movement rather than requiring the player to move individual controls; the player's \"real world\" actions are reflected by the player character within the game. It also featured a unique cover system, where the player takes cover by physically ducking for cover rather than pressing a button. The 2001 Konami arcade game MoCap Boxing used similar motion-sensing technology.<br><br>Although the game was a separate canon from the Lethal Enforcers series, Konami acknowledged Lethal Enforcers 3 as the successor to the Police 911 series, thus making it a canon in the Lethal Enforcers series.<br><br>The gameplay in Police 911 can be considered more interactive than most light gun games; instead of merely standing in one place and shooting enemies before the player is shot, the game uses infrared sensors to determine a player's location; through this, the player is able to dodge around (with the knees, while standing on the pad), duck to avoid bullets (and reload), and lean out to maximize cover and get a better shot. This is not foolproof, however; enemies will continue to shoot while the player is hiding, so it is possible to be hit upon rising from cover. Also, like Time Crisis, the timer is continually running down, so one cannot hide for very long.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "2001", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/38194"}
