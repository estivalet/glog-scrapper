{"name": "Alien Storm (Mega-Tech)", "overview": "The Mega-Tech System is an arcade cabinet released by Sega in 1989, and Western counterpart to the Mega 6. It was based on the Sega Mega Drive home console, and was designed similarly to Nintendo's PlayChoice-10: players chose games from a menu of eight titles, with credits buying more play time (usually 1 minute per credit) rather than extra lives or continues; reaching a game over screen does not end the play session, and players can start over or choose a different game as long as there was some play time remaining. The Mega-Tech was not released in North America, though did see use in Asia and the PAL regions.<br><br>Alien Storm is a 1990 beat 'em up shooter arcade game by Sega. It was later ported to the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis and Master System.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.54", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/139904"}
