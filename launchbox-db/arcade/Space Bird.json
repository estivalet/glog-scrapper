{"name": "Space Bird", "overview": "A bootleg version of Space Firebird with some differences. The bootleg publisher, Karateco was so brazen as to put the Nintendo name on their advertisements. Like in Space Firebird, in Space Bird your ship has wandered into an asteroid field full of creatures called Space Firebirds. They are not friendly, and they immediately attack. There are three kinds of Space Firebird: Gulls take one hit to destroy, Eagles two, and the Mighty Emperors require four. They fire back, their shots sometimes exploding in all directions. They also move around in looping formations, potentially hitting you and making them harder to shoot.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1980", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nintendo", "publishers": "Karateco", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133297"}
