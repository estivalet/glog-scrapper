{"name": "Puzzli 2", "overview": "Puzzli 2 is a puzzle game and sequel to Metro's Puzzli. Gameplay remains the same - when three of the same kind of fish are at the water surface you can catch them. Catch all fish to clear a stage. If they go beneath the \"dead line\" it's game over. Like the first game there's single player, as well as two player versus mode.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "IGS", "publishers": "IGS", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=UCBJaWcPrG8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/38348"}
