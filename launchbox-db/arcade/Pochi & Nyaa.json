{"name": "Pochi & Nyaa", "overview": "Far beyond our own dimension, on a planet not too different from ours, lies a magical land that is home to all sorts of gods. But the gods the denizens worship most of all are Pochi, the god of dogs, and Nyaa, the god of cats. Every 1000 years, these two gods hold a \"Pochi and Nyaa\" tournament to determine which god shall rule the heavens in the millennium to come. But, in order to hold this tournament, they'll need all the mortal help they can get. And that's where our heroine, the novice mage (and sweets lover) Prim, enters the picture...<br><br>Pochi to Nyaa is a puzzle game where a single player controlling Prim must fight through a series of kooky characters in hopes of making the millennial Pochi and Nyaa tournament go off without a hitch. To do so, Prim must stack up Nyans of the same color together and set them off by turning a Nyan into a Spiky Nyan. (The more Nyans, tails and/or splits involved, the higher the attack power.) Depending on how powerful the attack is, Intruders (dogs) will drop on the opposing side's field. When the opponent is drowned in a flood of cute animals, it's Game Over.<br><br>In addition to Story Mode, the player can fight in head-to-head battles - against either the CPU or a friend.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "2003", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Aiky", "publishers": "Taito", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.96", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/38166"}
