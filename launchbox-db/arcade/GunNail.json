{"name": "GunNail", "overview": "GunNail is a vertically scrolling shoot 'em up produced by NMK and Tecmo in 1993. The player controls a spaceship which can be equipped with straight, spread, or homing lasers. The game has a high difficulty curve, as all power-ups are lost upon death and the colorful sprites and screen effects make enemy projectiles difficult to avoid.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "January 1, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "NMK", "publishers": "NMK", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRUCU2dI7gE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/34078"}
