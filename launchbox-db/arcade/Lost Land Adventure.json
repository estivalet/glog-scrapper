{"name": "Lost Land Adventure", "overview": "Lost Land Adventure, an arcade light gun shooter, stands out for its massive size and screen. Created by Bandai Namco on the Namco System ES3 board, the game first hit Japan in the summer of 2014. One to two players sit inside of the enclosed video theater cabinet and domed screen, exploring ruins, blasting enemies and collecting treasure along the way!<br><br>Players join the experienced treasure hunter Jack on an expedition into remote locations throughout the world in search of hidden treasures. The treasures located on the map will not be easy to retrieve as many obstacles and creatures stand in the way. Use quick reflexes to blast away at enemies shown on a huge 180\u00b0 degree seamless Curved Projection Monitor.<br><br>Adventurers will also have to solve puzzles in the game to advance! With four selectable stages, choose your own adventures and save your game progress with the included PIN System. When you complete all four stages, the game unlocks an additional, challenging fifth stage to play.  Depending on how well you play and what treasures to collect, you will be treated to different endings!
