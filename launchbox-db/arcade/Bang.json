{"name": "Bang", "overview": "A cartoony first-person 2-D Wild West shooter from Gaelco.<br><br><br>The game is a remake -- not a copy -- of Namco's Point Blank. The western-themed game has several mini-games that the player can choose to play. For example, one of these mini-games has a train that scrolls from right to left and cowboys pop up from the windows. Another places the player in a prairie where he or she must shoot feathers off of the Indians' heads. Yet another has cowboys throwing their hats into the air and the player must shoot these flying objects.<br>The presentation is also very similar to Point Blank. At the beginning, the mini-game instructions appear the same (\"shoot five of this ...\", \"do not shoot that ...\"), then the amount of bullets and time are displayed (again, exactly the same) and then the game starts. Even the timer in the bottom-middle of the screen looks the same. However, the guns are a bit smaller and simpler and they have no force feedback.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bit Managers", "publishers": "Gaelco", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.04", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSEyENZMHy0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/35055"}
