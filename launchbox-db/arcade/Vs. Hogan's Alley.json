{"name": "Vs. Hogan's Alley", "overview": "Hogan's Alley is a 1984 video game by Nintendo. It was one of the first games to use a light gun as an input device. The game presents players with \"cardboard cut-outs\" of gangsters and innocent civilians. The player must shoot the gangs and spare the innocent people. The game is available on the Nintendo Entertainment System and as a Nintendo VS. System Game Pak, which was installed into VS. System Arcade cabinets, both upright and the \"Red Tent\" Cocktail. The controls consist of a single light gun. This was a rather novel input device for a game of its time and added to its appeal.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.23", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40034"}
