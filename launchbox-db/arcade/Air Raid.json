It is also known as Cross Shooter, it's the predecessor to \"Raiden\".<br><br>The game is a vertically-scrolling shoot 'em up. Unlike other Seibu shmups, this one is a Cute 'em Up, with bright-colored pastel graphics very similar to TwinBee. Players are equipped with a forward firing shot and limited bombs. Enemies will drop colored power-ups whose color will continuously cycle, each color equipping the ship with a different upgrade. This power-up system would later make it's way into the Raiden series.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Seibu Kaihatsu", "publishers": "Seibu Kaihatsu", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.45", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/7588"}
