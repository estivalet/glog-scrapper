{"name": "Snacks'n Jaxson", "overview": "Snacks 'n Jaxson was produced by Bally Sente in 1984.<br><br>Snack 'n Jackson sees you playing a clown sitting at a dining table, overlooked by two cabinets on either side. From these cabinets and from the player's perspective, food is swirling around the clown's head. The objective is to stick out the clown's neck and grab all the food he can possible eat, whilst avoiding spicy food like green peppers and soap boars. All this while bouncing a dismembered nose, which can be used to sneeze away the unwanted items and grabbing back the nose before it crashes through the window behind you. For each meal you must catch 6 sets of foodstuffs (each set indicated by a number on your clown's chest). One has to eat/play for breakfast, lunch, snack and dinner time to advance to the next day. Bonus rounds between days see your gather bonus point for extra noses (essentially continues).", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bally Sente", "publishers": "Bally Sente", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.81", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMcaM28fz44", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/38937"}
