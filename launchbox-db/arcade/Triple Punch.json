{"name": "Triple Punch", "overview": "A maze/outline game where you're the carpenter and your task is to complete the squares until you've filled the screen. Sound easy? Not when you hear what's trying to stop you. A gorrila, ghost, eraser and burst of fire all wander the paths. The eraser erases uncompleted squares and the gorilla would love to hammer you. But you're not defenseless. With three swift punches you can knock them out, except for the fire which can't be stopped. Each level introduces a larger area to fill so keep moving!", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "KKI", "publishers": "KKI", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.77", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDM1_EiRdgM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/39800"}
