{"name": "Street Fighter Zero 2 Alpha", "overview": "An updated version of Zero 2, Street Fighter Zero 2 Alpha features all the additional characters from Alpha 2, as well as other changes to the game. In addition to Zangief and Dhalsim, Zero 2 Alpha also features EX versions of Ryu, Ken, Chun-Li, Sagat and M. Bison, all whom were characters from the original Street Fighter II': Champion Edition.  Custom Combos are now executed by pressing a punch and kick button of the same strength simultaneously and now require half (1\u00bd level) of the Super Combo gauge filled to perform them. Some of the characters have gained new moves such as Ryu's Shakunetsu Hadoken and Dhalsim's Yoga Tempest. Zero 2 Alpha also features a Survival Mode, as well as a 2-on-1 Dramatic Battle Mode similar to the hidden \"Ryu and Ken vs. Bison mode\" in the original Alpha. In the Japanese version of Zero 2 Alpha, Evil Ryu has different dialogue exchanges and a different ending from his regular counterpart. The game also features an arranged version of the Alpha 2 soundtrack.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "August 1, 1996", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Capcom", "publishers": "", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.26", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/34248"}
