{"name": "Crossfire", "overview": "The game required two players, each with a \u201cgun\u201d, at opposite sides of the playfield. Each player had a vertical position knob (a potentiometer like Pong) and a fire button. Each gun could have one shot in the air at a time. There was a big ball, which started at the center, and there were small bumpers in the playfield that made the ball bounce. You tried to \u201cpush\u201d the ball into your opponent\u2019s goal line by shooting it. Each hit added a little energy and it took multiple hits to get the speed of the ball up, but then you had to watch out for rebounds off the bumpers.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1975", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atari", "publishers": "", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF76Z1HiOnA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106198"}
