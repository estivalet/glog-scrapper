{"name": "Escape Kids", "overview": "Escape Kids is a racing game for up to four players but instead of driving or riding a vehicle you control a kid who has to run round a single screen track over various races. There are five competitors running with the black clothed runner the champion, and to progress to the next race, one player must beat him. Each race is three laps and each player can use a fire-button to speed up and each player has a limited amount of super-jumps. There are various obstacles to avoid and bumping into another racer slows you down. Icons appear and these can speed you up, give a super-jump or create an earthquake where all the racers fall over. Once three laps have been completed by one racer then the results are shown before each player can increase various stats, like reduced skidding, get stronger, more super-jumps or get up quicker. If a player wins three races in a row then they can ride a bike in a bonus game trying to get more money.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.56", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5f3eMpMi6g", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/36097"}
