{"name": "Boong-Ga Boong-Ga", "overview": "The game's purpose is to relieve a stress caused by the people that make your life miserable. The list goes as follow: ex-girlfriend, ex-boyfriend, gangster, mother-in-law, gold digger, prostitute, child molester and con-artist.<br><br>The objective is simple, ram a plastic finger up a virtual ass as hard as you can. The cabinet features a mold of a bent over backside, and a screen that displays the expression of the person your ravaging. The harder you shove, the more the character screams in pain, all while you score points. It is technically a prize game, and it spits out cards that \"explain your sexual behaviour.\" Successfully penetrating to a point the game deems passable earns you a small plastic feces model.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Taff System", "publishers": "Taff System", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.88", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/35257"}
