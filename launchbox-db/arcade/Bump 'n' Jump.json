This is useful to jump over enemy cars if there are too many in the way, and must also be used to jump gaps in the roadway and other highway obstacles. As the levels progress, the road becomes narrower with more obstacles in the way, and the other cars increase in number and in aggressiveness.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Data East", "publishers": "Bally Midway", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.08", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWIZGBnUTWI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/35320"}
