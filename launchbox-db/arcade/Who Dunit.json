They player uses the lightgun to shoot hazards and deadly enemies trying to kill Max. The lightgun is also used to trigger openings to help Max navigate and on Max himself to get him to perform an action such as jumping or landing safely. Max can take a limited number of hits from hazards and enemies (one hit from certain hazards like stalagmites), before he dies and the game is over. The goal is to find the key to the chest in the attic to reveal the identity of the one who committed murder in the manor. After that the game loops with no real ending.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.08", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40107"}
