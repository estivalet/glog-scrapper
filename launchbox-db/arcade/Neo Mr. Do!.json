{"name": "Neo Mr. Do!", "overview": "Neo Mr. Do! is an enhanced version of Mr. Do!, and features greatly improved graphics, stereo sound, and intermissions that can be viewed when an area is completed. You can also travel to the bonus stages, where the object is to make your way toward the exit by carefully dropping apples to create a path. These bonus stages can be reached by killing all enemies on the screen, rather than collecting all the items that are in groups.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Universal Co., Ltd.", "publishers": "Visco", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.22", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj_nSBzTZeE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27004"}
