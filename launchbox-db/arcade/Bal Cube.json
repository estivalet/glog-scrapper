{"name": "Bal Cube", "overview": "Bal Cube is an Arkanoid-style game with a twist. Instead of controlling the paddle, you control the ball, which in this game is in the form of a spinning blue cube. Various blocks, such as diamonds and circles, which bounce the cube in a different direction depending on how they are hit, advance down from the top of the screen. The goal is to clear every block on the screen. When the cube hits one of the triangular platforms at the bottom, the blocks advance and the platform disappears, and if one is already gone, the missing platform returns. The player loses a life when the cube falls into a hole, or if the blocks reach the bottom of the screen. The game also has various power-ups: Change shrinks the cube, Slow reduces it's speed, Vanish destroys every block on screen, Option allows you to break steel blocks in one hit, while Arrow can break through multiple blocks.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Metro Corporation", "publishers": "Metro Corporation", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.88", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOLR0Wfb8k0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/35043"}
