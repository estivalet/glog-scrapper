{"name": "The Crystal of Kings", "overview": "Once long ago, the land was governed by kings who wielded crystals, orbs of magic that rival the power of the gods. Amongst them was an ambitious man named Nightspirit, who grew corrupt with his crystal's power. Dubbing himself the Crystal of Kings, he unleashed a hellish army of monsters in an attempt to pillage the land's remaining crystals for himself. The just and elderly king of Estorea entrusted his country's crystal to his loyal knight, Cocco. He begs him to band together with the other kingdoms' warriors to destroy the evil tyrant.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Brezzasoft", "publishers": "Brezzasoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.86", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEvo23ZxxTs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/23045"}
