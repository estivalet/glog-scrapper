It was released by Atlus in Japan on August 8, 2009. In Senzo Kuyou, Atlus added some new characteristics like ability to dash in the air and perform \"Aerial Combos\" which have a similarity to those in the Marvel vs. Capcom series. Another new feature is that all the characters have \"Chain Combos\" that are performed by pressing the four buttons in order (A, B, C, D) and for first time in the series the \"Guard Break\" bar that fills when the character blocks an attack. Once the bar is full, the player will become vulnerable to an attack for a short time.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Noise Factory", "publishers": "Atlus", "genres": "", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106473"}
