{"name": "Doki Doki Idol Star Seeker", "overview": "Idol Star Seeker is a minesweeper-style arcade game played on a field of hexagonal tiles. The objective is to mark all of the mines and remove all of the tiles within the time limit to reveal an image of a scantily clad girl. Every stage features a new background image to reveal, but if the stage is not completed in a timely manner the image changes to that of the sulking fully clothed model but the player still has a chance to complete the stage and continue the game. However if the timer runs completely out, then it is game over.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "G.Rev", "publishers": "G.Rev", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/rxMO0VcCUy4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/136985"}
