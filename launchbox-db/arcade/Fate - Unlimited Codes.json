{"name": "Fate: Unlimited Codes", "overview": "Fate/unlimited codes is a fighting game planned by Cavia, developed by Eighting, and published by Capcom. It was released in Japan for arcades on June 11, 2008.<br><br>As in other games of the genre, the game process of Fate/unlimited codes is built on a battle between two characters, using combinations of strikes to lower an opponent's health points to zero. A player conducts a series of battles up to two or three (depending on the value set by the player) one-on-one victories with computer opponents or with another player. The timing of individual rounds may be limited or unlimited, depending on the player's settings. Depending on the combinations used and the damage inflicted with their help during the round, points are used that are used to statistically calculate the success of the game in certain modes.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "June 11, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Eighting", "publishers": "Capcom", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/36171"}
