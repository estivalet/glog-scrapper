Shockwaves can also be earned by collecting the number of Stars indicated at the start of each heat. Armoured Drones are indestructable excepting the use of a Shockwave. Some tunnels are under constuction and slow you down considerably if you do not take the optimal path. The shoulders on outdoor portions of the track wear down your shields as well as slow you down.

The names of the previous players mark the end distance they achieved.<br><br>Your vehicle automatically accelerates; you turn the yoke left and right to steer.
