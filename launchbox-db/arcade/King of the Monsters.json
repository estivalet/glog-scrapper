{"name": "King of the Monsters", "overview": "Players get to choose any one of six monsters (four in the 16-bit ports) for battle, and two players can join forces to fight the monsters together. Battles end when one of the monsters is pinned for a three count or if time expires (in which case the player loses).<br>The game consists of 12 total levels: the player first must defeat all six monsters, with the last monster being oneself, but in a different palette. Then the player must defeat the six monsters again, in the same order, but this time in different cities.<br>Mega criticised the game, awarding it a score of 10%, with Andy Dyer making the comment \"unforgivably bad. There should be laws to protect us from crud like this\".", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "July 1, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "SNK", "publishers": "SNK", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.21", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpkyLJsiHSw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/8346"}
