{"name": "Space Demon", "overview": "Space Demon is the result of Nintendo giving a license of their game Space Firebird to Fortrek. Nintendo, however, changed the game. Instead of giant birds, a larger spacecraft fights the titular Space Demon and his satanic minions. It retains most gameplay features. Move the ship from left to right to dodge enemy fire, and shoot down the demonic forces. You can use the Warp Shield once every mission to move forward and mow down your enemies.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/38998"}
