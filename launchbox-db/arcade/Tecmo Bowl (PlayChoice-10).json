{"name": "Tecmo Bowl (PlayChoice-10)", "overview": "Tecmo Bowl pits the player vs. the computer in 11 game single-elimination playoff action, or you can go head-to-head with a human opponent in action or coach mode. There are 12 teams of real NFL players (circa 1988) to choose from, but don't look for official NFL team logos or mascots like Bears or Dolphins--Tecmo Bowl has the NFLPA but not the NFL license.<br><br>The play perspective is top-down and the screen scrolls horizontally. Player graphics are large and colorful, which is made possible by limiting the number of players to nine per team. Animated cut-scenes are shown following touchdowns and at half-time, and crowds are shown filling the endzone seats.<br><br>PlayChoice-10 is an arcade machine that can consist of as many as 10 different games previously available only on the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) home console. The games for this system are in the modular form of circuit boards that are plugged into one of the ten open slots on the PlayChoice-10's motherboard.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tecmo", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/ZZnivYQMjPM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/158152"}
