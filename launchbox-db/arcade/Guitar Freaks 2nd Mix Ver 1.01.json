Score well enough and you may select another song to play.<br><br>Pick up your axe (guitar) off the rack, select a song, and follow along with the on-screen notes using the guitar controller's three buttons, and 'switch'. as the notes reach the top of the screen, hold down the corresponding button (red, green, or blue) and flick the switch on the body of the guitar, which simulates the guitar strings. Sometimes a guitar icon will come up the screen, and when it reaches the top, raising the guitar's neck vertically will give you a 'wailing bonus' Performing well enough will allow you to play an additional song.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bemani", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Music", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.1", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nblSPJBCK3s", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/36592"}
