{"name": "Metal Black", "overview": "Metal Black is a 1991 arcade shoot 'em up released by Taito in 1991.<br><br>In typical shooting game manner, Metal Black uses a two button setup, with one being used for standard shots, and the onther one for beam attacks. Both attacks can be powered up by collecting Newalone, which floats around freely in stages. The beam weapon becomes a screen covering burst attack when the maximum amount of Newalone has been collected. The Burst can be refocused to a beam by holding down the beam button.<br><br>Bosses also use beam attacks, and one can duel with the bosses by countering with a beam attack. The outcome of these duels depends on the accumulated Newalone.<br><br>Two special stages exist where one has to lock onto enemies in a pseudo 3D space and fire missiles. The random nature of these stages, combined with the fact that score largely depends on fast lockons, has been the target of criticism.<br><br>An alternative ending can be viewed by dying and not continuing on the last stage.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Taito", "publishers": "Taito", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.85", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJsYML2FGHY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/37603"}
