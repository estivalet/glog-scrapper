{"name": "The Cliffhanger: Edward Randy", "overview": "A fast moving platform game in which the player controls the Indiana Jones-esque and unfortunately named 'Edward Randy'. The levels are an inventive mix of standard platform action and 3-D scrolling levels; the latter usually having the player driving a jeep and repelling the enemy attacks. The game is based on the archetypal Hollywood action blockbuster and features a filmic score to back up the on-screen action. The player's only weapon is a whip - another nod to the Indiana Jones character - which can be used to both attack enemies and as a 'rope', to enable the player to reach distant platforms.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "February 1, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Data East", "publishers": "Data East", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.71", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGUbqTGUxA4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/39554"}
