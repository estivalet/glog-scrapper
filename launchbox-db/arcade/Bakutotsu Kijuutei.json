{"name": "Bakutotsu Kijuutei", "overview": "Bakutotsu Kijuutei (\u7206\u7a81\u6a5f\u9283\u8247?) is a scrolling shooter arcade game that was released by Namco in 1988 only in Japan. It runs on Namco System 1 hardware and is the sequel to Baraduke, which was released 3 years earlier. The player controls a spaceman in a bio-suit fighting strange-looking Octy and saving the one-eyed Paccets. The Paccets that the player collects during each round are added to the score at the end of the round instead of being in the bonus round, which only happens before a boss round. If a Paccet is accidentally shot or killed by an enemy, he will explode and send his eyeball flying. If the player catches the eyeball he will get a single point.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Namco", "publishers": "Namco", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5nue-DsJWs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/35042"}
