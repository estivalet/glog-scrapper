The game features excellent sound and graphics, spring-loaded joysticks for batting and pitching and extra base and go back buttons. High score lists the best batting average and ERA.<br><br>Several features that one would expect to find in a baseball game are not available: Base stealing (and all that goes with base stealing, such as pickoffs, balks, etc.), wild pitches/passed balls, fielding errors, hit batsmen, and bunting.
