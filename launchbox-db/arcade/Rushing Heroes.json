{"name": "Rushing Heroes", "overview": "A modern and realistic 3-D football simulator with attractive graphics and sound. Select from a large selection of teams with various levels of four abilities: passing, running, blocking, tackling. The game has excellent graphics and very good speech from the announcer who commentates on the gameplay. There are a large number of running and passing plays to select from, including a kick/punt. The quarterback can pick from several players to throw to. There are numerous defensive plays in the categories of passing, running, and blitz. This game certainly breaks the genre of the poorly designed sports game.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.7", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkSBm-9v8UQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/38659"}
