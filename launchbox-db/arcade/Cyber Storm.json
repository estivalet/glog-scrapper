{"name": "Cyber Storm", "overview": "Here is another Atari prototype that never made it to market. This is a fighting game with cool robot characters. The PCB is of a type that I have never seen before this hardware was rumored to have cost over $1,000,000 to design. No games were every released on this type of hardware. Another prototype called 'Bounty Hunter' also runs on similar hardware. This is supposed to be one of three dedicated units that exist. I know of one other boardset, but I have not been able to locate any of the other dedicated units. The other board may have come out of a dedicated unit that was converted to something else.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Atari Games", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.88", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/95896"}
