{"name": "Gondomania", "overview": "Fly a craft over a scrolling background and dodge enemy fire while shooting enemies. The theme is somewhat medieval (dragons, soldiers, etc.) and plant-like (vines, lakes, etc.). Two fire buttons shoot weapons which when powered-up have a limited number of shots.<br><br>Two fire buttons allow for a weak weapon and a strong weapon, both of which may be replaced by picking up power-ups that appear when enemies die. Each power-up is a different kind of weapon which has a limited use as indicated next to the weapon icon (\"10\" would mean 10 shots left). When a power-up is acquired, it replaces the weakest weapon you currently have. When a weapon is used up, it converts back into the original single-shot weapon (infinite shots). Makes a great and wretched sound when you die. The rotary aims your arm for the throwing weapon (daggers, axes, etc.). The M-1 is mounted on your craft and only fires forward.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nihon Bussan/AV Japan", "publishers": "Data East", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "2.72", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4VUyQD8FFQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/36514"}
