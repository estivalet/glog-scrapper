{"name": "Guitar Freaks 5th Mix", "overview": "A music simulation game where you play a large plastic guitar. Select a song, and try to play along as best as possible. Score well enough and you may select another song to play.<br><br>Just like in the other \"Bemani\" games, you follow along with the on-screen notes using the guitar controller's three buttons, and 'switch'. as the notes reach the top of the screen, hold down the corresponding button (red, green, or blue) and flick the switch on the body of the guitar, which simulates the guitar strings. Sometimes a guitar icon will come up the screen, and when it reaches the top, raising the guitar's neck vertically will give you a 'wailing bonus' Performing well enough will allow you to play an additional song.<br>Or, if so desired, you can participate in a 'session mode.' Guitar Freaks 5th Mix is compatible with Konami's 'multi-session base' which allows Guitar Freaks 5th Mix to be linked up with Keyboardmania 3rd Mix, and Drummania 4th Mix for 5 players playing at once! (2 on Keyboardmania 3rd Mix, two on Guitar Freaks 5th Mix, and one on Drummania 4th Mix.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bemani", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Music", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/36596"}
