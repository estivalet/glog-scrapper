It is the second game in the Initial D Arcade Stage series.<br>The opening starts with a shot of Irohazaka. As the song begins to play, it begins to feature Takumi's AE86 driving through the pass. It later cuts through a re-enactment of different battles from the series such as Keisuke's race with Kyoko, Takumi's race with Sakamoto, as well as Takumi's race with Kai Kogashiwa. It finally cuts through Takumi's race with Kyoichi Sudo, with the former beating him at the end of the 3rd bridge.<br>During the opening sequence, Keisuke's race with Kyoko and Takumi's race with Sakamoto take place in Irohazaka. This is likely because neither Sadamine or Maze Pass appear in the game.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "2002", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.32", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/36861"}
