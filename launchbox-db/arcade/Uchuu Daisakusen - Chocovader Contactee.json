Uch\u016b Daisakusen Chokob\u0113d\u0101: Kontakut\u012b) is a minigame arcade game that was released by Namco in 2002 only in Japan; it runs on that company's System 10 hardware, and showcases twenty-four minigames in five categories which both players have to use an 8-way joystick and a single button to take part in. The categories are Timing (in which the players have to press their buttons at a specific time), Shik\u014d (in which the players must select the right answer from several choices), Renda (in which the players have to repeatedly press their buttons, and one of the games in this category is like a role reversal of the \"Cattle Mutilation\" stages in Taito Corporation's Majestic Twelve), Technical (in which the players must collect certain objects while avoiding other ones) and 2-Ri Sen'y\u014d (in which the players have to compete against each other to select the correct answer first, and as the name implies, the games in this category can't be played alone) - and much like in Panicuru Panekuru, the players also receive a password after a run is over, which could be entered on Namco's website to play a unique web game until September 30, 2003. Furthermore, when this game's follow-up Uchuu Daisakusen Chocovader: Uchuu Kara no Shinryakusha (which was an isometric role-playing game) got released on the Game Boy Advance later in 2002, it had a link-up feature for players whose local arcades owned a cabinet.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "2002", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/39874"}
