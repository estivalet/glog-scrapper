{"name": "Air Inferno", "overview": "A helicopter rescue simulation with polygon-based graphics.<br><br>The pilot will have to fly his helicopter through different missions, playing firemen by dropping water on burning houses and landing to rescue people. Missions include landing on ships, houses, skycrapers and flying through sandstorms.<br>In the first mission, you fly the chopper to a burning skyscraper. A voice will cry out, \"Operate the fire extinguisher NOW!\" and you point toward the flaming window and press the extinguisher. Then with the fire out, you fly and land on the building to pick up survivors. Later missions include flying in the desert to rescue lost persons, but hazardous tornadoes can quickly bring you grief.<br><br>The graphics are polygon-based and were quite good considering the time when the game was released. The complex steering made it quite a challenge to fly, even though it is not realistic.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Taito", "publishers": "Taito", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.36", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GqiMgpFtU0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/7587"}
