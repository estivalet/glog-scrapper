{"name": "Operation Wolf", "overview": "The object of the game is to rescue the five hostages in the concentration camp. The game is divided into six stages: Communication Setup, Jungle, Village, Powder Magazine, Concentration Camp, and Airport. Completion of each stage advances the story. For example, upon completing the Jungle stage, an enemy leader is interrogated and the location of the enemy's concentration camp is found. This was one of the first shooter games to feature a storyline, and it had some similarities to real special operations missions.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Taito", "publishers": "Taito", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.16", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ujgy2ziBF8w", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6112"}
