{"name": "Pit & Run: F-1 Race", "overview": "A one or two player racing game published and developed by Taito in 1984.  The player must use a 4-way joystick, to take control of a race car which competes against nine other CPU-controlled cars.  As it travels the tracks, the player's race car fuel meter will decrease requiring refueling at \"GVS\" stations.  As in Taito's own Speed Race series, there are \"slip zones\" on the tracks, which require careful steering in; each track also has three trials.  On the second and third trials of each track, the player receives a \"Turbo\" tune-up when pulling into a \"GVS\" station for a refuel.  However, the turbo boost causes the fuel meter to decrease twice as fast. Once a player has mastered all four of the tracks regardless of how many trials it has taken, the player will be proclaimed \"CHAMPION\" and the game will end.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Taito", "publishers": "Taito", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.28", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/38140"}
