{"name": "Skydiver", "overview": "The object of the game is to guide a skydiver from a travelling plane to a like-colored ground target. The player must watch the wind speed and direction and judge the target position, plane speed, and duration of freefall before pulling the rip cord. After that, the player must guide the skydiver onto the target by moving the rip cord control either left or right.<br><br>The skydiver jumps from the plane whenever the player pushed the Jump button. The skydiver's parachute is opened when the rip cord is pulled. The rip cord control can be moved either left or right to help guide the diver on to the correct landing pad. Points are scored for successfully landing on the target. The target point score is determined by the lenghth of freefall -- the longer the fall, the larger the point score. A double bonus score is awarded for spelling \"SKYDIVER\".", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "June 1, 1978", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atari", "publishers": "Atari", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "2.65", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASfF_9smG8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/38912"}
