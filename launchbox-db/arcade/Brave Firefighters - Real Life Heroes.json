{"name": "Brave Firefighters: Real Life Heroes", "overview": "An electrical fault has caused the WhiteHead Hotel to go up in flames, trapping Mayor Taylor and his family inside. The object of the game is to extinguish the fires and progress through the building in order to rescue the mayor.<br><br>Fires may be extinguished by pushing the \"drainage\" button on the hose controller to release a stream of water. Continuous use of this button depletes the player's Water Gauge and decreases the distance and power of the water stream. The \"nozzle\" of the hose can also be twisted to create a powerful fog stream that can be used to extinguish nearby fires and flying sparks, as well as to move or destroy obstacles in the player's path. The player is under a time limit for each stage, but extra seconds are added to the timer if fires are extinguished quickly. When the timer runs out, the game ends.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega AM1", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.68", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuhx5clJ2sQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/35280"}
