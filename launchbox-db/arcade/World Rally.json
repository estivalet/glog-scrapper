As each race progresses the arrow gets longer with more bends on it. A warning arrow can also appear showing any obstacles ahead ranging from logs, trucks and bridges. On top of the screen there is a bar which shows your time. If the bar is green then you are on course to finish under 60 seconds. If any part turns red then you are on course to finish over 60 seconds.
