{"name": "JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Heritage for the Future", "overview": "JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Heritage for the Future is an updated version, released in 1999, of the JoJo's Bizarre Adventure arcade game. This is a fighting game developed by Capcom based on Hirohiko Araki's Japanese manga of the same title. The game was developed by the same team who are responsible for the Street Fighter III series.<br><br>The game combines Capcom's trademark anime-inspired graphics, as seen in the Darkstalkers series, with the colorful characters and events of Hirohiko Araki's creation, resulting in a highly stylized and detailed visual style. It also features many of the gameplay mechanics seen on previous Capcom fighting games, such as the use of power gauges for super moves, as well as a brand new Stand Mode, consisting of a guardian spirit that accompanies each character and can be summoned or dismissed at will by the player, resulting in variations on the character's move list and abilities.<br><br>Original author Hirohiko Araki served as a consultant for the game and created exclusive pieces of artwork for its promotion and packaging; most notably, he developed from scratch a new character design for Midler, since Capcom was interested in using her in the game and she had been only vaguely shown in the original manga.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "September 13, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Capcom Co., Ltd.", "publishers": "CAPCOM Co., Ltd.", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.03", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LbJkwP4w3M", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/32138"}
