{"name": "Acrobatic Dog-Fight", "overview": "A colorful horizontal-scrolling air battle game from Technos.<br><br>Acrobatic Dog-Fight, released in Japan as Dog-Fight, is a side-scrolling shooter arcade game released by Technos in 1984, featuring \"cute\" cartoon graphics and gameplay similar to the 8-way scrolling of Time Pilot but differs from that game in many respects. In Acrobatic Dog-Fight the playing field was limited with a ceiling and ground as well as an ultimate destination to navigate to. Acrobatic Dog-Fight also added two buttons, a secondary weapon and an eject button. Eject could be used at any time and made it possible to hijack enemy planes and continue flying them. If the pilot failed to hijack an enemy plane he would parachute to the ground where a standard plane waited nearby.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Technos", "publishers": "Data East USA, Inc.", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzvgXo-zcEA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/34892"}
