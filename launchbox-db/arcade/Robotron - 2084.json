Your job is simple: save humanity from their own creation -- the ROBOTRONS! The gameplay is pretty unique for the time. You can move and fire in any of eight directions. You get thrown in a room with various evil baddies strewn about, you've got to kill all the robots while at the same time finding some way to grab humans and avoid death.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "December 1, 1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Vid Kidz", "publishers": "Williams", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l800GL6NQPY&spfreload=10", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/31159"}
