There is a limited time to traverse through the level and save the princess. Igmo can shoot in one out of eight directions. To cross a river, the player must shoot Bergs in positions that form a bridge. In the middle of the level, the player must watch out for Octoids, Spidoids and Crustoids as well as the Bouncers that form boundaries. When fighting Sintar, his fiery projectiles must be avoided and the dragon must be shot multiple times to be defeated. When the princess is rescued, the player will progress to a more difficult level.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Magic Conversations", "publishers": "Epos Corporation", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.6", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgjREi_5PQQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/36835"}
