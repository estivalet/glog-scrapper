The ship's protective shield decreases with each collision. The ship has a limited quantity of energy; when this energy is fully depleted, the game is over. The game has only a single type of power-up, which increases the number of missiles a player may shoot in a single volley.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.34", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeJyQcDSX0o", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/36324"}
