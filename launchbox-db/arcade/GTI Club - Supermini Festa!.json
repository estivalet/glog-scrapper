{"name": "GTI Club: Supermini Festa!", "overview": "GTI Club Supermini Festa! twin marks the return of a classic racing arcade game machine series. Like the original, players race small cars including the Mini Cooper. There are also a range of minigames for up to 4 players.<br><br>Rather than focusing on sports cars and high speed, in GTI Club Supermini Festa! it is more about using your driving skills and handbrake to navigate through tough tracks. Like the original GTI Club, players must find shortcuts and alternative routes to get through the course as quickly as possible to beat their rivals.<br><br>Race types include \"Battle Race\" and \"Variety Battle\". Variety battle allows up to four players to face off against one another in driving based minigames. In 'Tag' mode, one player is randomly selected at the beginning of the course to carry a bomb on top of their car. The player with the bomb must ram into other cars to 'tag' them and offload the bomb. A timer counts down during play, and when the timer reaches zero the bomb explodes and that player is eliminated.<br><br>Another minigame type is the Soccer mode, where players use their cars to hit a giant soccer ball into the goal. Once the timer reaches zero, the player with the highest score is the winner.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "December 3, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.14", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106380"}
