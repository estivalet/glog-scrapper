{"name": "Super Buster Bros.", "overview": "The world has come under attack, and it is up to you as a Super Buster Brother to ensure that the world is cleared of all bouncing bubbles. Every time you shoot a bubble, it breaks into two smaller ones. But be careful! If a bubble touches you, you're history! Whether you play in the Panic Mode or the Tour Mode, the challenges will keep you on your toes! In the Panic Mode, bubbles large and small pour down for 99 levels of exhilaration. In the Tour Mode, you will travel the world in search of new and explosive bubble bottles. Enjoy the action, but be alert! As you progress through the levels, the game becomes more exciting as the bubbles bounce faster and faster.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "September 19, 1990", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Capcom", "publishers": "", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.27", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrimL7oJxko", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27117"}
