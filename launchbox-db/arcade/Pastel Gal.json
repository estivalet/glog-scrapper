{"name": "Pastel Gal", "overview": "Pastel Gal was produced by Nichibutsu in 1985.<br><br> Pastel Gal doesn\u2019t have much of a story, but it\u2019s there. The attract mode shows three women doing something called The Bubble Dance over and over again before tearing off their dresses and revealing swimsuits underneath. It\u2019s actually a pretty funny animation and is very entertaining if you\u2019ve been up all night because you can\u2019t sleep because of that dream again, but that\u2019s another story. Seeing dancers perform The Bubble Dance in less than 32 colors with a low animation count just looks cheesy and silly.<br><br>There are some women to choose from. They don\u2019t have personalities or anything. They only exist as clothed bodies you can disrobe with your mahjong skills.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/38061"}
