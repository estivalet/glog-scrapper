{"name": "Mouja", "overview": "Mouja is like a version of Money Puzzle Exchanger without the Magical Drop plagiarism: rather than Magical Drop's idiosyncratic \"pulling orbs down and thrusting them back up\" mechanic that MPE stole, Mouja has a more traditional \"orbs fall into a pit from above in pairs\". Otherwise, it has all the arithmatical fun seen in FACE's allegedly ill-fated game. In fact, the \"one\" coins look exactly the same, too, but it's a pretty simple design anyway, and the other coins all look different enough.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Etona", "publishers": "Etona", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/37735"}
