{"name": "Trouble Witches AC", "overview": "Trouble Witches AC is a series of doujin Bullet Hell Cute 'em Up games by Studio SiestA. The game allows players to, with magic, slow down bullets within a restricted area, and then convert the slowed bullets to score-boosting coins by killing the enemies that fired them. The game features 8 different characters available from the start to the player with 2 unlockable characters. Their stories are separated from each other but the same levels are used for every character. The difference between the characters is how they fire their projectiles; some characters are more focused at targeting bigger areas rather than single enemies while other characters use fewer attacks which are more powerful.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "2008", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.39", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/39826"}
