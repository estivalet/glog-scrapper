{"name": "Lock-On", "overview": "Lock-On is a 1986 first-person shooter and combat flight simulator video game with a futuristic theme. It is developed by Tatsumi and licensed to Data East for US distribution. Its graphics feature scaling sprites and a full-screen rotation effect. The game consists of 20 levels. Gameplay is similar to After Burner, i.e., the plane follows a predefined path, but the player can steer it slightly to evade incoming missiles. The player can fire guns and homing missiles, the latter of which requires the eponymous lock-on first.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tatsumi", "publishers": "Data East", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdjcZ6FbDr0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/37205"}
