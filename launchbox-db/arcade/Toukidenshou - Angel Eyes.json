{"name": "Toukidenshou: Angel Eyes", "overview": "Touki Denshou: Angel Eyes is an all-girl fighting arcade game, released by Tecmo in 1996. As Tecmo's first arcade fighting game, it suffers from severe balance issues where a single combo can completely drain a character's health. Since the game features a significant amount of aerial combat and unblockable juggle combos, a match will often be determined by which player strikes first.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tecmo", "publishers": "Tecmo", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.97", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/QxfdKC5-GpI?t=3", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/39759"}
