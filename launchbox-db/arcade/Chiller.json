{"name": "Chiller", "overview": "Shooting game with horror/torture motif. Player uses the mounted gun to try and hit a specified number of targets within a given time limit. There are four basic scenes, plus two types of \"bonus\" levels.<br><br>The game's four basic screens are a vice/guillotine room (or torture chamber), rack room (with a river of blood), haunted house hallway, and graveyard. Between each level there is a slot-machine bonus screen, where one tries to match up 3 identical characters by shooting the fast-moving scrollers. If all of the levels are completed successfully, a target-practice bonus round ensues, wherein one tries to shoot various objects (decapitated heads, etc) that move at increasingly faster rates.<br><br>Inaccurate shooting is punished by a faster rate of time decay. The game is generally considered quite gory, perhaps not by Mortal Kombat standards, but certainly for its time. The player is supposed to shoot apart people's body parts (exposing bones and blood, and resulting in realistic-sounding shrieks of horror). Various special situations are created as well. For example, shooting the edge of torture racks, to pull human targets apart into two pieces, or shooting the handle of a guillotine in order to drop the blade across someone's neck.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "January 1, 1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Exidy", "publishers": "Exidy", "genres": "Horror", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.16", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvvTh3cU8Ms", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/31956"}
