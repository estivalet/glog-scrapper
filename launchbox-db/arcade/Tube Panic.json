{"name": "Tube Panic", "overview": "Tube Panic was developed by Fujitek and published by Nichibutsu in 1984.<br><br>Tube Panic takes the player into a strange futuristic 3-D world, where space battles are fought inside huge, geometrical arenas swarming with mechanical hordes. Equipped with a beam cannon to shoot its way through the waves of enemy battle groups, the player's ship moves continuously forward along the structures' walls, with the camera behind; the view shifts and rotates along with the ship.<br><br>Travel can be sped up or slowed down, but the ship's power drains at a constant rate - losing it completely will disable your guns. Power can only be recharged by successfully docking with the mothership at the end of each mission, which also awards a score bonus. In the game world's many tubular sections you will encounter indestructible roadblocks, armored mini-bosses, and the occasional \"warp holes\" (which safely transport your ship some distance ahead).", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Fujitek", "publishers": "Nichibutsu", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXToj2BlNGU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/39834"}
