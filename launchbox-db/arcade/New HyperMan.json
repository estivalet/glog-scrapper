{"name": "New HyperMan", "overview": "New Hyper Man is a multi-directional shooter arcade game that was released by SemiCom in 1997 as part of XESS: The New Revolution (even though the title screen only reads Hyper Man, which is what 1995's Hyper Pac-Man had been renamed to for that compilation); as with the aforementioned \"Hyper Pac-Man\", it stars Namco's signature character, Pac-Man (but, much like that game, it is not officially part of the Pac-Man series). The players must utilise two 8-way joysticks to direct two Pac-Mans around ghost-regenerator- and pellet-free mazes (but if you let go of them, your Pac-Man will stop moving), along with two buttons to fix onto and spit lasers at the enemies (which are those two types of unnamed identikit ghosts from \"Hyper Pac-Man\", ducks, armadillos and slimes), as well as run - and there are a total of forty-five levels to get through (four of which happen to be boss ones).", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Semicom", "publishers": "Semicom", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKn2VaCEPmE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/37843"}
