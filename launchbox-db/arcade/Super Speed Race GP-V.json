{"name": "Super Speed Race GP-V", "overview": "Super Speed Race GP-V is a racing arcade game that was released by Taito Corporation in 1980; it is the sixth and penultimate title in their Speed Race series, and the only one that came in a sit-down cabinet (as opposed to an upright). The gameplay is very similar to that of its immediate predecessor Speed Race GP-5 (which was released earlier in 1980) given that several of the features which were introduced for that game reappear - water slicks on the track, your car having headlights that turn on when it is about to enter a tunnel, the track splitting into two paths when your car is on a bridge (and forcing you to make a decision quickly), and \"emergency cars\" with flashing lights on their roofs that must be avoided like any other CPU-controlled car. It was the last \"SR\" title to use discrete circuitry.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.92", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/39574"}
