The player picks one of three different ships - red, green or blue - each with their own pilot, fire pattern and laser web. Each ship has a standard gun and a bomb, but the most distinctive of these aspects is the laser-web: holding down the button for the standard gun will release a lock-on laser-web traditionally shaped as a cone or semicircle, which will destroy the enemies it locks onto after releasing the buttons.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Raizing", "publishers": "Raizing", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.13", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/nfEH7btgSoM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/38980"}
