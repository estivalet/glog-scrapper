{"name": "Initial D Arcade Stage Zero", "overview": "Released for the Sega Nu2 arcade system board on October 9, 2018. Unlike its predecessors, this game now uses a 6-speed gear shifter (similar to the ones found in the Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune games) as opposed to the sequential ones. The character designs are taken from New Initial D the Movie with entirely new BGMs that are rock songs from the films such as Backdraft Smiths, Clutcho, The Hug Me, The Valves, and Gekkou Green. A small number of Eurobeat songs from previous games are also featured but have to be unlocked. Also, the vehicles have been reduced by original ones featured in the last games, except for the Toyota 86, which was featured in the films. However, more vehicles were added through free updates later in the year.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "March 7, 2017", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/124295"}
