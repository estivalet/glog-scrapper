{"name": "Shinnyuushain Tooru-kun", "overview": "Konami chose not release Mike as is in Japan due to the game's premise of having a protagonist sneaking out of school after incidents of school violence at the time. As a result, an alternative version was produced for Japanese arcades titled Shinny\u016b Shain T\u014dru-kun (\u65b0\u5165\u793e\u54e1\u3068\u304a\u308b\u304f\u3093, \"Freshman Employee Toru\"), which replaces the school setting with a workplace. The classroom in the first level becomes an office and the teacher into a manager; the dance studio in the third level becomes the OL office; the other levels (the hallway, the gym, the restaurant and the outdoor garden) are mostly unchanged aside from a few graphical modifications, but the football players in the final level are instead security guards.<br><br>The game's soundtrack, which features chiptunes rendition of The Beatles songs \"A Hard Day's Night\", and \"Twist and Shout\", had permission granted by JASRAC in Japan, with a license displayed on the instruction card and printed circuit board.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/_KyttNek7pM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/38839"}
