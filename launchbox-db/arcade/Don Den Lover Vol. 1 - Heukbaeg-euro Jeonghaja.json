{"name": "Don Den Lover Vol. 1: Heukbaeg-euro Jeonghaja", "overview": "Don Den Lover is a computerized version of the game Othello (or Reversi) and like other computerized Othello (or Mahjong or some other games) games, it has a tendency to be pretty cheap...though you CAN win if you focus a bit. I'm not exactly a pro, but winning in this game isn't as hard as some say. You can get extra time if you are \"sweet\" to your opponent and place your piece in a glowing panel. Of course, this can help the CPU get the advantage. You also can use a \"special\" power to undo one move per match. The CPU can do this as well though.<br><br>The object of the game is to DRAW (both claim 32 pieces on the 8x8 board) or get more pieces than your opponent. You can choose to be the black (Kuro) piece and go first or the white (Shiro) piece and go second, which can help I suppose depending on your preference. You can claim pieces horizontally, vertically, and diagonally and you claim pieces by sandwiching pieces. Say you have a white piece (and you are white) and 3 black pieces vertically and an empty space at the end of the black pieces...if you place a white piece at the empty space, you will claim the 3 black pieces, creating all white pieces. It's easy enough to understand by watching the video.<br><br>The game has strip elements (strip mahjong is not the only kind of strip games out there) and victory gets the ladies (5 of them) to get down into limited clothing. I suppose if you want to play Othello with some quirks, this game has a nice arcade presentation. This is a good game to play.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dynax", "publishers": "Dynax", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZXY6uS3y0Y", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/35949"}
