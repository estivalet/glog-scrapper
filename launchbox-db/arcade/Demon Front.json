{"name": "Demon Front", "overview": "The gameplay is similar to Metal Slug and other run and gun games. It lacks the vehicles that were an element of Metal Slug.<br><br>In addition, there are some unique features in the game. Each of the four characters brings along a pet, which can be sent to attack enemies or used as a shield. There are three buttons: Shoot, jump, and shield. Holding the shoot button charges your pet, and when released the pet launches a stationary devastating attack for a few seconds. The shield button converts the pet into a shield that is permanent - until you press the button again or it takes enough damage to disappear. Melee attacks and pet attacks release hearts which boost your shield power.<br><br>Characters include Jake and Sara, two regular humans from Earth. Dr. J, a scientist, and Maya an ape. All characters largely play the same.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "2002", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "IGS", "publishers": "IGS", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.09", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQAcXk8FvTw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/32156"}
