{"name": "Super Thunder Blade", "overview": "This follow-up to Thunder Blade is very similar to the original arcade game. Get into a helicopter and blast away at the numerous enemies with its cannon and missiles. The game's four stages all follow a similar pattern: the first part is from a perspective behind the helicopter where players not only have to dodge enemy fire but also obstacles like buildings or caves. In between, players face off against one or two smaller boss enemies. When the first part of a level is finished, the view switches to an overhead perspective for the confrontation with the level's end boss.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/39372"}
