{"name": "Samurai Shodown V", "overview": "The most significant addition to the fighting system, is the \"defense\" button. This button\u2014depending on the position of the joystick\u2014allows the player to duck, quickly jump back, quickly jump forward or roll. This gives more tactical possibilities and balances the player with more evasive moves, rather than loading the buttons with attacks. Clearly, Yuki's strategy game experience was shown in the new fighting system. Brought back from the original two SS games, is the combination of the A and B buttons to create a fierce slash attack rather than having its own button, like the last two SS games. The C button is once again a kick.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "October 10, 2003", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Yuki Enterprise", "publishers": "SNK", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.21", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/26686"}
