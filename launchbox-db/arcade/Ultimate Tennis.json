{"name": "Ultimate Tennis", "overview": "Ultimate Tennis is a tennis game, it includes all four Grand Slam tournaments: Wimbledon, Flushing Meadows (US Open), Roland Garros (French Open) and Australian Open. There are six players to choose from, they all have a variety of characteristics and techniques. Two players can also play against each other, though doubles matches aren't available. One credit lasts for a number of lost points (the number of points is determined by a DIP switch setting). The game has a 3 button layout: hard, soft and lob shot. Pressing combinations of these buttons achieve advanced shots, such as top spin, slice, drop shot and super volley. There's also a replay feature accessible by pressing the start button to watch effective plays.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Art & Magic S.A.", "publishers": "Banpresto", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.62", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9OcVOpnIqo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/39881"}
