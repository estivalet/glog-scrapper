They become separated upon entering the castle, with Edward falling into a subterranean dungeon and having to fight his way out. Shortly after Edward and Charles reunite, Charles is fatally shot; however, an infection he has acquired mutates him into a hideous monster and Edward is forced to fight him in order to continue. Edward moves through the castle laboratory only to find Charles - mutated into a new form - waiting to battle him again at the exit.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "American Sammy", "publishers": "American Sammy", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.03", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUViySsUpZw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/33315"}
