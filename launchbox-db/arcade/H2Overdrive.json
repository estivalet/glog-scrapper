{"name": "H2Overdrive", "overview": "Players race using powerboats with various levels of difficulty against other boats, as well as seven other players on nearby cabinets. During the races, players can run into crates that give them power-ups that can range from speed boosts to MegaHull and HullCrusher abilities, which can be used to destroy opposing boats. On the cabinet, a throttle is used to move the boat, instead of pedals. On the throttle, a red button is used to boost the boat. Unlike in Hydro Thunder, boats can now perform stunts, as well as various acrobatic maneuvers.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "May 1, 2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Specular Interactive", "publishers": "Raw Thrills", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.42", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83MtvmbRkm4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/129996"}
