{"name": "Thunder Force AC", "overview": "Thunder Force AC was produced by Sega/Technosoft in 1990.<br><br>The gameplay is simple but challenging: shoot or be shot down. You start with TWIN SHOT and BACK SHOT, which can be selected during gameplay. By shooting down the power-up ship, you receive different power-ups. They are as follows:<br>Saber S: upgraded Twin Shot<br>Lancer L: upgraded Back Shot<br>Wave W: weak, wide shots that penetrates through walls<br>Firebomb? F: drops bombs that trail across ceilings and floors<br>Hunter H: three-way, fairly weak homing shots<br>Shield blue S: provides temporary damage protection<br>There are also two CRAW units mini-ships, which can be collected, that circle around your ship for extra firepower and provide some form of protection.<br><br>Thunder Force AC is a modified version of Thunder Force III made specifically for the arcades with reworked graphics - although still very close to what the Genesis was able to offer. Thunder Force AC puts you behind the cockpit of a lone starfighter out to destroy all the enemy forces of the Orn empire by clearing 8 enemy-infested stages set in various outer space locations. Most of the game levels are taken directly from the Genesis version with a few minor changes, though levels 4 and 5 are totally different - both in graphics and level design.<br><br>The game gives you a health-bar and the ability to swap collected weapons on the fly, which can be obtained by catching power-ups and activating them whenever you want.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Technosoft Co., Ltd.", "publishers": "Sega Enterprises Ltd.", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.27", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMeNx-UAe0U", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/39649"}
