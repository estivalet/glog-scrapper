{"name": "Hyper Crash", "overview": "Hyper Crash is a 3rd person perspective driving game where you have to drive along a course over various stages destroying as many cars as you can. As you drive along, a fuel gauge slowly decreases and if this empties then it is game over. To re-fuel your car you must destroy the other cars to keep it topped up. There are two ways to destroy them, either by repeatedly ramming a car until its damage meter fills or flip your car in the air to land on them. Flipping your car destroys the other cars in one go but this wastes fuel. As you progress other cars will flip in the air as well and if you are destroyed then it wastes fuel. Other obstacles to look out for are barrels which when hit destroys your car but you can ram other cars into them.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.1", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYNbuuH1pCA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/36812"}
