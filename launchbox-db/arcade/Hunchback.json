{"name": "Hunchback", "overview": "The game is set on a castle wall. The player must cross the screen from left to right avoiding obstacles in order to ring the bell at the far right. Obstacles include pits which must be swung over on a long rope, ramparts which must be jumped (some of which contain knights with spears) and flying fireballs and arrows (to be ducked or jumped). Eventually, after completing a number of screens, the player must rescue Esmeralda. If this final screen is completed, the game begins again at a faster speed. The game had several official ports to just about every 8-bit microcomputer during the 1980s, as well as a number of clones with various names.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Century Electronics", "publishers": "Century Electronics", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.47", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWSLCkGGgoU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/11857"}
