{"name": "Change Lanes", "overview": "Change Lanes is a racing arcade game which was released by Taito America Corporation in 1983.<br><br>The player must use a steering wheel and gear shifter to take control of an amphibious red car (with a single pedal, to make it accelerate). It can drive anywhere, on roads and in rivers, and can crash into CPU-controlled cars or scenery objects countless times; however, doing so consumes fuel and once the car runs out of fuel, the game is over.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Taito", "publishers": "Taito", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.14", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zeX9yvcgYo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/35500"}
