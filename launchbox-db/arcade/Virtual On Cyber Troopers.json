{"name": "Virtual On Cyber Troopers", "overview": "Cyber Troopers Virtual-On is an arcade action title that was released in 1995.<br>    In the Virtual-On universe, Virtuaroids became relatively easy to produce when the creation of matter through \"reverse conversion\", and the virtuaroids themselves, were discovered. They are produced by first constructing a working skeletal frame, then installing the \"V-connector\", and lastly creating their armor through reverse conversion. Later in the series, the V-converter would be responsible for the full creation of the Virtuaroid, including the skeletal frame.<br>    Virtual-On is set up similar to a Versus fighting game. Two Virtuaroids (Mecha) face each other on a stage. The player(s) use a variety of firearms, explosives, melee weapons, and other techniques to destroy the enemy for a set number of rounds, usually a single battle, or best two out of three rounds, like fighting games.<br>    The game is made to be played with a two-joystick setup, known as the twin-sticks. Each stick is equipped with a trigger and a button on top of the stick.<br>    The twin sticks control the virtuaroid on screen much like a bulldozer. Pushing or pulling both sticks in one direction will make it move in that direction, while pushing one stick forward and pulling the other back will make it turn in the forward direction. Pulling the sticks apart causes the virtuaroid to jump into the air, and automatically turn to face the opponent. Pulling them towards each other while pulling a trigger causes the virtuaroid to prone while firing.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Sega AM3", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106474"}
