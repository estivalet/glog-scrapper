{"name": "Super Speed Race V", "overview": "Super Speed Race V is a racing arcade game which was released by Taito Corporation in 1978; it is the fourth title in their Speed Race series, and the \"V\" stands for the game's five best scorers (shown on the LED displays to the left of the monitor, above the player score and timer). The player must yet again utilize a steering wheel and gear shifter, to take up control of a car, with a single pedal to make it accelerate - and this time, the gameplay will be extended at 3000 points, while the old \"Slip Zones\" from the first two \"SR\" games will appear on the track at 800 points and every 1000 points thereafter.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/38549"}
