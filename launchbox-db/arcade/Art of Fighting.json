{"name": "Art of Fighting", "overview": "In an attempt to capture some of the momentum of the popular 2D fighting genre, SNK's Art of Fighting retains the essence of such classics as Street Fighter II and Final Fight while adding additional features to gameplay. The game's story focuses on Ryo Sakazaki and Robert Garcia traveling to South Town to rescue Yuri from the clutches of gangsters. In two-player mode, you take on each other in battle by punching and kicking each other while attempting strong-arms. There is even a \"taunt\" button. Unique for fighting games of the early '90s, the characters are larger and more detailed in Art of Fighting, and a \"camera\" zooms in and out of the action depending on the distance between the fighters.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "September 24, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "SNK", "publishers": "SNK", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.74", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/34993"}
