{"name": "Suzuka 8 Hours", "overview": "Suzuka 8 Hours is an arcade game based on the famous 8 hour endurance motorbike race held on the Suzuka Circuit in Japan. Instead of racing for the full 8 hours you have to try to complete four laps against the clock on your own or against a friend. As the race is against the clock the other riders on the track are just there to overtake without crashing. Hitting another rider or an obstacle on the side of the track throws you off your bike and wastes precious seconds. The longer the race goes on the game slowly changes from racing in the day to racing at night.<br><br>Suzuka 8 Hours is viewed from a 3rd person perspective and you and a friend sit on replicas of bikes using handlebars to steer, accelerate and brake your bike.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Namco", "publishers": "Namco", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.19", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/RLtrBE72hVg?t=27", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/39407"}
