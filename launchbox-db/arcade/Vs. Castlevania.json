{"name": "Vs. Castlevania", "overview": "VS. Castlevania is an arcade port of the Nintendo Entertainment System version of Castlevania that was released for the VS. System hardware in 1987.<br><br>VS. Castlevania differs from the console version as the game's difficulty has been raised to make it more suitable for arcade play: the time limit is much stricter (e.g.: 170 seconds are given to clear Block 1 instead of 300), enemies do more damage and less bonus points are given at the end of each block (making extra lives much more scarce). The difficulty level, starting number of lives and bonus points awarded at the end of each \"block\" can be altered by adjusting the DIP switches on the actual board. Despite the addition of the word \"VS.\" to the title, the game can only be played by one player, although the PCB can be set up to run at two monitors at the same time when installed on a VS. DualSystem cabinet. The palette is also a bit different due to the video output of the VS.
