{"name": "Magical Spot II", "overview": "To put it in simple terms, if it moves and it is not your ship, destroy it. This game follows in the same vein as many of the early 1980's space shooters. This is essentially the same game as the original only slightly updated. Even the Cabinet doesn't have II written on it, just Magical Spot. Although the marquee is slightly different.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1980", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Universal Co., Ltd.", "publishers": "Universal Co., Ltd.", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.08", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHzcZX3Y6gA&t=11s", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/37322"}
