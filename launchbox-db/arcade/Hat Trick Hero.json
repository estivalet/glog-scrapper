The game scrolls horizontally at a slight angle, and recreates the coin-op's close-up zoom effect after a player scores. Only a small area of the pitch is on screen at a time, but there is a scanner to show the whole pitch.<br><br>Although the game has a referee, he often loses attention, and these moments give you a chance to foul, punch or side-swipe opposition players. One and two player options are included.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "March 27, 1992", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Taito Corporation", "publishers": "Taito Corporation", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/36693"}
