{"name": "Street Fighter II': Hyper Fighting", "overview": "Street Fighter II' - Hyper Fighting was produced by Capcom in 1992.<br><br>Hyper Fighting features faster playing speed compared to Champion Edition. As a result, the inputs for special moves and combos requires more precise timing. The faster playing speed also allowed players to get into battle quicker, as well as to react quicker. All of the fighters, with the exception of Guile and the four Shadaloo Bosses, were each given at least one new special move.<br><br>Each fighter also received a new default palette. The original palettes are now featured as alternate palettes for each character, replacing the ones that were in Champion Edition. The only character exempt to this change is M. Bison, who retains his original default palette, but still gets a different alternate palette.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "December 1, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Capcom Co., Ltd.", "publishers": "CAPCOM Co., Ltd.", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.58", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aAeZyqwEnA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78289"}
