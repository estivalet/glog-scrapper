{"name": "Virtua Golf", "overview": "Virtua Golf is a golf simulator for arcades that can be played by up to four players depending on the mode. The game is viewed from a third person perspective and is controlled with a trackball as well as four buttons. By rolling the trackball towards the player the power of the shot is adjusted and by rolling it towards the screen the shot is made. If the player keeps rolling the trackball immediately after the shoot it is possible to apply top spin or back spin. When adjusting the power of the shoot and indicator on the mini map shows how far the ball might travel although this is also affected by wind and undulation of the ground. The buttons are used for moving the golfer as well as controlling the camera.<br><br>The game features four game modes: stroke play, match play, skins game and 18-hole challenge. Stroke play is for one to four players who compete on all 18 holes with the aim of getting the highest score. Match play is for two players only who compete on all 18 holes with the aim of getting the most wins. If they have the same number of wins the match will go to sudden death. Skins game is for two to four players and is the prize mode. The player who gets the highest score on a hole is rewarded with a prize. The 18-hole challenge is an endurance mode and can only be played by one player who has to clear as many holes as possible.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/114523"}
