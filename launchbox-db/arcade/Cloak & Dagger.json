{"name": "Cloak & Dagger", "overview": "Cloak & Dagger is an arcade game released by Atari in 1983 The game is based on the film of the same name where it is critical to the plot. The game saw limited arcade release as a conversion kit for Robotron 2084 cabinets.<br>The Cloak & Dagger game screens from the movie are mostly from the arcade version, and not the Atari 5200 game console as it would appear in the film. Although a 5200 version of the game was planned, it was never released due to the video game crash of 1983 and eventual sale of Atari. Because the Atari 5200 version of Cloak & Dagger wasn't complete during filming, the cartridge props are actually other 5200 games with a Cloak & Dagger label stuck on them.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atari", "publishers": "Atari", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.29", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OryQRZ6Ez8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/11702"}
