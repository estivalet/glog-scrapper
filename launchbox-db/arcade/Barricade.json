{"name": "Barricade", "overview": "As with Gremlin's game Blockade, Ramtek's Barricade is an early example of a light cycle game for arcades. Barricade is intended for either two or four players. Each player controls an ever growing wall made up of individual small squares. These walls are growing on a fixed playfield of limited size, therefore room will eventually run out for these growing walls. So the goal of the game is to win a round by forcing the other players wall to collide into themselves or another barrier.<br><br>The operator of the arcade machine can set the number of rounds it takes to win (from one to seven) and set how fast or slow the speed at which the walls grow (there are seven different speed options).", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1976", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ramtek", "publishers": "Ramtek", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.11", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FVcancjfBM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/35069"}
