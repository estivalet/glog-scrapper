{"name": "Flyball", "overview": "Flyball is a baseball arcade game. Each player controls either the pitching team or the hitting team. Both pitching and batting are controlled via joystick. The pitching team has only one player on the field at a time (the pitcher), while the hitting team can have up to four, depending on what bases they're on. As in real baseball, the goal is to hit the ball and run the bases, and the team with the highest score after the innings run out wins. The game lasts one or two innings, depending on how the owner sets the machine up.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "July 1, 1976", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atari", "publishers": "Atari", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiC2rs9aM0U", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/36236"}
