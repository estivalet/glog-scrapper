{"name": "The Ninja Kids", "overview": "The Ninja Kids is a side-scrolling arcade Beat 'em Up made in 1990 by Taito. It received no ports until its inclusion in the Taito Legends Compilation Re-release in 2005. <br><br>The story is about an evil sect trying to summon \"The Satan\" on July 1999 (as foretold by Nostradamus), and only a group of four ninja can stop them.<br>Pretty standard fare for a videogame, except for the fact that almost every character is a puppet. No, not People Puppets, just regular puppets. Everything about this game is very tongue-in-cheek, though, so it also can be seen as a Stealth Parody of typical cheesy brawler storylines and settings.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Taito", "publishers": "Taito", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.41", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQ14oIPeO24", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/32262"}
