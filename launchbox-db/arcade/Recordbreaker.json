{"name": "Recordbreaker", "overview": "Recordbreaker is a multi-event sports game for one or two players, where the player tries to achieve a world-record score in each of ten competitions. The events include: 100m sprint, 4x100m relay, Triple jump, Pole vault, Long horse, 100m swimming, Weightlifting, Horizontal bar, 100m hurdles and Shot put. The events can be played in any order, although losing an event results in the end of the game.<br><br>Each of the ten events is controlled by buttons only. The 100m sprint involves repeated pressing of a single button as quickly as possible. The others events additionally require pressing another button to jump (hurdles), pass a baton (400m relay), resurface for oxygen (100m swimming) or to select the angle for throwing (shot-put) or dismounting (horizontal bar). These more complicated games have a \"demo\" mode to show how the game is played prior to the qualifying heat.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Taito", "publishers": "Taito", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.81", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqJyJQP0KwQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/38508"}
