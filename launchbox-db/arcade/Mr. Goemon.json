{"name": "Mr. Goemon", "overview": "Mr. Goemon is a side-scrolling platform arcade game developed by Konami in 1986, based on Ishikawa Goemon, an outlaw in 16th-century Japan.<br><br>Enemies charge and grab the character, ending his life unless the player jostles the control stick to break free. Later enemies also have projectile weapons that the player must dodge. They are defeated by throwing a found object at them or hitting them with an always-equipped pipe. Jumping on the enemies' heads will push them down a level or off the screen entirely. Levels feature either boss battles or a pile of gold bars at the end, worth various points depending on the level.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "May 1, 1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.56", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/37748"}
