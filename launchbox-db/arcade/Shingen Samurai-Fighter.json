{"name": "Shingen Samurai-Fighter", "overview": "The game play is simple, you have 2 attack buttons and 1 jump button. The 2 buttons have a right and left direction, meaning that you can't attack on the direction where you're going. The right button has a right attack button, and the left button has a left button. The jump button has automatically the attack instead of requiring to press to attack button while jumping. You can get power ups that spell \"Samurai*\".<br><br>The power ups that spell \"Samurai\" have the abilities in each piece are: \"Sa\" - Speeds up your player, \"Mu\" - Gives you a shield, \"Ra\" - Enchances your sword, and \"I*\" - more health. Getting all the pieces lets you have 2 sharp knifes that are projectiles, however, you lose this ability when the stage/section is cleared.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jaleco", "publishers": "Jaleco", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.65", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/38838"}
