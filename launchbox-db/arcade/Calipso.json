{"name": "Calipso", "overview": "Compete against each other and a time limit (your air supply) to retrieve a treasure on the sea floor.<br><br>You play a diver who is trying to get a treasure. Hold Fire and push in the direction you want to shoot, but you will be unable to move while doing this. Shoot the sea animals and the other player.
