{"name": "Gotcha", "overview": "Gotcha is a 1973 arcade game manufactured by Atari. It was Atari's fourth game after Pong, Space Race, and Pong Doubles. It is a two-player maze game where the objective is to catch the other player. A maze is displayed on the screen. The first player controls the Pursuer which is represented by a square and the second player controls the Pursued which is represented by a plus sign. As the Pursuer moves closer and closer to the Pursued, an electronic beep sound increases in frequency to a feverish pitch until the Pursuer catches the Pursued. Each time, the Pursuer catches the Pursued, a point is scored and the chase starts over again.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "October 11, 1973", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atari", "publishers": "Atari", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.88", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsVA7-NhcBE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/47360"}
