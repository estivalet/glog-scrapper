{"name": "Rampage (Adrenaline Amusements)", "overview": "The destruction began in 1986 when Midway released Rampage to arcades and subsequently home consoles. Then in 2018, the arcade classic became the most destructive film of 2018. Now you can enjoy the building smashing mutant excitement at the arcade once more with Adrenaline\u2019s RAMPAGE.<br><br>Combining elements from the recent film and the classic game makes for one of the most intense and exciting destructive experiences to land in arcades in modern times. Players can control one of three mutant monsters: George (the ape), Ralph (the wolf) or Lizzy (the reptile). The controls are simple: a joystick for movement, a button for smashing. The goal is to flatten the buildings as quickly as possible, moving on to the next section and avoiding getting hit by the firepower from the military. You earn points \u2013 and tickets \u2013 as you progress.
