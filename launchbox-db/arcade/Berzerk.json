{"name": "Berzerk", "overview": "You have been sent into a building infested with robots, and must do your best to clear it out. Each rooms has a number of walls through the middle, which restrict your movement. There will be a number of bad guys in the room - on early screens they may be immobile and not shoot at you, but after a few levels they become capable of shooting in multiple directions. You can shoot at them in 8 directions, but can't shoot diagonally while moving. There are gaps at the side of each room, through which you exit, before or after clearing the room (there is a bonus for clearance). You get an extra life every 2000 points.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "November 12, 1980", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Stern Electronics", "publishers": "Stern Electronics", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.76", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdewB64l2-c", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/33141"}
