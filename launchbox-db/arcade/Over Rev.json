{"name": "Over Rev", "overview": "Over REV is a 1997 racing game developed by Jaleco for Sega's Model 2 arcade board. It features four nicely rendered tracks across the Greater Tokyo Area. Although it has some serious issues with driving and collision physics, if you stick with the game long enough to overcome its intricacies, it can be pretty rewarding. Like Jaleco's other Model 2 racer, Super GT 24h, you'll want to use an automatic transmission.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "January 1, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Jaleco", "publishers": "Jaleco", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.73", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xovrUr9-TiM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/19067"}
