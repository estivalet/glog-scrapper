{"name": "Fire Power", "overview": "Fire Power! The most complete tank fighter ever to shoot down enemy aircraft. You are on the ground trying to avoid minefields placed in your path. If you are caught in a minefield, you lose your FIRE POWER and can't shoot at enemy aircraft...but only temporarily. Once the tank is out of the minefield, you can speed up using your control lever, and start shooting down planes again. The faster you speed, the better your FIRE POWER and your score.  ~From the original advertisement.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "November 1, 1975", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Allied Leisure Industries", "publishers": "", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/36217"}
