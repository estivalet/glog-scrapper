{"name": "Tri-Sports", "overview": "Tri-Sports is a compilation arcade game that was released by Bally Midway in 1989; it runs upon the company's MCR-68 hardware, but with the added Yamaha YM-2151 and HC-55516. The game's trackball controller functions differently for each of the three titles. It contains three games:<br><br>Power Strike: this is similar to Midway's own 4 Player Bowling Alley and features regulation, flash and triple strike modes.<br>Pool Shark: not to be confused with Atari's old Poolshark, it features straight pool, rotation, and nine-ball modes.<br>Mini Golf Deluxe: this is a sequel to the 1985 game Mini Golf.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/39805"}
