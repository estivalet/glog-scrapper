{"name": "Buttobi Striker", "overview": "Medal games (\u30e1\u30c0\u30eb\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0, medaru g\u0113mu) are a type of game commonly found in arcades and casinos, especially within Japan. In order to play a medal game, a customer must first exchange their cash into medals (metal coins, much like an arcade token). The rate of medals versus cash varies from arcade to arcade, but usually the cheapest range is from \u00a5300 all the way up to \u00a510,000. While many of the medal games simulate gambling, the medals cannot be traded back into cash, but only used to play more games, or exchanged (via paper tickets) for prizes.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Casino", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llyuAsOAwNM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/127928"}
