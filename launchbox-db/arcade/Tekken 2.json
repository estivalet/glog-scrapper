{"name": "Tekken 2", "overview": "The gameplay in Tekken 2 is much like its predecessor with a few additions. It continues to use 2D backgrounds in its stages, an infinite playing field, and a fighting system that utilises four buttons: left punch, right punch, left kick, and right kick. Distinct additions included attack reversals for some characters, back throws, chain-throws, and a sidestep unique to two characters, Kazuya Mishima and Heihachi Mishima; However, Yoshimitsu has a spinning sidestep move that lowers his health. Tackles were also modified to inflict damage when running from a greater distance.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Namco", "publishers": "Namco", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.26", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/S_7R4KQxdL8?t=51", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/28730"}
