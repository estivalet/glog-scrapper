{"name": "Rabbids & Ladders", "overview": "For centuries, the board game Snakes & Ladders has entertained generations of people. Now the concept is getting a 21st century makeover thanks to those goofy Rabbids with Rabbids & Ladders by Adrenaline Amusements.<br><br>Rabbids & Ladders is a simple concept that plays much like a board game, but with the dynamic advantages that are offered by the digital format. All players have to do is credit up, then spin the toilet paper roll controller (blame the Rabbids and their penchant for toilet humor for that one). The wheel on the screen will spin, and whichever number it lands on, that\u2019s how many spaces you move. You can land on one of four space styles \u2013 a ticket winning, with the number of tickets shown on the ground; a free spin space for another change; a toilet, which sends you to a lower level with a minor ticket reward; or the Bonus Wheel, where you get to spin again for a chance at big tickets! With four player stations, and a colorful, funny theme, players won\u2019t be able to stop playing!", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.12", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dUBu2xY4tqM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/33513"}
