You fight these creatures with your bubble gun that forms a bubble a round them and lifts them up. <br><br>The bubble will break after a while, and jumping them on the head will kill them permanently. A stage can be completed if you kick a soccer ball in a goal at the end of each stage. You can play solo or with a friend.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "SunA", "publishers": "SunA", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZHMZ2czRg4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/36683"}
