{"name": "Super Speed Race", "overview": "Super Speed Race is the successor to Racer. The game features sprites for cars in a top down view. The player's car is controlled with a steering wheel attached to the arcade cabinet, an accelerator and gear shift. The player's speed is shown on a separate speedometer rather than on-screen. The racing track scrolls, continues straight ahead, and features color scenery graphics on either side. The high scores of the best five players are stored and displayed on a separate LED display to the left of the screen.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "November 1, 1979", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Taito", "publishers": "Midway", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/39353"}
