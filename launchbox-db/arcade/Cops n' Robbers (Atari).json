{"name": "Cops n' Robbers (Atari)", "overview": "In Cops n' Robbers, 1 to 4 players play the parts of the police and criminals. The game always has either 2 or 4 players, and if there is an odd number of players, the computer controls the remaining players. Half the players control the cops, and the other half controls the robbers. The two sides are each on one side of the street in their car, shooting each other. Each side can move up and down their own lane. A beer truck moves up and down the center lane, which gets in the way of the shooters.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "July 1, 1976", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atari", "publishers": "Atari", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "2.57", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVslOHjhmjc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/35643"}
