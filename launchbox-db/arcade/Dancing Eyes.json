{"name": "Dancing Eyes", "overview": "Dancing Eyes (\u30c0\u30f3\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u30a2\u30a4, Danshinguai) is an arcade game developed by Namco and released in Japan in 1996. It was conceived and directed by Masateru Umeda, director of The Outfoxies. In the game you control small monkey-like creatures in puzzles similar to Amidar and QIX in what can be seen as a fusion of these games and erotic strip-mahjong games. The game could be considered a 3D version of the game Gals Panic. Unlike the two-dimensional grids in aforementioned games however, Dancing Eyes' puzzles take place across a three-dimensional model. These are primarily the clothes of women, but can include barrels, shower curtains or cages.<br><br>While the game's System 11 arcade board was based on PlayStation hardware, it did not see a console release.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Masateru Umeda", "publishers": "Namco", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.88", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFiCwZJ_slw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/35792"}
