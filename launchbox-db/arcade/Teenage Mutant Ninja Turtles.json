{"name": "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles", "overview": "Even though Splinter defeated Shredder and Casey Jones attempted to crush him in a garbage truck, Shredder's titanium helmet protected him from certain doom. He awoke on a garbage ship and floated back to land on a raft made out of styrofoam cups that were non-biodegradable. Once on land he began training stronger Foot Soldiers, but they alone were not enough. Shredder, using his translocation matrix beam, then travelled through the universe in search of stronger allies. He recruited a member of the Ultimate Galactic Sword residing in Sector Six of the Oead Star Zone and on the ice planet of Traglodoon he found a bounty hunter named Tora. Together, Shredder, his minions and his two new allies have worked together to kidnap April O'Neil. Splinter has taught them well and now it's up to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles to save her!", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "November 15, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.37", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0kKGOQOYxg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/8344"}
