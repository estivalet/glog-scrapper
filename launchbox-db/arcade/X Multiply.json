{"name": "X Multiply", "overview": "XMultiply  is a side-scrolling shooter published by Irem, and similar in style to their earlier R-Type. In 1998, the game was released with Image Fight as a one-disc doublebill on PlayStation and Sega Saturn.<br><br>The game itself is a side-scroller like R-Type, albeit with a short vertical-scrolling area towards the end of the sixth level. Instead of the Force pod, however, the main power-up apparatus takes the form of two flexible tentacles. The tentacles are invulnerable to all enemy attacks, and can be positioned with careful maneuvering of the X-002. Konami's Xexex is based on a fusion of this weaponry with the Force system of R-Type. In the PlayStation 2 game R-Type Final, the ship \"Cross The Rubicon\" uses the \"Flexible Force\", a Force based on XMultiply with roughly the same attacks.<br><br>The game centers around an unusual alien invasion against a colony planet in the year 2249\u2014the aliens themselves are microscopic creatures that invade, infect, and kill the colonists. Scientists have deployed the microscopic fighter X-002 into the body of the hapless woman whose body has been invaded by the alien queen.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Irem", "publishers": "Irem", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.79", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y90scpNW7o", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40227"}
