{"name": "XX Mission", "overview": "In an ultra classic style reminiscent of Xevious, XX Mission is a vertical shmup to the slow pace. <br>At the controls of a jet, one confronts enemies on the ground (tanks + turrets) or in the air (helicopter + airplane), using the respective shots. <br>The graphics are sober and rather monotonous, one passes from the forest to the sea and vice versa, as in Xevious. The music is not bad, the sound effects are roots. <br>The gameplay is correct, the game is initially boring (the first level is very slow) to get stronger afterwards, the enemies having quite unpredictable displacements, way \"flight of drunken gnats\". <br>Not really innovation compared to the norm but a correct realization, to reserve for fans of the old school genre.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "UPL", "publishers": "UPL", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IouV4Tw3aPU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/12422"}
