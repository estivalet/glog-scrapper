The original arcade game version used an unusual screen setup that situated one display in between projected images of two other displays, creating the appearance of a triple-wide screen. Versions of the game were subsequently released for a variety of home platforms, including various personal computers, and were mostly well received. A remake known as The Ninja Warriors Again was developed by Natsume and released for the SNES in 1994.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "January 1, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Taito", "publishers": "Taito", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.62", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRgcK5uBc_0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/31996"}
