Eight combatants come to this turney to find out who is the best of the best in the world. Like in many Korean fighting games at the time, there is no boss, nor any hidden characters. Each character has its own stage, but the same musical tunes are played in each of them. Get ready to fight to the rythm of Lambada and celebrate your victory with the Ode to Joy.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "May 1, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "SunA", "publishers": "SunA", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.32", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VejTF27dcp4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27162"}
