{"name": "B.Rap Boys", "overview": "In 1992, a sequel to DJ Boy, B.Rap Boys was produced contaning similar designs and content. The game features three player simultaneous action using characters that are different from one another (rather than palette swaps), and the optional use of weapons and vehicles, as well as a more robust fighting system. The game's soundtrack was notable for having extensively sampled studio recordings from hip-hop group 3 Stories High.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kaneko", "publishers": "Kaneko \\ Sammy", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "3", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.78", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2Qt21lStXU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/35031"}
