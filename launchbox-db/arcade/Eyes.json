{"name": "Eyes", "overview": "The player controls a hat-wearing eyeball in a maze. As in Pac-Man the goal is to collect all of the dots to advance to next level, but in Eyes you shoot the dots rather than eat them. Computer-controlled eyes chase and shoot at the player. Shooting a computer eye gives points and removes it from the level, but it will reappear a short time later. Being shot by a computer eye is fatal.<br><br>As the game progresses, more computer eyes are added to levels and they take less time to shoot at the player. They also move faster.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Rock-Ola", "publishers": "Rock-Ola", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.74", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5Vlm-vvUTc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/29042"}
