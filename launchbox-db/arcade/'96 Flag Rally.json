{"name": "'96 Flag Rally", "overview": "'96 Flag Rally is a top-down racing game set in maze-like environments similar to the concept of New Rally-X (although with more \"modern\" cartoonish graphics). The player chooses between different girls and a selection of cars or motorcycles. Set across multiple stages the player rides or drives around to collect flags while avoiding hazards and opponents Pac-Man style. When crashing a life is lost immediately.<br><br>A map on the right side of the screen shows remaining flags through yellow squares. There is only a limited amount of time, represented through a green bar gradually filled up with red as time passes. Two additional actions are possible: a boost with additional speed and leaving behind smoke against opponents. Occasionally, there is a special stage as well.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Promat", "publishers": "Promat", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.88", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrSKDRr5jDI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/105478"}
