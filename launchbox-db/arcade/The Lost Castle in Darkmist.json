{"name": "The Lost Castle in Darkmist", "overview": "The Lost Castle in Darkmist was produced by Taito in 1986.<br><br><br>A vertically scrolling beat 'em up game where the player controls a knight who battles against a variety of magical characters. Collect potions, power-ups and bonus items from the treasure chests left by slain enemies. Defeat the boss enemies to proceed to the next level.<br><br>Use the Sword button to swing the character's weapon at enemies and their projectile attacks. When a treasure chest appears, you must first walk over it and then wait for the item to appear before it can be collected. Try to remain in the center of the screen and only fight enemies when necessary since the character's health decreases rapidly when under attack.<br>In some areas, the screen scrolls quite rapidly so it is important to keep moving. If the character becomes trapped behind a wall as the screen scrolls, a life will be lost.<br><br>The game plays similar to Gun.Smoke except with a mythical fantasy theme.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Taito", "publishers": "Seibu Kaihatsu", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oc8Fa7tb8c", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/39603"}
