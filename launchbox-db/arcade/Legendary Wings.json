{"name": "Legendary Wings", "overview": "Legendary Wings is an arcade shooter influenced by Greek mythology. A heroic figure from ancient times thrust into a strange futuristic world, you must fight your way through six levels to defeat \"The Devil\" and save the day.<br><br>The primary gameplay mode is a top-down, vertical-scrolling shooter similar to Xevious and Capcom's own 1943. Your main weapon is used to attack flying enemies, and your secondary missile weapon is used to attack fixed placement, land-based enemies. Numerous powerups are available along the way, and these both improve your weapons and your resistance to damage (every \"upgrade\" is worth a free hit from enemies without dying).<br><br>Several secondary gameplay modes (Danger, Lucky, and Palace) are also triggered at key points in the vertical-scrolling mode. All of the secondary modes are side-scrolling shooters. The Danger stage requires you to face a gauntlet of enemies, while the Lucky stage is full of powerups, game continues, and other bonuses. The Palace stage is triggered when you defeat a mini-boss; you must get past the palace defenses before you can face the end-of-stage boss. And, oh yeah...don't get crushed by those walls!", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "November 1, 1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Capcom", "publishers": "Capcom", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.28", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f4jWQyf-fs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/30638"}
