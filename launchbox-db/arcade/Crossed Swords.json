But it didn't stop there, from deep within the mountains of Graisia, the Demon Warlord Nausizz arose and led the attacks wiping out settlement after settlement. However a brave warrior called \"The Knight of the Journey\" came a long way on a quest to stop these monstrosities.<br><br>Crossed Swords is a hack & slash action RPG arcade game. The game allowed cooperative gameplay with up to two players on the same screen. As only the player characters' silhouettes are visible on screen as wire-frame models, much like Punch-Out!!, the game's perspective may be considered either first-person or third-person. The game was later cited as an inspiration for the 2010 first-person fighting game Rage of the Gladiator.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Alpha Denshi", "publishers": "SNK", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.57", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H485or8VOC8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/28859"}
