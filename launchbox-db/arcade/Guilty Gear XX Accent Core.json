{"name": "Guilty Gear XX Accent Core", "overview": "Guilty Gear XX Accent Core is the third version of Guilty Gear X2. In addition to balance changes, Accent Core features a new type of special move, the \"Force Break,\" which uses 25% of the tension gauge. It also introduces moves that make opponents stick briefly to walls or slide across the floor of a stage. New additions also include \"Slashback,\" a form of parrying with reduced block stun, and throw breaks. Both versions of the game feature three gameplay modes per character, based on the Guilty Gear, Guilty Gear X, and Accent Core fighting systems. Accent Core also underwent a major aesthetic change for the series. In addition to a new opening movie, and a redesigned menu, all voices, including that of the announcer, have been re-recorded (or replaced with previously unused samples), sometimes by different actors. The playable character artwork was also redone, and new background songs were added. On the other hand, the Story Mode, as well as Justice and Kliff were removed.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "December 20, 2006", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Arc System Works", "publishers": "Arc System Works", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/101102"}
