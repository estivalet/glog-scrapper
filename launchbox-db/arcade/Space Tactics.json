{"name": "Space Tactics", "overview": "Space Tactics was produced by Sega in 1980.<br><br>Defend your bases by shooting the oncoming alien swarms.<br><br>This game is a take-off on Space Invaders, but with a number of interesting twists. You start off with five bases at the bottom of the screen that you defend with your laser. A shield with limited renewal capability is also available to further protects these bases. Each base is also capable of firing a large single shot.<br>The alien ships attack in a dizzying 3-D pattern, but what sets this game apart is that instead of moving your cross-hairs around the screen, the entire screen is motorized and moves to fit within your cross-hairs! It gives the effect of a very large screen with smooth scrolling.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "October 1, 1980", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFm1gIw2FKg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/39035"}
