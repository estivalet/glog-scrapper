It was also published by U.S. Billiards.<br><br>You control a red piranha with your 4-way joystick, eating all the dots on the screen while avoiding four squids that are after you. The four corners each have an \"energizer pellet\" that, once eaten, allows you to attack and eat the squid who were chasing you. Clearing all edible objects from the screen advances you to the next screen.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "GL Inc.", "publishers": "GL Inc.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.57", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLzt1wlB2DQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/38127"}
