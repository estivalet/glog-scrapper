{"name": "Arkanoid Returns", "overview": "Arkanoid Returns is an arcade game released by Taito Corporation in February 1997 as part of the Arkanoid series. It was the fourth overall, and third to be released in arcades. It is largely similar to its predecessor Arkanoid: Doh It Again as it has the same power-ups (plus the Giga-Ball) and board size. Some of the level designs have even been reused. The game has 50 levels, and the theme changes every 9 levels. Unlike past games, it doesn't have any boss battles.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Taito Corporation", "publishers": "Taito Corporation", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.54", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49geCAqnuDc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/11629"}
