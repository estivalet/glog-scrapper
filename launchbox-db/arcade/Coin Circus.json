{"name": "Coin Circus", "overview": "Coin Circus revolves around a circus theme, where a bright, colourful, 3-Dimensional clown is the center of attention in an attractive mirror lined cabinet. He holds four arms which rotate around in a circle and move up and down. Each arm represents a different ticket value which are set at different difficulty levels.<br><br>As the drum roll plays, the players can test their skill as they drop a coin or token and try to have the arms \"catch\" the coin. Miss the shot and the coin drops into a bonus wagon. The clown laughs and taunts the player to try again. Make the shot and light up the first of a bank of lights on the bonus wagon. This adds a whole new dimension to the game. If any player successfully makes 5 shots, the bonus wagon lets down a cascade of coins similar to the effect of a coin pusher paying out a jackpot.<br><br>Coin Circus is completely operator adjustable for both bonus pay-out and individual arm ticket values. Can also be set up for no ticket operation for those locations that do not operate redemption.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/154913"}
