By collecting the right power-up you can transform into Wonder Momo for a limited time, who can perform ranged attacks with a hoola-hoop and is more powerful than regular Momo.<br><br>Not only must you clear the enemies of each stage, but also please the crowd with your performances, being wary of perverts that attempt to take pictures of your underwear whenever you attack (Momo shows quite a bit of leg whenever she \"kicks high\") which results in blinding flashes that stun Momo and leave her open to an attack.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "February 24, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Namco", "publishers": "Namco", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.61", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40184"}
