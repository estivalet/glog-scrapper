{"name": "Thunder Force II", "overview": "Thunder Force II is a shoot-'em-up developed by Technosoft and the second installment in their Thunder Force series.<br><br>The Mega-Tech System is an arcade cabinet released by Sega in 1989. It was based on the Sega Mega Drive home console, and was designed similarly to Nintendo's PlayChoice-10: players chose games from a menu of eight titles, with credits buying more play time (usually 1 minute per credit) rather than extra lives or continues; reaching a game over screen does not end the play session, and players can start over or choose a different game as long as there was some play time remaining. The Mega-Tech was not released in North America, though did see use in Asia and the PAL regions.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "TechnoSoft", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/q3lrOymPx0s", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/158162"}
