{"name": "Crazy Taxi", "overview": "Crazy Taxi is an arcade racer where the player takes the role of a taxi driver who weaves his way through crowded streets, across sidewalks and even under water, in a wild and frantic race to deliver passengers on time. The courses are largely set inside cities crowded with general traffic and pedestrians (which can't be run over, they dive away). The main goal is to bring as many customers as possible to their destination in time. Available customers are marked through circles and the color represents the distance and the fare they offer. Green means long rides with plenty of money, and red ones are very short.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hitmaker", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.29", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjIGkv0_dEM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/28736"}
