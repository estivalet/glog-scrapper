{"name": "Kyros", "overview": "A very impressive vertically scrolling beat-em-up with cool monsters like Dracula. Kairos has kidnapped children and trapped them in mirrors inside his castle. The player takes the role of Mac in his quest so save them.<br><br>The main portion of the game is spend with walking through the castle and fighting Kairo's henchmen - either with bare hands or with weapons which can be collected on the way. However, the way is not completely linear: there are different routes to take. A boss room waits at the end of each level (overall five). There are also a multitude of extras to collect which have effects like destroying all enemies on the screen or warping. Freeing enough children by punching out mirrors gives a short time of invulnerability.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Alpha Denshi", "publishers": "Alpha Denshi", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/T4ef0kCjmRY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/37114"}
