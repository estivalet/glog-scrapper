{"name": "Shootout at Old Tucson", "overview": "Shootout at Old Tucson is a live-action laserdisc video game, released by American Laser Games in 1994 in the arcade. The game saw a limited production run and was the only release by the company never to be ported from the arcade. Soon after the game appeared on the market, American Laser Games went out of business, which, along with technical issues which limited its popularity in the arcades, further contributed to the title's obscurity. Shootout at Old Tucson was also one of the first games by American Laser Games developed based on 3DO technology. The game was filmed at Old Tucson Studios.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "American Laser Games", "publishers": "American Laser Games", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/122036"}
