{"name": "DonPachi", "overview": "DonPachi (??? DonPachi?, A play on the words \"Leader Bee\" and \"Gunfire\") is a vertically scrolling manic shooter video game developed by Cave and published by Atlus in 1995. It was the first game developed by Cave, and the second on Cave's first generation arcade hardware (the first being Power Instinct 2). Literally translated, the title means \"leader bee\", but it is also a Japanese onomatopoeic expression associated with the sound of firing guns. It is one of the first manic shooters. This game received a sequel in the form of DoDonPachi.<br><br>DonPachi features a scoring system known as Get Point System (GPS). By destroying large groups or chains of enemies in a short period of time, you can build up a number called a combo, similar to the kind found in fighting games. You receive an increasing number of points with every enemy you shoot down; the more enemies you hit in one chain, the more points you receive. You can break the chain by waiting to shoot an enemy; the combo number will turn blue when your chain is broken. This system brings a new challenge after the player has cleared the game; plot out the stages to achieve a high score.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "November 25, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Cave", "publishers": "Atlus", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.16", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDZAso9vsX0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/24107"}
