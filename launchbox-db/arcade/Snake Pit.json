{"name": "Snake Pit", "overview": "Snake Pit was produced by Bally Sente in 1984.<br><br>Snake Pit is a 2D top down arcade game. The player controls a character trapped in a snake pit. He must kill snakes by whipping them (like Indiana Jones). If he kills all snakes (and other creatures, like scorpions), he will go to the next level. Each snake is very dangerous, and kills the player instantly. The game has a non-typical controls scheme - a trackball for moving and joystick for whipping.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bally Sente", "publishers": "Bally Sente", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.18", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsQeag-bIdw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/12384"}
