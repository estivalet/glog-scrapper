Getting enough power-ups causes more blocks to be added to your opponent's side.<br><br>Each match sees the two opponents each smashing blocks in their own seperate well, and the match can end in one of three ways: a player can win by clearing all the blocks in their well, or they can lose by either losing their ball off the bottom of the screen (though each player does start with a row of multi-hit bricks behind them, so this rarely happens) or by having their bat crushed by descending blocks.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kid", "publishers": "Visco Corporation", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.95", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOPYRqlx5OI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/35225"}
