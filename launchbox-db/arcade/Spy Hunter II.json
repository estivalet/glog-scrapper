{"name": "Spy Hunter II", "overview": "In Spy Hunter II you control a car racing down a road in third-person perspective viewed behind the car, instead of an overhead view as in the original game. In this sequel you start with guns as your main weapon and accumulate additional weapons like in the original game: oil slick, smoke screen, and missiles from the Weapons Van.<br><br>Enemies on the road range from motorcyclists to dune buggies, and air enemies consist of dune buggy-style helicopters. Enemies on the road can be taken out with your guns and (when obtained from the van) oil slick and smoke screen, but the dune buggy copter must be taken out by missiles. The Weapons Van that appears periodically, when entered, awards you with a new weapon, and also keeps the active vehicle stocked with weapons. The screen displays which weapon is active, your score, which gear you are in, and a radar, which helps you to look out for oncoming enemies. Damage to your vehicle is represented by bullet holes on the screen. Take enough damage, and you lose your vehicle, which bursts in flames.<br><br>Gameplay is available with single player, or simultaneous two player, where both players play cooperatively. The screen is shared by both players, but split down the middle by a bezel (or divider) in front of the screen, and the machine cabinet comes equipped with two steering wheels, two gas pedals, gear shifts, and buttons for the different weapons.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bally Midway Mfg Co.", "publishers": "Bally Midway Mfg Co.", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.15", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/39103"}
