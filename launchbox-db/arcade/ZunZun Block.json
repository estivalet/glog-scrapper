{"name": "ZunZun Block", "overview": "ZunZun Block was produced by Taito in 1979.<br><br>ZunZun Block is a Breakout variant. The player controls a paddle at the bottom of the screen and must bounce a ball to destroy all the bricks at the top. The player has limited balls which are lost if they are not bounced back. The ball speeds up over time and a powerup will scroll sidewards across the screen which when hit slows the ball down again. Points are based on the row in which the hit brick resides. There's an empty space between the bottom rows and top rows. Getting the ball in between can lead to a big boost in points as the ball gets stuck there and destroys lots of bricks.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1979", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Taito", "publishers": "Taito", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1PNdUgVP_U", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40289"}
