{"name": "Cutie Q", "overview": "Cutie Q is the second sequel to Gee Bee after Bomb Bee which appeared just a few months earlier. Like the previous two games, Cutie Q combines Breakout with pinball although with a few changes. A rotary joystick is used to control two paddles that are used to hit bricks (here called rainbow blocks) and various elements from a pinball table. This time there are no bumpers but there are other objects instead. Most noticeable is a creature called Minimon which appear in the centre top section of the table. Every time the ball hits the bottom paddle a new Minimon will appear up to a maximum of four. On each side of the Minimons are sets of bricks and when these are cleared another creature will appear that is called a walkman. Another new feature are the sidetraps that can catch the ball and award bonus points for every bounce of the ball. Unlike the previous games the ball is not served from the paddle but from the side of the table like in a pinball game.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "November 1, 1979", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Namco", "publishers": "Namco", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.23", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/35741"}
