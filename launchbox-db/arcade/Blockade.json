{"name": "Blockade", "overview": "Blockade is the first of what would later become known as light cycle games. It's a game for two players only, each who controls an arrow that leaves behind a trail of blocks that form a wall. The arrow moves automatically forward and by using four buttons the player is able to steer it by making ninety degree turns. The aim of the game is simply to stay alive longer than the opponent by not crashing into any of the walls. If a crash occurs the opponent will win the round and be awarded with one point. By default the player that first reaches six points wins the game but the value can be changed by the game operator.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "October 1, 1976", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gremlin", "publishers": "Gremlin", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.88", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5v-0CwiabZA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/35223"}
