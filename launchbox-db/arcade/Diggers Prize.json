{"name": "Diggers Prize", "overview": "\"Digger's Prize\" is unique whereby players compete against their own depleting fuel levels to dig as many balls as possible, using push button or joystick controls. Once balls are picked up by the digger arm, the player then needs to drop the balls into the dumper truck. This in turn moves to a conveyor belt system which carries the balls to a hopper with a tonnage gauge. This indicates how many tonnes have been dug.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/145690"}
