{"name": "Sea Wolf II", "overview": "Sea Wolf II was produced by Midway Manufacturing Co. in 1978.<br><br>A timed submarine game where players look through large periscopes to aim at ships moving across the top of the screen. Torpedos are launched with a thumb button on the right handle of the scope, but mines floating across the screen can block these torpedoes. The fast-moving PT Boat is the hardest to hit.<br><br>Players look through periscopes to aim at ships. Up to two targeting cross-hairs and the number of torpedos remaining are seen through the scopes. When the players have launched five torpedos, a red \"RELOAD\" light comes on momentarily. These are not shown on the screen, but are back-lit transparencies reflected inside the scopes. Likewise, when ships are hit on the screen, an explosion \"light\" is reflected inside the scopes. Torpedos are fired by pressing a thumb-button on the right-hand periscope handle. This time the game is two player simultanious and in color.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "June 1, 1978", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dave Nutting Associates", "publishers": "Midway", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "2.63", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9VXvkVgQa4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/38749"}
