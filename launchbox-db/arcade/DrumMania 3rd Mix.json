{"name": "DrumMania 3rd Mix", "overview": "Konami brings the beat back again! Here the player sits behind a virtual drumset and lets him or her loose on a variety of groovy music! As with any new update, there's new music to jam to!<br><br>As always with other bemani titles, select a song, and using the drumsticks and footpedal, pound out some crazy beats on the realistic drumset as the notes fall to the bottom of the screen.<br><br>Using the drumset, play along with the song as best as possible without missing too many notes. Do well enough, and you can continue. Fail, and you are finished. New in this version in addition to the music, is the 'Session Mode.' In this mode, a Drummania player can link up with a Guitar Freaks 4th Mix player to play on the same song!", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Music", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/36031"}
