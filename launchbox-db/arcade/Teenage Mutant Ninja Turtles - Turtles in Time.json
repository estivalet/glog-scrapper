{"name": "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time", "overview": "Sunday evening. You're sitting around the sewer watching your main reporter, April O'Neil do a live remote from the Statue of Liberty, then it happens. A humungoso flying android screams out of the sky and rips Lady Liberty from her foundation, sending hundreds of freaked out tourists into the harbor below. \"No way!\" cries Raphael. \"Way\", replies Donatello, and the crazy quantum chase is on! <br><br>Journey through multiple levels of enormous graphics, the largest and craziest talking Turtles ever with eons of bodacious battlegrounds, from prehistoric to futuristic galaxies. Get ready for the 3-D jab and toss that sends enemies flying right in your face. Mondo body slams and pizza power bonuses make you more Turtle than ever before. You better believe you're going to need it. Shredder's out for Turtle hide. And he's got all the time in the world to get it.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "September 18, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "RP - Rating Pending", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.62", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rfnik_HyPc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/7689"}
