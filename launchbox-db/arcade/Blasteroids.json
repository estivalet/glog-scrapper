{"name": "Blasteroids", "overview": "As the name suggests, this arcade conversion updates the basic Asteroids gameplay. That means to say that the main gameplay consists of flying through single-screen wrap-around levels shooting at rocks, which split into smaller rocks when hit, eventually becoming small enough to disappear.<br><br>In this case the Asteroids are protecting Mukor, an evil being who is poisoning planets under the Colonising Corp\u2019s control. Each level is split into either 9 or 16 sub-levels, which are chosen through a square in which any remaining level which is adjacent to the last level completed can be selected. There are 3 different ships (Speeder, Fighter and Warrior), which can be switched between at any time. Power-ups (including improved weapons, shield recharges and a faster thrust) can be collected by flying into them.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atari", "publishers": "Atari", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.37", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbmeX64041s", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6147"}
