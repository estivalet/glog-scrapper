{"name": "Professor Pac-Man", "overview": "Taking a huge turn from the rest of the series, Professor Pac-Man acts as a quiz game, asking classroom style questions like analogies, completing figures, and memory challenges. Pac-Man dons a cap and pointer and acts as teacher to your pupil. Multiple choices are given with a timer represented by Pac-Man eating dots. The more dots left by the time you answer correctly, the more points you're awarded. At first you are given second chances to answer questions, but after a certain number of incorrect answers, the game is over. Pac-Man eats the dots more quickly as the game progresses. After several correct answers, bonus questions are given out.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "August 12, 1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bally Midway", "publishers": "Bally Midway", "genres": "Quiz", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/38289"}
