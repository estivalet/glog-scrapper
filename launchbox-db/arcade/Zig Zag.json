{"name": "Zig Zag", "overview": "Zig Zag is a bootleg version of Dig Dug. There are 2 versions of it, and they play slightly differently.<br><br>The more commonly known one is built on Dig Dug hardware, and plays identically to Dig Dug.<br><br>Another version is built on Moon Cresta hardware (itself a version of the Galaxian hardware). The pump from the original game is not present, with the player needing to get up close to the enemies to kill them. The player can also dig underneath rocks and let them fall on top of enemies for additional points. Unlike Namco's game, a pickax power-up was added, which will allow the player to dig faster for a very brief period of time. Vegetable bonus items do not appear in the game, an omission from the original title. The game ends after 99 levels, causing the game's hardware to overflow and glitch, resulting in a soft-lock or a kill-screen.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Taito of Brazil", "publishers": "LAX", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPNgFPdBJVc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133522"}
