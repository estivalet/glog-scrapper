{"name": "Guzzler", "overview": "Guzzler is a coin operated arcade maze game developed and manufactured by Tehkan Ltd., and licensed to Centuri for United States distribution in 1983. It was released as a conversion kit, including a new marquee and control panel.<br><br>In Guzzler, you play a small transparent character trapped in a maze filled with walking flames, born from stationary fires. In order to survive, you must extinguish flames \u2014 and their mother fires \u2014 by filling up with water from a few puddles spread out around the screen (similar to the power pills of Pac-Man) and spit it out on the fires. However, once you are filled to the top, you move slower, making you a prone victim of the fires. One refill from a puddle is good enough for three cascades of water, making you lighter \u2014 and faster \u2014 each time you spit, but the range of your deluge will also be shorter. From time to time, an alcoholic beverage appears in the middle of the screen, the fires will momentarily freeze while you are fully recharged and may put them out at leisure.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "June 1, 1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tehkan", "publishers": "Tehkan", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZbGuQBGkcw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/29431"}
