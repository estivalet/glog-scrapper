{"name": "Insector (prototype)", "overview": "Insector \u00a9 1982 Gottlieb.<br><br>You are a can of bug spray. Collect the jewels on the screen and destroy all the bugs.<br>This was Skelly's second game for Gottlieb, but it was never released. Number produced estimated at 1 or 2 units. This game represents Skelly's own answer to \"Robotron - 2084\".<br><br>The cool thing about Insector is the three-letter code in at the start. Tim Skelly used this value as a seed for each player's pseudo random number generator. That way, if you want exactly the same game every time, you enter the same three letters. If you wanted to handicap yourself, you would enter different letters and let the other player enter their usual letters, etc.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gottlieb", "publishers": "Never Published (Prototype)", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/115007"}
