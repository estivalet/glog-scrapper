{"name": "King of Dynast Gear", "overview": "King of Dynast Gear is a scrolling platform run 'n' gun game for one or two players in which two starships from the year 2993 AD fall through a time-hole and end up 65 million years in the past, above a prehistoric Earth-like planet. One ship is piloted by hero and 'time patroller', Roger, while the other is piloted by the evil Gustaf. The two ships shoot each down and crash-land onto the planet below, where Roger discovers that Gustaf has transformed many of the planet's dinosaurs into aggressive 'combat dinosaurs'.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "EZ Graphics", "publishers": "", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.38", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynx02tFNM48", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/115030"}
