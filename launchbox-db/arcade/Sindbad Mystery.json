{"name": "Sindbad Mystery", "overview": "Sindbad Mystery is an arcade game that was released by Sega in 1983; it runs on their G80 Raster hardware, but with an extra Z80 running at 4 MHz to drive two Texas Instruments SN-76496s for the sound. Described as an \"Intelligent Puzzle Game\" upon the title screen, the player must use a 4-way joystick to take control of the eponymous Sindbad (as in \"The Sailor\"), and direct him around various different mazes to collect thirty question marks (to reveal the parts of the maze on a treasure map at the top of the screen), while avoiding the various enemies - and, once he collects one question mark in a particular part of the maze it will reveal the location of a treasure item for that round. He will then have to dig up that spot (by means of a button), to find the treasure item; once he has done it, he will receive the remaining value of the round's timer as a bonus and the text \"NICE PLAY! GO TO NEXT ISLAND\" will appear on the screen (Pengo also appears jumping out of the water during this screen).", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.05", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zg_5L6exU8U", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/38886"}
