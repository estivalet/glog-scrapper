{"name": "Gals Panic S3", "overview": "The game begins with a stage select screen. The girls in series fly to the middle of the screen from the four corners until one is selected. Once a stage is selected the object is to cover the colored area of the girl, while avoiding the monsters and their weapons. The stage is completed once 80% of the girl is revealed. At 90% uncovered, the player is treated to the SHOWTIME image of the girl posed in her panties and bra. At 100% revealed, the player is rewarded with the SHOWTIME DX image revealing her in a different pose without her bra. Unlike in previous games in the Gals Panic S series, SHOWTIME DX is a static image and NOT a video clip.<br>Released in July 2002.<br>Gals Panic S3 was Kaneko's last video game. After producing this game, Kaneko went bankrupt (because Kaneko was sued by Hitachi, so all future video game projects were cancelled).", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "2002", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.86", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/36345"}
