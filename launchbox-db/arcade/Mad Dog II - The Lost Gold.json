{"name": "Mad Dog II: The Lost Gold", "overview": "The anonymous main character must track down the wanted outlaw himself, eliminating any and all gang members and hostiles along the way; from the introduction, one can conclude that he or she will be up against renegade Indians, banditos and \"Mad Dog's sleazy crew\".<br>The player proceeds through the game, first by taking a preparatory shooting lesson with a stagecoach driver \u2013 played by Ben Zeller, who appeared in the role of the prospector in the original game \u2013 and then by choosing one of three guides: Buckskin Bonnie, the Professor and Shooting Beaver. Each guide takes the player along a different, unique route, but they converge in the game's final shootouts, which take place inside a moving train and in Mad Dog's hideout; the latter scene is especially lengthy and culminates with a showdown with McCree himself.<br>However, hunting down and defeating the infamous gunfighter is not the player's only goal; Mad Dog has hidden a chest full of treasure in his hideout and it is up to the player to get it back from him. At times, the player will discover that the treasure chest is full of sand and obviously does not contain the \"lost gold\". However, this scene does not always occur unless the player has reached the end using more than one credit", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "American Laser Games", "publishers": "American Laser Games", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.1", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/37276"}
