{"name": "3-D Bowling", "overview": "3-D Bowling is a bowling game for one or two players and successor to Meadows Lanes. The player controls a bowler at the bottom of the screen and can move him left and right. When the ball is let go it can be made to go fast or slow and hooked right or left. After ten rounds, the player with most points wins the game. Compared to its predecessor, it's mostly in animations that the game has changed, with the player's character reacting differently to all outcomes. In the cocktail table version of the game, the screen will mirror upside down when the player changes.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1978", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Meadows", "publishers": "Meadows", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.82", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMilEtkKGZA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/34856"}
