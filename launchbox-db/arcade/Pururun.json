{"name": "Pururun", "overview": "PuRuRun is a puzzle game where the goal is to put four or more blobs of the same color next to each other to make them pop. Each blob has an outer color and an inner color and when the blobs pop, they change into their inner color. Keep linking the blobs until you guide our heroes Pipi and Moko to the goal. To help them reach the goal quicker you can try creating chain reactions by linking outer/inner combinations. If it gets too cluttered there's a limited amount of bombs that can clear the grid a bit. The game has 24 stages and also features a two player co-op mode.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Metro Corporation", "publishers": "Metro Corporation", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.58", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/38315"}
