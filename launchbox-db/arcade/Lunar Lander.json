{"name": "Lunar Lander", "overview": "The objective of Lunar Lander is to pilot a lunar landing module as it prepares to touch down on the moon. The terrain is very jagged and has only a few flat areas appropriate for landing. These areas are highlighted with a flashing bonus multiplier, which is higher for smaller areas. If the player successfully lands the module, he or she is awarded points based on how good the landing was and the difficulty of the landing site. If he or she crashes, points are awarded based on the severity of the crash and sometimes the player receives a fuel penalty. In either case, the game starts another round with a different set of terrain and the player's remaining fuel. The game is over when the player has run out of fuel and crashes on the moon's surface.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "August 1, 1979", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atari", "publishers": "Atari", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.51", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzdxjaVm_HQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/12174"}
