{"name": "Mine, Mine, Mine", "overview": "Mine Mine Mine from Aristocrat, a 25-line 10x max bet slot machine with a mining theme.<br><br>Along with the traditional A, K, Q, J 10 and 9 the game\u2019s symbols include giant gold nuggets, a bucket of gold nuggets, a scale weighing nuggets and a jolly bearded miner juggling emeralds and rubies.<br><br>The game features two different bonuses. When three or more dynamite symbols appear anywhere on the screen the bonus feature is triggered. You get to choose either the \"Free Game\" bonus or the \"Mine Car\" bonus.<br><br>The Free Game bonus awards you with three to 10 free spins with up to three of the symbols wild.<br><br>The Mine Car bonus takes you to a mine, with the track forming a pyramid with a mine car perched at the top. The mine car is loaded with gold nuggets and colored gems (three gems for each line played). The car tips and the gold nuggets and gems fall down the tracks into a row of buckets at the bottom of the shaft.<br><br>Each bucket is labelled with a credit amount. When a nugget or gem goes into a bucket, the credits increase with each one collected. Two of the buckets are labelled free. The nuggets and gems falling into these buckets both increase your credits and drop in an additional bucket.<br><br>As long as nuggets and gems fall into the free buckets, they continue to fall. When nothing falls into these buckets, the bonus is over.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Aristocrat", "publishers": "Aristocrat", "genres": "Casino", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/37630"}
