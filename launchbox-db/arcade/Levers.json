{"name": "Levers", "overview": "Levers is a platform arcade game that was released by Rock-Ola in 1983; as with Jump Bug, it runs on Namco's Galaxian board (a Zilog Z80 microprocessor, running at 3.072 MHz), but with a General Instrument AY-3-8910 running at 1.78975 MHz for audio. The player must use a four-way joystick to take control of a small orange-skinned man, with a red suit and hat, whose objective is to jump from one seesaw-like platform (or lever) to another in order to collect all eighteen flowers on the screen - but if he should fall off the bottom of the screen or get hit by a large rolling marble, he will lose a life. This was also to be the last videogame that the Rock-Ola Manufacturing Corporation would release.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Rock-Ola", "publishers": "Rock-Ola", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "1.58", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUMld31KYNM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/30631"}
