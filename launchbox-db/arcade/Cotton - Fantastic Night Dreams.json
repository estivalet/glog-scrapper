{"name": "Cotton: Fantastic Night Dreams", "overview": "Created by a small company named Success and marketed in the arcades by Sega, Cotton is a cutesy shoot-em-up featuring an adorable little witch. The early entries are fairly standard side-scrolling shoot-em-ups, and mostly rely on the adorable pink-haired main character, who rides a broom, who attacks with magic spells and has one of the most hilarious death screams in all of video gaming. The original game saw a release in America for the arcades, TurboGrafx-16 Super CD and Neo Geo Pocket Color, but the rest stayed in Japan.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Success", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.94", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_8Bv83WEsE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/35661"}
