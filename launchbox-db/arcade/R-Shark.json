{"name": "R-Shark", "overview": "R-Shark is a 2D vertical-scrolling sci-fi shoot'em up. The player takes the role of a headhunter, and gets to chose to go after one of eight interstellar criminals. Gameplay is similar to a myriad of other shmups: The player in a special space ship flies and shoots at enemies - main interstellar criminals are bosses. His ship has a weak main weapon, and some support in the form of homing missiles, but better weapons like a laser can be acquired. Weapons are also upgradable and offer super attacks.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dooyong", "publishers": "Dooyong", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.37", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KQTgsxirEs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/38648"}
