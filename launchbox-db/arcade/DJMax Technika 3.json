There are various different note types as well, and each category of notes are played in a different manner. Whilst playing, the fever meter builds up as notes are successfully touched on progression; once full the player may activate Fever mode, which increases the score value of each note for a limited duration. The \"groove meter\" will decrease if notes are missed, and once empty the player fails the chart and the game concludes.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "October 27, 2011", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Pentavision", "publishers": "Pentavision", "genres": "Music", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soeaoJplXKU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/154851"}
