{"name": "Pac-Mania", "overview": "Pac-Mania is an isometric maze game. The player controls Pac-Man, a yellow circular creature that must eat all of the pellets in each stage while avoiding the five colored ghosts - Blinky, Pinky, Inky, Clyde and Sue. Eating large Power Pellets will cause the ghosts to turn blue and flee, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for bonus points and send them to the house in the middle of the stage. Clearing the stage of pellets will allow Pac-Man to move to the next.<br><br>New to this game is the ability to jump over the ghosts, allowing Pac-Man to evade capture. Later areas of the game will introduce two new ghosts - the green ghost Funky and the steel gray ghost Spunky - who also have the ability to jump on later levels. While Pac-Man can still jump over Funky, it is impossible to jump over Spunky. Eating a certain number of pellets will cause a bonus item to appear in the middle of the stage, which Pac-Man can eat up for points. Some of these bonus items are called Special Items, which are items from later levels, or are Red and Green Power Pellets. Red Power Pellets double the point values of blue ghosts (this bonus is lost if Pac-Man loses a life), and Green Power Pellets temporarily increase Pac-Man's speed. If the player makes Pac-Man stay on the same stage for too long, his jump strength weakens until he cannot jump at all, making him unable to jump over Funky as well.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "November 1, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Namco", "publishers": "Namco", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.44", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06LT-jNWxOA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/26070"}
