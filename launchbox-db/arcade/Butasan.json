{"name": "Butasan", "overview": "Butasan (\u3076\u305f\u3055\u3093) (also known as Mr. Pig and Pig and Bombers) is a 1987 arcade game developed by NMK and Jaleco.<br><br>The player controls a pig and the aim of the game is to blow up other pigs by throwing bombs at them. The bombs are randomly spawned across the map and can be picked up and thrown at the other pigs. The bombs are given a number between 5 and 30; when the bomb is thrown it takes that number of seconds to explode. Bombs which directly hit pigs explode on contact. Various power ups are available throughout the game such as gas that makes all other characters fall asleep.<br><br>A bonus sub-game involves random pigs popping out of holes, and the player must knock them back down the hole with their own pig, in a similar mode of gameplay to Whack-a-mole.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "December 1, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "NMK", "publishers": "Jaleco", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.27", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-aaaCtlIB4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/18266"}
