{"name": "Red Baron", "overview": "Red Baron was produced by Atari in 1980.<br><br>In Red Baron, players take on the role of a World War I pilot as they enter the cockpit of a triplane during an intense dogfight. Players have to shoot down aerial targets like blimps and biplanes and ground targets such as pillboxes and tanks. However, continuously shooting can cause their planes guns to temporarily overheat so players have to be more judicious with their gunfire. Players also have to be careful not to crash into the mountainside they are flying over.<br><br>Shooting both aerial and ground targets will earn the player points. Points for destroying objects is always the same except for bi-planes. The farther away they are when destroyed the more points they are worth. A bonus plane is earned at 2,000, 10,000, and 30,000 points. These points.can also be adjusted to make the game more difficult. Other bonus plane points options include the following; 4,000, 14,000,and 40,000 points or 6,000, 20,000 and 50,000 points, or even the option of having no bonus planes at all. Players can also start the game with between 2 to 5 planes.<br><br>The game pretty much resembles a plane version of Battlezone.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1980", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atari", "publishers": "Atari", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.89", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDsAKW59gOs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/12239"}
