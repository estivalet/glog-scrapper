{"name": "18 Wheeler: American Pro Trucker", "overview": "A truck driving game from Sega. Race another trucker across the country, carrying cargo and trying to beat the clock.<br><br>The main purpose is to make it to the finish line with your cargo within a given time.<br><br>Players choose one of several trucks, each rated in speed, handling, etc. They then race from point to point across the country, hauling cargo (more difficult cargo will increase your pay for that leg of the journey) while avoiding innocent traffic (blare the horn to get drivers out of your way) and trying to outrun a reckless computer opponent (or player two in linked matches). Good performances are rewarded with bonus stages that require players to maneuver the truck in tight alleyways and park the truck in a limited amount of time.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "July 26, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega AM2", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.95", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-4WcMFl5HM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/7579"}
