{"name": "Bang Bang Ball", "overview": "Bang Bang Ball is a puzzle game based on Metro's Mouse Shooter GoGo. Player 1 controls a mouse on a skateboard and player 2 a mouse on roller skates trying to rescue their girlfriend who has been kidnapped by a bunch of cats. The gameplay remains largely the same - throw colored balls at matching balls of the same color to clear the stage. Unlike the first game though there's no button to lock direction, instead there's a 2 player co-op mode (Mouse Shooter GoGo only had a 2 player versus mode). Also, collision with the balls diminishes player's health, in the original game you needed to restart the stage if you were hit once, this game has a life bar (2-5 hits depending on the DIP switch settings).<br><br>The Korean version called Battle Bubble retains the same gameplay, but has different backgrounds", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Good House", "publishers": "Banpresto Co., Ltd.", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVDnFLrM3LY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/35052"}
