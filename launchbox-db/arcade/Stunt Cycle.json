{"name": "Stunt Cycle", "overview": "Stunt Cycle is a 1 player (or 2 players alternating) arcade game by Atari Inc., originally released in 1976. It attempted to cash in on the Evel Knievel craze of the mid 1970s by allowing the player to perform their own simulated motorcycle jumping stunts. The game is housed in a custom cabinet that includes a simulated motorcycle steering column mounted on the control panel.<br><br>The screen is divided into three horizontal platforms connected by tubes on the monitor overlay. The motorcycle automatically drives across each platform in sequence: left to right, right to left, then left to right again. The bottom most platform has a line of parked buses between two ramps, and the goal is to successfully jump the buses and land safely before repeating the process again.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "January 28, 1976", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atari", "publishers": "Atari", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvFHIOy0e5g", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/39208"}
