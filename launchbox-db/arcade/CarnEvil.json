During this process, Jacob obtains a shotgun from the shooting gallery at the entrance to fight through hordes of monsters, zombies, and insects.<br>Jacob faces enemies in the three attractions - the Haunted House, Rickety Town, and Freak Show - and must defeat a strong 'boss character' at the end of each, as well as periodic sub-bosses. After escaping all three areas, he enters the Big Top, and fights clowns and circus animals to reach the center ring, whence he is taken to T\u00f6kkent\u00e4kker's zeppelin to face T\u00f6kkent\u00e4kker and his jester Umlaut.
