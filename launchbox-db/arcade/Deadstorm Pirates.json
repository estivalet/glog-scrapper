{"name": "Deadstorm Pirates", "overview": "Play as one of the pirates manning a ship. Skeleton pirates and other baddies attack you on your quest to claim \"Poseidon's Breath.\" <br><br>The player uses a unique gun which has two triggers, pressing both increases the speed of shot, but runs your ammo down quicker. The arcade cabinet also has a ship's wheel which is used to steer the boat. In these sections the player is given a very short time to turn the ship in the required direction.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "January 1, 2010", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/14907"}
