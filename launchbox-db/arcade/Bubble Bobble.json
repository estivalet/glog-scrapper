{"name": "Bubble Bobble", "overview": "In the game, each player controls one of the two Bubble Dragons, Bub and Bob. The player can move along platforms, as well as jump to those above and to the side, similar to most platform games.<br><br>The player can also blow bubbles. These can trap enemies, who are defeated if the bubble is then burst by the player's spiny back. The bubbles also float for a time before bursting, and can be jumped on, allowing access to otherwise inaccessible areas. Players progress to the next level once all enemies on the current level are defeated.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "January 1, 1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Taito", "publishers": "Taito", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.54", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuXOSBb4hQw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2623"}
