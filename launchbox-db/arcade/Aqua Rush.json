{"name": "Aqua Rush", "overview": "Aqua Rush is a puzzle game with an underwater theme. It's similar to Tetris but instead of blocks falling from the top they here appear from the bottom and move upwards. The blocks are meant to be bubbles and the player has to combine them with static bubbles that are pre placed on the playing field. Similar to Tetris, bubbles that cover the whole width of the playing field burst and disappear. The aim is to make it through the ocean and reach the surface. There are three different levels that are divided into stages. To complete a stage the player has to clear the red bubbles at the top. The levels differ in difficulty and have different pace, puzzle design and distance to the surface. <br><br>Blocks work differently from Tetris. Here they are always three bubbles in size horizontally and they can not be rotated. Instead the player uses three buttons to increase the size and change the shape of the block. By pressing one of the buttons the bubble it represents grows vertically. The idea is then to get a shape that fits perfectly in the spaces and thereby being able to clear large parts of the board.<br><br>In addition to the single player mode there is also a two player split screen mode.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "October 1, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Namco", "publishers": "Namco", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.24", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7O_hWVgzxY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/34966"}
