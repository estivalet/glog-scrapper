{"name": "Jet Fighter", "overview": "In Jet Fighter, two planes fly around with the goal of shooting the other as many times as possible in a dogfight within the time limit. When a plane is hit, an explosion occurs, and the plane recovers after a few seconds. As with many Atari games of the era, if the plane flies off the side of the screen, it comes back on the opposite side.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "October 15, 1975", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atari", "publishers": "Atari", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMObEpsy7Eg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/47358"}
