{"name": "'99: The Last War", "overview": "Repulse is a fixed shooter arcade game released by Sega in 1985. It was renamed 99: The Last War when licensed to Kyugo (who developed the hardware) and Proma. There's also a bootleg version named Son of Phoenix.<br><br>With a spaceship, the player shoots several kind of robotic enemies and spaceships. At the end of every stage (except for the first one), the player meets a huge enemy spaceship as the stage's boss. Player's spaceship is equipped with a limited force shield which allows it to resist any kind of attack, though energy drains both while its active and whenever the ship gets hit during. Power-ups are dropped by ally helicopters and spaceships, that bring to the player a new shot (much faster than the normal one) and refills his force field's meter.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "June 1, 1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Crux", "publishers": "Kyugo", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.1", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFkHffazD10", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/34874"}
