{"name": "Point Blank", "overview": "Point blank is a puzzle/light gun shooter that is merciless in its pace. The premise of the game is based around \"quick fire\" rounds that tests players' accuracy and reactions.<br><br>The game is structured in a very random manner with four non-related stages being displayed for players to choose from each time they complete a stage. Stages are comprised of accuracy tests such as having to shoot the apple off the head of a far away character with only one bullet or judgment tests, such as killing only bad guys in a sea of good guys. Other stages involve solving puzzles by shooting out keys on a keyboard to spell words.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "October 1, 1994", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Namco", "publishers": "Namco", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.98", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/33306"}
