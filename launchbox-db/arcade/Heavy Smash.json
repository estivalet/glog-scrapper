{"name": "Heavy Smash", "overview": "Heavy Smash portrays a futuristic, armored, no-rules version of handball. The player is allowed to select one of various national teams (plus a robot team with a space station as home turf), some of them with an unique armor design reflecting some kind of perceived national tradition (a samurai armor for Japan and a sort of sci-fi football outfit or USA, for example) and some other being just palette swaps. Each team has a distinctive special shot, which has to be loaded up with a power gauge and each team member, in addition to tackling and roughing up opponents with no penalty whatsoever, can even perform a ranged attack in order to gain ball control.<br><br>At its core, it's the typical \u201cwin or go home\u201d coin-op sports game, with increasing difficulty and opponent skill each match.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Data East", "publishers": "Data East", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QCD8u-3YTw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/36711"}
