{"name": "Steel Gunner", "overview": "A very important professor and his daughter have been kidnapped by terrorists and it is up to you and a friend to play as Garcia and Cliff to rescue them. The game is a 1st person perspective rail-shooter where you use a gun to shoot wave after waves of baddies trying to kill you. The game forces you to follow a set path and will scroll in various directions and also stop to allow you to destroy a wave of baddies. There are various types of baddies from foot soldiers to huge flying robots. As well as infinite bullets you also have a limited supply of missiles which destroy everything on screen, but be careful not to shoot ordinary civilians as they will lose part of your energy bar which also decreases when hit by bullets and missiles. When your energy bar is empty then it's game over but you can continue where you last died. At the end of a stage you face a end of stage baddy who requires multiple shots to destroy.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Namco", "publishers": "Namco", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.68", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/Wi8_B2HkHgw?t=73", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/39154"}
