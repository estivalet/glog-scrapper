{"name": "Top Landing", "overview": "Top Landing was produced by Taito in 1988.<br><br>An airplane simulator from Taito, and the sequel to Midnight Landing.<br><br>Top Landing builds on Midnight Landing to create a more comprehensive flight simulator. Flights now take place at day, and the new 3D graphics engine allows scenery to be fully visible. Players again simulate landings at international airports between a number of major world cities; the introductory round also has players praticing takeoffs. The player's primary controls are the flight yoke and throttle for control of the plane's direction and speed; an on-screen control panel also provides airplane status. As in Midnight Landing, the deluxe custom cabinet simulates the interior of an airliner cockpit.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Taito", "publishers": "Taito", "genres": "Flight Simulator", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fj3jmmAElc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/39713"}
