{"name": "Virtual On 2: Oratorio Tangram", "overview": "Cyber Troopers Virtual-ON: Oratorio Tangram (1999) is the sequel to Operation Moongate, which reveals that the whole mess on the Moon was just a distraction from a splinter group within a powerful mega-corporation to allow them to break away from their parent company. Now the two are fighting over several mecha plants in the hope of finding the missing Tangram, a super-computer that is said to have the power to alter reality. Strangely enough, Oratorio Tangram is very rare in many places; for example, some reports that only two arcade machines were ever shipped to the United States. It had a much wider release for the Sega Dreamcast, and even without the twin sticks (even though they existed, but would burn a huge hole in your wallet) it is still a very fun game. Oratan is widely considered to be the best of the series and by far the most popular. It also added more depth into the previous game's mechanics, better gameplay balance, and a slew of new Virtuaroids to chose from.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega AM3", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.56", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYDD--bvRlE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40000"}
