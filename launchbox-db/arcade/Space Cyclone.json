{"name": "Space Cyclone", "overview": "Space Cyclone was produced by Taito in 1980.<br><br>You control a laserbase that fires at approaching enemy ships and alien creatures. A vertical space shooter in which the player controls a laserbase that fires at approaching enemy \"ships\" and alien creatures called \"Bame\". The aliens enter the play area from the top of either side of the screen riding what appear to be clouds. They then jump from the clouds and float towards the earth while firing at the player's laserbase. If the \"Bame\" reach the earth without being destroyed, they construct a ship at the left side of the screen which is completed when three \"Bame\" successfully reach earth. Once completed, the ship takes off and fires a large \"cyclone\" beam at the player. Occasionally a UFO-type alien ship will enter the screen and fire a cyclone-type beam at the player as well.<br><br>The \"voice messages\" include: \"We're coming!\" as the Bame approach the earth, \"Watch out!\" when the alien ship takes off and fires at the player's laserbase and \"Gotcha!\" when the player's laserbase is destroyed.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1980", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Taito", "publishers": "Taito", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLsW0iioN0E", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/7545"}
