{"name": "Car Jamboree", "overview": "In this game, which can be played by one or two players, you control a car and compete with three other cars in an squared arena. Your goal is to destroy the other three cars by crashing into them on the side. A head-on collision has no effect. When all three other cars have been taken out of competition you advance to the next level. In some levels the arena can contain a ramp, which can be used to jump on other cars or a pond in the middle in which you can try to push the other cars to take them out of the competition.<br><br>All this has to be done before you run out of fuel. If any fuel left then you'll receive bonus points.<br><br>The game was ported to the MSX line of computers by Sony in the same year as the original arcade release.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Omori Electronics Corporation", "publishers": "Omori Electronics Corporation", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.65", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQDCioAR8CU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/35398"}
