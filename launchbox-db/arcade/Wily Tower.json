{"name": "Wily Tower", "overview": "Atomic Boy must destroy the \"Kruger K\" satellite that has gone berzerk and is threatening to destroy the world, turning all the inhabitants on board into killer robots. This satellite is located on the fifth floor, and to get there, Atomic Boy must climb up a series of pipes while deactivating the switches along the way. Each switch must be deactivated to unlock the elevator that takes him down to the next floor.<br><br>Stopping Atomic Boy from achieving his goal are robots that can be dealt with in two ways. He can simply jump over them for extra points, or jump on the generators, causing them to send electricity along the pipes from both directions, shocking robots that get in the way. The generators hold five charges, so Atomic Boy must use them sparingly.<br><br>Coming in contact with a robot makes Atomic Boy lose one of his lives, and the game ends if he loses all of them.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.38", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40133"}
