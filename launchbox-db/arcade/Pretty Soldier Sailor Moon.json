Up to five crystals can be collected per player to power up the Senshi's special attacks. During the most difficult moments in battle, Tuxedo Mask will appear and throw a rose, which is a bonus to pick up and depart.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "March 22, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Gazelle", "publishers": "Banpresto", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.88", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W1N8KJbDdg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27104"}
