{"name": "The Irritating Maze", "overview": "The idea is simple: move through the mazes before time runs out. This is not as easy as it sounds, though. Except for Practice Mode, you cannot touch the walls. The maze is not stationary and moving obstacles such as windmills, moving walls, and even a railcar will try to block your every move. The maze is made even more Irritating by the air jets that will blast the player when they fail.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Saurus", "publishers": "SNK", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.58", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZHaXImSPMY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/39583"}
