{"name": "280-Zzzap", "overview": "The game is a simple black and white monochrome driving game. You control a car through a night time scene, and the road is represented by simple posts at the edges. The top of the screen will display information about upcoming curves (like the maximum safe speed to take them at), while the bottom of the screen has a speedometer, timer, scoreboard, and may also display a few tips as well. Just drive, and don't crash. Pay attention to your speed on the corners to avoid crashing.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "September 1, 1976", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dave Nutting Associates", "publishers": "Midway", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.88", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/31593"}
