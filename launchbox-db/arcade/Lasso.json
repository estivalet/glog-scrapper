{"name": "Lasso", "overview": "Lasso is an obscure arcade game, developed and manufactured by SNK Corporation in 1982. In it you play a rancher/cowboy trying to round-up his cattle with a rope.<br><br>The game generously gives you an opportunity to practise throwing the lasso at the beginning with a \u201cwarm-up\u201d screen. Then you have to catch loose sheep and shoot fireballs at attacking wolves\u2026 Ah, you can\u2019t make this stuff up\u2026 Let a wolf or any of your cattle touch you, though, and you lose a life. Lose all three lives and it\u2019s game over.<br><br>If you complete the sheep level, it\u2019s then onto the cow level at a slightly harder difficulty; then the horse level. And so on. Extra hazards, like fire(?) breathing lizards, also become more frequent as the stages progress.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/37147"}
