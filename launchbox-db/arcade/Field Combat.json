{"name": "Field Combat", "overview": "Players are assigned the role as the field commander of the blue colored forces who are in a battle against the red colored forces. Players take control of the Genesis, a flying saucer shaped craft, that can fire missiles, capture enemy units with a tractor beam, and deploy allied units onto the field.<br><br>The game's battlefield is viewed from a top down perspective. The Genesis has a target reticle that is always placed a certain distance in front of the craft. Players have to maneuver this cross-hair over any target they want to shoot or capture. The Genesis can also deploy up to six allied units at any one time to help out on the battlefield. Deployable units include soldiers, Hel-99A (tanks), FL-880 (mobile cannons), Kieths (mechanized infantry), and Louis (copters). The enemy's forces also consist of the same units, and both the Genesis and the enemy's Flying Crane craft can abduct enemy forces and add them to their side.<br><br>At the end of each battlefield is an exit that is defended by enemy turrets which most be destroyed in order to leave the battlefield. The game contains six distinct battlefields that loop back to the beginning when conquered, however the enemies will be more numerous and aggressive on the second time around.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jaleco Ltd.", "publishers": "Jaleco Ltd.", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfgJlLvY2VE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/36181"}
