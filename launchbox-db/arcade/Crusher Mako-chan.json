{"name": "Crusher Mako-chan", "overview": "A quasi-gambling (or \"Medal\") game where you would go on different stage routes that \"altered\" the difficulty (and let you earn more or less medals as you progress).<br><br>Really though, because this is a gambling game, generally everything is luck based and the game can seem very rigged as a result. Sometimes, without even getting the attack up item, you can crush an obstacle with time to spare or even with attack up, there are times when you still lose (if you get the item \"late\"). The game is basically risk versus reward, as you have two opportunities to \"cash out\" or you can attempt the third and final stage (which is always the same regardless of the first two stages you play). You gain items to help (or harm) you randomly as well...and if you get an attack down item, you might as well just stop pressing anything because you are fated to lose no matter what...even with an \"Ultra Star\" it seems.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Takumi Corporation", "publishers": "Takumi Corporation", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.31", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOZr9gidNj0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/35729"}
