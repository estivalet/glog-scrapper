{"name": "Tenth Degree", "overview": "Atari's Tenth Degree, originally Juko Thread, was to combine the elements of the Tekken and Street Fighter style fighting games with an emphasis on speed. Videogames.com got a chance to see Tenth Degree in its early stages, and even played a few rounds on the arcade machine. The characters were designed in a 3D anime style, with both male and female fighters available. In the early stages, developers were discussing having a super deform mode and some other surprises as well. The characters would have had a variety of fighting styles, all designed under the creative awning of James Goddard, who worked on Capcom's Street Fighter series as well as on Namco's Weapon Lord among others.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Atari Games", "publishers": "Atari Games", "genres": "", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/102709"}
