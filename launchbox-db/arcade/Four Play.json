{"name": "Four Play", "overview": "This is a multi-game hack on a standard Galaxian PCB. Meaning it's not so much a ROM hack but an emulated physical hardware hack. Apparently, it is not too tricky to install on the original machine since these games use the same colour set.  It provides a game select menu with the following games listed: Galaxians, Super Galaxians, Galaxian Part X and Exodus.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/122900"}
