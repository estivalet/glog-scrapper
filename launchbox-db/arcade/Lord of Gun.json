{"name": "Lord of Gun", "overview": "In Lord of Gun, a group of gunslingers go out hunting for monsters and enemies. One or two players control the gunslingers from a first-person perspective and simply aim and shoot their lightguns at enemies, until they reach the end of the stage and eliminate a boss enemy. Hostages and steeds are also present and must not be shot, otherwise health is deducted. The player starts with ten health points and a 10-bullet handgun. Health can be replenished by shooting first aid kits and the gun can be reloaded by aiming off-screen. The player can also collect better weapons like shotguns which have limited ammo. From the stages after the first, the player is free to pick the next stage. There are ten stages in total. In between stages, there are also shooting gallery bonus stages.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/37223"}
