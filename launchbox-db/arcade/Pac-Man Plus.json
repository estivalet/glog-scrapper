{"name": "Pac-Man Plus", "overview": "The game plays exactly like the original except that there are various events (apparently selected at random) that may or may not occur after Pac-Man eats one of the four power pellets. These events include but are not limited to: the maze's structure becoming temporarily invisible, the ghosts turning invisible while they are blue, or only three of the four ghosts turning blue. The prizes in the middle of the maze can also act as a power pellet. Another difference is that later in the game the maze's structure becomes permanently invisible. The scoring system is exactly the same as in the original Pac-Man game.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "September 1, 1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bally Midway", "publishers": "Bally Midway", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.47", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXBmGno0N9w", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/30092"}
