{"name": "NARC", "overview": "Infiltrate the criminal underworld - your mission is to seek out and destroy the kingpin of the MR. BIG CORPORATION - if you get that far. You'll have to outwit his enormous army of bodyguards, gangs of charisma-bypass patients in trench coats, the bullet brain with the build of a rhinoceros and the breath of a dung beetle, packs of vicious canine yappies, the psychotic clown with an evil sense of humor - you'll die, but not laughing! The there's the gas-guzzling cadillac jock - a cool specimen, elbow hanging on the door rail, a serious looking piece in his hand and ready to blow you away as he rolls down main street leaving you coughing blood. It's not all bad! You've got a chopper to back you up, a mean, shiny street machine, some heavy metal hardware and some pretty neat moves. And what about the kingpin... did I say he was Mr. Big? No, he's MR. BIG!", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "January 1, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Williams Electronics", "publishers": "Williams Electronics", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sGN894PdEU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/8408"}
