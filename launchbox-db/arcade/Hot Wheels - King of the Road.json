{"name": "Hot Wheels: King of the Road", "overview": "Hot Wheels: King of the Road is a fun multiplayer driving game developed by Coin Crew and Adrenaline Amusements. As the name implies, the challenge is to be the \u201cking of the road\u201d by reaching the end first and collecting as many coins as you can along the Hot Wheels track along the way. Drive one of six real Hot Wheels cars, choose from one of the three tracks, then go, Go, GO!<br><br>Staying true to the Hot Wheels theme, the multi-lane tracks include ramps for catching big air, loop-de-loops and plenty of obstacles that can get in the way of reaching the end first. Each race is a blast of chaotic fun, as the cabinet was designed to handle up to six players at a time! If any spot isn\u2019t taken by a person when the game beings, then it is filled in by the computer. Use the foot pedal to activate a Nitro boost, but use it wisely to keep your advantage. Bonus coins are awarded based upon your finish spot; collect the most and walk away with the most tickets. A dual camera system will also show player faces as avatars in the game", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/157016"}
