{"name": "Super Tank", "overview": "Super Tank is one of two original games manufactured by German company Video Games GmbH. Released in 1981, it was licensed to SNK for the Japanese market and Computran for the US Market.<br><br>In Super Tank, up to two players simultaneously control highly mobile armored tanks on a mission to destroy the SUPER TANK. An introductory collection round challenges the players to clear a field of mines and destroy as many red enemy tanks as possible. Special glowing diamonds are scattered throughout, providing temporary super armor protection and making the players\u2019 task easier.<br><br>After clearing the field of mines, the players are ready for their confrontation with the SUPER TANK! The SUPER TANK is this game\u2019s most dangerous adversary. It is a highly-maneuverable vehicle with a single weakness at the tip of its nozzle. A direct hit on the nozzle will destroy the SUPER TANK, bringing the players to another more intricate collection round where the challenges are greater and so are the rewards.<br><br>Oddly enough, the German and Japanese versions of the game\u2019s flyer depict a flower-laden, treaded vehicle with the head and body of a Roman gentleman, much like a centaur. This vehicle is shown shooting water at other similar vehicles out of his elongated nose. It is thought that restrictions against war games and cultural standards were responsible for these gentle depictions of the military-themed action in the game.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Video Games GmbH", "publishers": "SNK", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.44", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/24909"}
