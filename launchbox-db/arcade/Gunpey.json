{"name": "Gunpey", "overview": "Gunpey is a puzzle game that features a 5\u00d710 grid and line fragments spread across it varying from shape such as caret (\u2227), inverted caret (\u2228), left slash (\uff3c), and right slash (\uff0f). The players are only able to slide the line fragments vertically, either to move them or switch them with another segment. The goal of the game is to piece the broken lines together to form a connected line from one end to the other. After a line is completed, the line will glow, allowing players to connect any additional branching segments to achieve a combo bonus. A bonus is also awarded when all of the line segments are cleared from the playing field.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Banpresto", "publishers": "Bandai", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "1.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LUq5pguhi8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/36633"}
