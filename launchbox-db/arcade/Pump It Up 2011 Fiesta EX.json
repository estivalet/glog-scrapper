{"name": "Pump It Up 2011 Fiesta EX", "overview": "Pump It Up (Korean: \ud38c\ud504 \uc787 \uc5c5; RR: Peompeu it eop) is a music video game series developed and published by Andamiro, a Korean arcade game producer. The game is similar to Dance Dance Revolution, except that it has five arrow panels as opposed to four, and is typically played on a dance pad with five arrow panels: the top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right, and a center. Additional gameplay modes may utilize two five-panel pads side-by-side. These panels are pressed using the player's feet, in response to arrows that appear on the screen in front of the player. The arrows are synchronized to the general rhythm or beat of a chosen song, and success is dependent on the player's ability to time and position his or her steps accordingly.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "January 22, 2011", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Andamiro", "publishers": "Andamiro", "genres": "Music", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRTa_e7J0bw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/154923"}
