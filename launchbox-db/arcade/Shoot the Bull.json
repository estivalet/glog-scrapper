{"name": "Shoot the Bull", "overview": "Shoot the Bull is a darts arcade game that was released by Bally Midway in 1985; it runs on Namco Pac-Man hardware, but was released a whole year after their old Japanese licensors had terminated their 5-year-long partnership. Up to four players can select from one of four modes: (the eponymous) \"Shoot the Bull\", \"Black Out\", \"301\" and \"Poison 301 Pro\" - and they must use a trackball to aim their darts at the on-screen board (with a single button to throw them). In \"Shoot the Bull\" mode, you have to aim at the bullseye in the centre of the board, while in \"Black Out\", you have to aim at the lit areas of it; however, in \"301\" and \"Poison 301 Pro\" modes, the players begin with a score of 301 and must try and reduce it to exactly 0 (and the last one must either land in a doubles section, or the bullseye).", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bally Midway", "publishers": "Bally Midway", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/38847"}
