The player controls a spaceship equipped with a shield to withstand multiple hits, in addition to the standard shot there is a also a more effective special weapon in limited supply available. After taking off, the player flies on a predetermined course with some limited maneuvering room through the stages, facing of against waves of enemies (giant robots for example). At the end of a level, a stronger boss enemy awaits. Once this obstacle has been defeated, the ship's shields get recovered to some extent and the player can continue the flight through various environments, including for example the wide-openness of space, planetscapes covered with trees, and narrow tunnels.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Taito", "publishers": "Taito", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.24", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NShg2Tb3iI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/36315"}
