{"name": "Cruis'n Blast", "overview": "An arcade racer in the long running Cruis'n racing game series. This game marks the first time licensed cars have been in a Cruis'n game, with cars from Lamborghini, Nissan, Chevrolet, and Hummer. In addition to these cars there are also less serious cars like a police car, jeep, and triceratops. Upon starting a race the player can choose to boost a car's engine, handling, paint, or add an additional Blast.<br><br>Cruis'n Blast uses a simplified control system, with only an acceleration pedal, Blast button, and wheel. Briefly releasing the acceleration during a turn will initiate a drift, which will explode into a turbo once the turn is finished. As in previous Cruis'n games double tapping accelerate will hop the car up on two wheels, which will turn into a trick is used to jump over other cars or a ramp. Using a Blast will combine a turbo with a trick. Slamming into AI cars hard enough will destroy them, although any player car is invulnerable.<br><br>The five tracks in the game, Death Valley, Madagascar, London, Rio de Janeiro, and Singapore, all have unique aesthetics and events. A tornado and an earthquake both deform the track in Death Valley, a parade of floats get in the way of the race in Rio, and a T-Rex follows the competitors through Madagascar. At the end of a race any tricks or drifts are subtracted from your total time for the leaderboard. By creating an account a player can be saved to the Cruis'n Club, saving their name, photograph, and upgrades to any cars, although every car in the game is upgraded individually.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "January 1, 2017", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Raw Thrills", "publishers": "Raw Thrills", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/142682"}
