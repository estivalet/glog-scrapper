{"name": "Zaviga", "overview": "Zaviga was produced by Data East in 1984.<br><br>A vertical shooter tank game.<br><br>Zaviga is a top view vertical shooter with the screen scrolling upwards constantly, though the screen does scroll to the left or the right when you move in that direction. You start the game as a tank and you must drive along blasting and throwing bombs along the floor of a huge canyon with different routes that can be taken. A sight in front of your tank shows you where the bombs are going to land. Your tank has the ability to turn into a jet fighter at any time which enables you to fly over the canyon and blast and bomb the aliens. At certain points of the game you will encounter bosses which are huge cannons in the sides of the canyon and these need destroying to progress further in the game. If you are hit by an alien, its weapon, or hit the canyon walls as a tank, you lose one of three lives. Two players can play and each player takes it in turns to play when the other player is killed.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Data East Corporation", "publishers": "Data East Corporation", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.94", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xU8ZZsr3Fcc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40261"}
