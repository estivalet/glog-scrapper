{"name": "Mad Crasher", "overview": "Mad Crasher was produced by SNK in 1984.<br><br>Drive a futuristic motorbike along a diagonally scrolling road, leap gaps, shoot other cars, get the bonuses and power-ups.<br><br>Race along futuristic roads suspended in mid-air in this top-right, diagonally-scrolling road-shooter. Leap gaps in the road for bonuses, get power-ups and ram other cars and shoot everything. The music is really horrible, but the graphics are passable, although some of the parallax background scrolling looks nice. Not particularly memorable as a classic.
