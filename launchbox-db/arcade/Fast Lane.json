{"name": "Fast Lane", "overview": "Fast Lane is a top down full screen maze game where you must drive a car over various levels with two road colours and change one of the road colours to match the main road colour. As you drive and change the road colour there is another vehicle roaming the maze trying to destroy you. You are unable to turn around so you must carefully use the gaps in the walls because if you are touched by the other vehicle then you lose one of three lives. Also on screen are people and if you run them over then you receive one of six power-ups which include jump, shoot and attack. Attack turns your car into an armoured vehicle which allows you to ram the other vehicle. You are also able to speed up and slow down your vehicle and once the whole road is the same colour then you move to the next level.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.08", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=2OfQ6BenNHY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/36164"}
