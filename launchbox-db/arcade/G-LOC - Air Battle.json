Pilot your G-LOC fighter to victory against the guerillas. Only you have the skills to get the job done and save the day!<br><br>G-LOC: Air Battle (G-LOC meaning \"G-force induced Loss Of Consciousness\") is a 1990 air combat simulator arcade game developed by Sega AM2 for the Sega Y Board hardware. It is a spiritual sequel to After Burner II, featuring similar gameplay ideas and some recycled sound effects, though has always been publicly advertised as a different game entirely. The original arcade version runs on more advanced Sega Y Board hardware, and makes heavy use of sprite scaling & rotation and pre-rendered 3D graphics, anticipating the look of early texture-mapped 3D polygons.<br><br>G-LOC is notable for being one of the first video games to offer an R360 arcade cabinet which could rotate 360 degrees on all three axes, immersing the player in the action. These versions of the game are sometimes referred to as G-LOC R360, though the gameplay itself is identical.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "July 27, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.06", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58JKeizTZF0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/31158"}
