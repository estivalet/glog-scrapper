{"name": "Super Bagman", "overview": "Super Bagman was produced by French company Valadon Automation in 1984. The game was published under license by Stern Electronics in North America. <br><br>Your character is a robber. Run around a mine collecting moneybags and depositing them in a wheelbarrow at the top of the screen. Climb ladders and ride elevators to avoid two angry miners. Grab pickaxes and other objects to temporarily stun your pursuers.<br><br>The character you control in this game is Bagman, an escaped convict in a stripped suit. His goal is to steal all the bags of gold from a mine, haul the gold to the surface and deposit his loot into his wheel-barrow. Bagman must avoid two cops who have been ordered to protect the mine, prevent the gold from being stolen and stop Bagman at all costs.<br><br>Unlike the original game, this sequel has more variations. The mine has stairs that can be climbed down, an escalator to ride as well as an elevator. There is a Gunsmith's room with six-shot guns and bombs that Bagman can pick up and use. There is even another convict, Bagman's friend,locked in a dungeon in the mine which Bagman can free for an extra life.<br><br>The mine is three screens wide and scrolls as you move around. You must grab a bag of gold and carry it up to the surface and place it into the wheel-barrow before the bonus timer runs out. Whenever a bag of gold is being carried, Bagman will only walk half his normal speed, allowing the cops to easily catch up to him.<br>Since evading the policemen is of primary importance, the following are some ways to actively disable your pursuers. If you are carrying a bag of gold while climbing a ladder, the bag can be dropped on the cop's head. Hitting a policeman with a pick-axe will stun him. Shooting the gun at or placing an exploding bomb next to a cop will also stop him for a few moments.<br><br>Alternatively, passive techniques of avoiding the policemen can also be effective. The pick-axe can be used to dig a big hole in a wall or you can use a bomb to destroy the wall. Bagman can jump into or out of a mine cart by grabbing a handle on a tunnel roof as the cart passes underneath, but he must be careful to not come into contact with these carts in any other way, otherwise he will lose a life. The escalator or evelvator can also be used to elude the cops and, when transporting gold, will help Bagman reach the surface quicker.<br><br>Most bags of gold are yellow, but there is a blue bonus bag that is behind a wall. The wall can only be penetrated by a pick-axe or a bomb. Even so, the bonus blue bag of gold is twice as heavy as the standard yellow bags of gold, but it is also worth a greater amount of points.<br><br>If you free the imprisoned convict from the dungeon in the mine using a pick-axe or a bomb, you will receive an extra life.<br><br>The game can be incredibly frustrating to play and suffers from some dubious collision detection.
