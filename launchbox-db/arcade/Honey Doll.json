{"name": "Honey Doll", "overview": "Honey Doll is a adult puzzle game based on Dharma D\u014dj\u014d. The objective is to clear the stage of all blocks on screen by matching identical blocks underneath the platform. The number of consecutive matching blocks you have to put together increases as the stages advance. Matching blocks of the same kind reveal letters that float to the top of the screen. Grab enough of these to spell \"Go Honey\" and you can play one of the three different bonus stages. Unlike Dharma D\u014dj\u014d where only the leftmost block of the row could be knocked, in this game you can punch blocks from both sides. Clearing the stages reveal pictures of naked women (this feature can be turned off via a DIP switch setting).", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Barko", "publishers": "Barko", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.9", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elxWlFW2dSM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/36772"}
