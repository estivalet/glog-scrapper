{"name": "Hog Wild", "overview": "A chase oriented driving game where the player assumes the role of a cop who attempts to arrest motorcycle-riding criminals. The game has four selectable characters, each with their own vehicles and three selectable courses: Easy, Medium and Hard. The object of the game is to arrest a quota of criminals and cross the finish line before time runs out. The player arrests criminal motorcyclists by ramming his or her car into them from the left or rear. Every arrest adds time as well as to the car's turbo gauge. When the gauge reaches maximum, the vehicle can pull the turbo lever and use either the all or half of the gauge. After three course are completed, the player can be one of the motorcyclists in a special bonus course.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "2003", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Uniana", "publishers": "Uniana", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0uo9Fm9Qnc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/143520"}
