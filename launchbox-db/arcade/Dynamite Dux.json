{"name": "Dynamite Dux", "overview": "Side-scrolling beat 'em ups in which you must rescue a trapped female friend are nothing unusual. Where this one stands out, however, is the setting of your character as a duck called Bin, and with motion having a clear waddling appearance. The enemies to fight are all from the animal kingdom, but somewhat warped - crocodiles with boxing moves and cows armed with rocket packs for example. Bin has six levels to clear before he can rescue Lucy from Archaca's clutches.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.62", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNk12p9vIlg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/29060"}
