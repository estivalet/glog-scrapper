{"name": "Super Speed Race Jr.", "overview": "Super Speed Race Jr. is a racing arcade game that was released by Taito Corporation in 1985 only in Japan; it is the seventh and final title in their Speed Race series. The player must use a steering wheel to take up control of a car, with a single pedal to make it accelerate. The car in question is coloured red and you must guide it through the streets of a city while avoiding other CPU-controlled cars (one of which is a yellow Volkswagen Buggy), and trying not to go off the road; you will also have to watch out for zebra and level crossings as pedestrians and diesel-hauled trains pass over them.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Taito", "publishers": "Taito", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/39354"}
