{"name": "Operation Bear", "overview": "his bootleg of \"Operation Wolf\" proved popular as a game in its own right and even outscored the original in location tests. The reason? The lightgun on Operation Bear was a free roaming replica machine gun on a chain, which could be carried more realistically than the mounted joystick of Operation Wolf. <br><br>Due to the fact that this game has a detached hand-held machinegun, the game is more interesting than the original Operation Wolf with its fixed mount machinegun. Even in arcades where both versions were present, people usually preferred the bootleg since it was more exciting to hold a large machinegun in your hands and move it around freely. This also made the game easier as it allowed the player to reduce the distance from the gun to the screen.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bear Corporation Korea", "publishers": "Bear Corporation Korea", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=Rso-SQGgUSQ&feature=emb_logo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/132705"}
