{"name": "Speed Coin", "overview": "The objective is to roll the coin to the bottom of the screen and through the hole at the bottom by tilting the coin's platform. This must be done without breaking the coin, and within the shortest time possible. If this is done above certain times, the player gets a bonus multiplier (either 4, 2, or 1) depending on which of the 3 times the player's finishing time is above or equal to. It seems simple, but is super addictive and really fun to play with a group of people.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "2019", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Stern Electronics", "publishers": "Stern Electronics", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/118432"}
