{"name": "19XX: The War Against Destiny", "overview": "A modern airplane shooter. This is the final game in the 194X series. The graphics are great, the big airplanes are tough but with a super weapon, you will stand a chance.<br><br>You can choose between 3 fighters, each of which has a different mix of speed, default weapon-power, and homing weapon-power.<br><br>SHOOT is for the primary weapons, and BOMB controls a limited number of special weapons you can get extra by collecting powerups. During the game, if you hold down SHOOT for a short time, a power-shot missile will be released and whatever it hits will be \"locked\" for a period of time or until it is destroyed. While the target is \"locked\", you will fire extra weapons that automatically home in on the locked target.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "December 7, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Capcom", "publishers": "Capcom", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.23", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxPl26yF-tU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2306"}
