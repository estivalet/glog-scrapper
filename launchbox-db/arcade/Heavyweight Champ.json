{"name": "Heavyweight Champ", "overview": "Heavyweight Champ is a boxing game that's a spiritual sequel to the identically named arcade title released by Sega in 1976.<br><br>That game was a monochrome, side-view boxing game, but in this title, the perspective changes to camera behind our player (a boxer).The arcade cabinet has a lever for each hand (left-right). To play, you can hit or defend with both hands and move from side to side. <br><br>To use your fists, the system uses a controller rod that measures 3 vertical positions: low-medium-high. Some of the possible moves are hooks, uppercut and straight jab.<br><br>Heavyweight Champ challenges the player to win and defend the title of the Heavyweight Championship. Our protagonist is called Kid \"K.O.\" Crusher and the 4 adversaries are: Sammy \"Smasher\" Smith, Jerry \"Cyclone\" Charger, George \"Iceberg\" Cooler and the champion Willie \"Vulture\" Wilson. <br><br>There are 3 levels of difficulty and we start on the left of the screen, the blue corner, and our opponent on the right side, the red corner. There are two indicators of energy (player is blue, enemy is red) that will deplete based on the hits given or received. <br><br>Each round lasts three minutes to knock out our opponent. You can make our opponent groggy or cause a KO. The player can only rise after being downed 3 times, otherwise, it's game over.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.81", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/29538"}
