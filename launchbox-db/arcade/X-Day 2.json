{"name": "X-Day 2", "overview": "X-Day 2 (\u30a8\u30af\u30b9\u30c7\u30a42, lit. Ekusu-Dei Ts\u016b), is a quiz arcade game that was released by Namco in 1995 only in Japan; it was the last game to run on the company's NA-1 hardware, and as the name implies, it is the sequel to X-Day, which was released two years earlier. However, as with its predecessor, not much is known about it (apart from the facts that it utilized two eight-way joysticks and two buttons as evidenced by the photograph of its cabinet below) - and even though it is emulated in MAME, it is the only one of the eleven Namco NA-1 games that is classed as not working properly and is unplayable.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Quiz", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40232"}
