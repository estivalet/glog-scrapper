{"name": "Maximum Force", "overview": "Maximum Force is a light gun shooter arcade game developed by Mesa Logic for Atari Games in 1997. In 1998, Atari Games re-released the game as part of one machine called Area 51/Maximum Force Duo that also included Area 51, and later ported the game to both the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn game consoles.<br><br>Like its predecessor Area 51, Maximum Force is notable for its use of digitized video stored on an on-board hard disk, and the bizarrely contrasting unrealistic gibs into which every enemy blows apart when shot, in exactly the same way. While enemies, innocents, and explosions are 2D digitized video sprites, the levels and vehicles are pre-rendered in 3D.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mesa Logic", "publishers": "Atari Games", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.72", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/W3hQ9feh7u4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/34070"}
