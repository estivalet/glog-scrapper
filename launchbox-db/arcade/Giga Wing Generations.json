{"name": "Giga Wing Generations", "overview": "GigaWing Generations is the third game in the series, preceded by Giga Wing and Giga Wing 2. This one has no characters to pilot the 4 selectable planes and no story line. Each ship varies in ability more drastically than they do in previous Giga Wing games including flight speed and shot type. The player now selects which stage (out of two) to tackle first (in previous Giga Wings the plane choice affected the starting stage). It's also the first game in the series to use a vertically aligned monitor.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "2004", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/36424"}
