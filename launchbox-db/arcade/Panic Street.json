{"name": "Panic Street", "overview": "Panic Street is an offshoot of the Gals Panic series. It has identical gameplay: a Qix-like puzzle where you uncover an image by cutting away an overlay with a cursor. However, there is no nudity, and the cursor can move diagonally. The \"models\" in the game vary greatly, being male, female, and some not even human. They are all anime-style drawings. The gameplay is mostly identical to Gals Panic S2, released the same year.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1999", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/38036"}
