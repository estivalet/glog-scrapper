{"name": "Shadow Dancer (Mega-Tech)", "overview": "The Mega-Tech System is an arcade cabinet released by Sega in 1989, and Western counterpart to the Mega 6. It was based on the Sega Mega Drive home console, and was designed similarly to Nintendo's PlayChoice-10: players chose games from a menu of eight titles, with credits buying more play time (usually 1 minute per credit) rather than extra lives or continues; reaching a game over screen does not end the play session, and players can start over or choose a different game as long as there was some play time remaining. The Mega-Tech was not released in North America, though did see use in Asia and the PAL regions.<br><br>The master of stealth and the death-dealing art of Shuriken returns to avenge the murder of his friend Kato. The ultimate evil is Sauros, a crazed reptilian monster with the power to invoke cataclysmic catastrophes. His army of vicious ninja controls the city as he summons sudden firestorms, earthquakes and avalanches! Lizard henchmen guard terrified hostages that you must rescue. Dodge through the inferno! Hurl yourself across crumbling buildings. Conjure up total devastation with powerful ninja magic. Heave an onslaught of Death Stars - the last things the evil ones see! Shinobi's fearless attack dog Yamato joins your race through danger. He combines the strength of three men, razor jaws, and the speed of a Shinobi Sabre. You're Shadow Dancer. They've dishonored you. They die!", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/127801"}
