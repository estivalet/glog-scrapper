{"name": "Toggle", "overview": "A shoot 'em up where the player and the computer duel in a well/arena in tanks, where the red tank shoots vertically and the yellow tank shoots horizontally. A level is won by beating the computer in the amount of squares claimed. A square is claimed by running over it with the tank, where it turns the color of the tank that ran over it. There are special items that reverse the squares claimed by the player and computer, other ones that fill an entire row of squares with the color of the tank that got the bonus, and others that speed up the tanks' speed. The player has to have more squares claimed at the time the race/duel ends, and can disable the computer's tank by shooting it up close or by smashing into it at the sides that don't have the cannons.<br><br>Trivia:<br>This game is a prototype and was never released.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "2019", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bally Sente", "publishers": "Sente Systems, Inc.", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/118434"}
