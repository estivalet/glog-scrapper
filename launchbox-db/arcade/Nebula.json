{"name": "Nebula", "overview": "This game is a vertical scrolling shoot 'em up where the player controls a ship that has to shoot down alien ships. The enemies are Rava, Canda, Munda, Naga, Garda, and each one is worth a different amount of points. The first to appear are Rava, Canda, and Munda. They eventually break their formation & begin to attack. Naga & Garda eventually show up to join them. Canda & Munda start spinning wildly after the player shoots them once. Extra points are awarded for shooting them again & destroy them.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/11828"}
