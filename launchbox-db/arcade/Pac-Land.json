{"name": "Pac-Land", "overview": "Pac-Land (\u30d1\u30c3\u30af\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9?) is an entry in the Pac-Man series of arcade video games, released into arcades by Namco, and its American distributor Bally Midway (now Midway Games), in 1984. It was the first Namco arcade game to use the then-new arcade system later titled as Namco Pac-Land. It was also one of the earlier side-scrolling platform games in video game history, preceding the better-known Super Mario Bros. by Nintendo. Pac-Land features parallax scrolling for some of the background elements, a feature that would not become commonplace until the 16-bit console era began much later.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Namco", "publishers": "Midway Games", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.62", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9-dT8NJRdo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/8409"}
