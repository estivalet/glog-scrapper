{"name": "Bio Attack", "overview": "A shoot-em-up where you fight devil-like creatures while trying to save a person's body.<br><br>In this shooter, you pilot a microscopic ship through a human body. As you cruise through the bloodstream, you shoot down little devils that throw arrows at you - only 2 bullets can be onscreen at a time. If you move forward, the screen will scroll faster. This is necessary because you have a time limit/oxygen bar that will cost you one life if it runs out. You can pick up oxygen capsules to refill the timer. After this level, you defeat a bacterium inside the heart. After a second bloodstream segment where you shoot small dividing blobs, you destroy a virus inside the stomach. Then you fly through a third bloodstream level with hard-to-shoot bugs. Finally, you go through a maze inside the eyeball. The game appears to loop after this.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/35188"}
