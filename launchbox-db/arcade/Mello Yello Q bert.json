{"name": "Mello Yello Q*bert", "overview": "Mello Yello Q*Bert is a rare variant of the arcade version of Q*Bert released in 1982. Only ever given away in a sweepstakes, it is one of the rarest arcade games of all time.<br><br>The game plays almost identical to the original Q*Bert, but with intermissions added after a few levels (similar to Pac-Man). These show Q*Bert drinking a giant can of Mello Yello while slurping sound effects play. The title screen is also changed.<br><br>When the sweepstakes had been released, Gotlieb released a competition along with it, named \"Q*Bert's Snout-Out.\" If you finished the game 10 times, and sent a picture of the animation of Q*Bert drinking the Mello Yello can, you would get 5 cases of Mello Yello.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.38", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/37589"}
