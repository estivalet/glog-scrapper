{"name": "Operation Wolf 3", "overview": "Operation Wolf 3 is an on rails shooter for one or two players, and it is a sequel to Operation Wolf and Operation Thunderbolt only in name. The shooting gallery gameplay is similar but all graphics are now digitized and it has a counter-terrorist storyline instead of a military theme.<br><br>The players take on the role of two agents of the Gun Metal Army, codenamed \"Hornet\" and \"Queen Bee\", who are sent to a remote island to take out a terrorist organization called SKULL and disarm their nuclear missile.<br><br>Players fight their way through 5 levels, or scenes as the game calls them: a factory, an expressway, a city wasteland, the tower of the terrorists and finally the nuclear missile. At the end of each scene the game warns you \"Emergency here comes super weapon\" and there is a boss fight with helicopter, a tank, a jet fighter and a flying robot. Between levels there sometimes is an extra scene with target practice, where the player must shoot targets, bottles and skeet discs for bonus points.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "East Technology", "publishers": "Taito", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "2.46", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1Uen25j7lg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/37962"}
