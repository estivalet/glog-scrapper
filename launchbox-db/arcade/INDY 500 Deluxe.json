The game was AM1's second project using 3D computer graphics, after 1994's Wing War. According to Nakagawa, Indy 500 was the first time AM1 was able to develop color textures and gave the team experience in developing games in 3D.

He praised the game's high quality graphics and effective simulation of the unique qualities of IndyCar racing, though he also remarked that the infrequency of powerslides makes the game less fun. French magazine Player One\u00a0[fr] praised the game's graphics and stated that Indy 500 continued a racing tradition with Sega that began with Virtua Racing and continued with Daytona USA and Sega Rally Championship. A reviewer for Computer and Video Games compared the game to Daytona USA and stated that Indy 500 is a more realistic game, but lacks in both graphics and gameplay compared to Daytona and Rave Racer. Reviewing the game for Sega Pro, Steve Hardy expressed disappointment that Indy 500's course selection offered nothing out of the ordinary. He gave praise to the game's graphics, but suggested that players play Sega Rally Championship instead for more excitement.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega Enterprises Ltd.", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "8", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.86", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ua4ZfqopTyw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/36856"}
