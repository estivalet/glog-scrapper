{"name": "Anti-Aircraft", "overview": "Anti-Aircraft is a two-player arcade game by Atari, Inc, originally released in 1975. <br><br>Atari's Anti-Aircraft puts you and a friend behind a pair anti-aircraft guns. Bomber planes appear from multiple directions at random. They can appear alone or in pairs. Your goal is to shoot down more bombers than the other player within the set time limit. Use your three buttons -- up, down and fire -- to aim at and gun down the enemy planes. the up and down buttons tilt your gun to predetermined positions rather than letting you make precise movements. While the game is run using no CPUs and the PCB is composed entirely of discrete circuitry, the sprites are stored in ROM.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "June 6, 1975", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atari", "publishers": "Atari", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.77", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ18iqEf7ZQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/34960"}
