While out on a boat tour around the island, pirates being chased by sharks crash into their boat and try to commandeer it. The two are thrown overboard and wash ashore on a tropical island, where the local wildlife has gone crazy. Beth and Zack must work together if they hope to escape the island.<br><br>The game follows many of the same conventions as the original games, mixing arcade shooting with Press X to Not Die segments with a few control tweaks.
