{"name": "Warzaid", "overview": "In World Combat (also known by the name Warzaid) players play as an army soldier, or up to 4 players can play as a platoon as they are thrown into the chaos of a war that features soldiers, flamethrowers, tanks and skeletons.<br><br>There are 10 missions as well as 4 challenges, including preventing the enemy from crossing a special border, shooting down all of the missiles, and destroying all the tanks. Each mission has a time limit that varies between 3 minutes and 6 minutes, with a boss at the end of each. This game is different to the other games produced by other companies in that if you do not complete the mission before the time limit ends, each player losses a life instead of the game ending. Each player also competes against others in the platoon as players get promoted when passing a certain score from a leutenant to a field general. The player with the highest rank at the end of each mission gets an extra life.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "2002", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhkoxQq4yeE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40200"}
