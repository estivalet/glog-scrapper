{"name": "Skull & Crossbones", "overview": "Fight as either Red Beard or One Eye through various pirate themed levels, like ships and forts, and even some non-pirate themed levels, battling ninjas, skeletons, and others in a quest to get back your hard earned money from an evil wizard. You can also fight side by side with a friend (who controls the pirate you didn't choose).<br><br>Fighting works like fencing, with a few different moves to use, including parrying. The levels scroll through with a boss at the end of each. You gain money by vanquishing foes and digging for treasure where X marks the spot.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atari Games", "publishers": "Atari Games", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.04", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvoliahWrK8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/38903"}
