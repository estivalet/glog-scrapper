{"name": "Up'n Down", "overview": "FUN IN THE FAST LANE Drive your Baja Buggy over treacherous miles of deadly motocross track. Watch out! The course is crawling with opponents who want to make this the last race you run. Beware of killer pick-up trucks, boulders, and swarms of other motoring menaces. Multiple screeching screens of Baja Road Race excitement. - High-speed challenges for one or two players. - Full-throttle color action-animated graphics.<br><br>The object is to drive around a twisty course and collect all the colored flags. You can jump over gaps and over or onto other cars. If you land on another car, you destroy it and collect points. You can also collect things like balloons and ice cream cones for bonus points. The faster you collect all the flags, the bigger a time bonus you get.<br><br>In later levels, there are dead-ends or gaps and a vehicle that is carrying a flag you need, so you will need to jump on it. If you are hit by another vehicle or go off the course, you lose a life. Two player games are alternating with the players taking their turns.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "September 13, 1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega Enterprises Ltd.", "publishers": "Sega Enterprises Ltd.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.93", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9SK2aDgQxY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/39924"}
