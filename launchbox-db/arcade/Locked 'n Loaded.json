{"name": "Locked 'n Loaded", "overview": "An agency is dedicated to stopping worldwide terrorism. There are six stages, which can be played in any order. Players use lightguns to shoot down terrorists throughout each stage, which is made up of several areas including one with a boss enemy. The player had five health points which are deducted either when hit by a projectile or after shooting down an innocent bystander. The standard weapon is an 8-bullet handgun with infinite ammo. Reloading the weapon requires the player to tap the bottom of the lightgun. Better weapons such as Magnum Pistols and Grenade Guns can be collected, but come with limited ammo and reloads. In addition to the main game, there are also shooting range stages and competitive mini-games.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Data East", "publishers": "Data East", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/37203"}
