{"name": "Power-Up Baseball", "overview": "Midway had worked on a baseball game in the NBA Jam lineage. The game used the same photo capture technology as NBA Jam, had similarly exaggerated movement, and a charismatic announcer of its own (in this case, White Sox legend \u201cHawk\u201d Harrelson). It was a collaboration between NBA Jam creator Midway Games and Golden Tee Golf creator Incredible Technologies, attempting to combine the best of both worlds.<br><br>Cabinets were made and put out for test briefly in the Chicago area before the game was quietly canceled. With the exception of those few players who happened to play it at the time, the game was never seen, until programmer Chris Oberth's archive of the game was obtained in 2021.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "", "developers": "Midway Games", "publishers": "", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhpi9OKd3JQ&feature=emb_title&ab_channel=TheVideoGameHistoryFoundation", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/149340"}
