{"name": "Time Pilot '84", "overview": "Time Pilot '84: Further Into Unknown World is an eight-way scrolling shoot 'em up, released in 1984 by Konami. It is the sequel to Time Pilot. The player pilots a craft over many time periods. Unlike the original which told the year of each level, the new time periods are designated by new enemies and different colors.<br><br>There are a large number of enemy types in the game. They each have varying movement patterns, difficulty, and point values. The first button is used to fire a standard shot, which can destroy green-colored enemies. The second button is used to fire missiles, which can destroy the silver-colored enemies. You need to lock on to a silver enemy to fire missiles at it. Destroying enough green enemies brings out a large silver \"boss\" enemy that must be dispatched before advancing to the next level.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.84", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-EJ5ZZfYXk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/39674"}
