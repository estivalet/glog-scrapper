{"name": "Star Castle", "overview": "You control a ship that fires at a cannon surrounded by three oppositely rotating energy rings of twelve segments each. When a clear line of fire is open, the cannon fires back at your ship with a big \"fuzzball\". Three sparks start off on the rings, but eventually fly loose and chase the player's ship. <br><br>In 1981, Zaccaria licensed a clone of Star Castle and released as Space Fortress. Century Electronics also released an arcade title in 1981 as Space Fortress, but it is unrelated to Zaccaria's Star Castle clone.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "September 1, 1980", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Cinematronics", "publishers": "Cinematronics", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.86", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HHRCA6CS8k", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/12392"}
