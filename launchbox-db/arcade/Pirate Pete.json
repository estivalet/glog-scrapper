{"name": "Pirate Pete", "overview": "Pirate Pete is a reworked version of \"Jungle King/Jungle Hunt\". Here's what makes Pirate Pete different from Jungle King/Jungle Hunt:<br><br>* An opening musical theme is used in certain parts of the game instead of the opening Tarzan yell (unlike in \"Jungle Hunt\", it is NOT the same one used at the end of the ocean stage).<br>* The player character is a heroic pirate instead of the Tarzan character.<br>* In the first stage, the player swings on ropes between ship's masts instead of vines between trees.<br>* The second stage is set in an ocean infested with sharks, instead of a river infested with alligators and crocodiles.<br>* The third stage adds a new enemy - snakes. They appear at the top of the screen and will kill the player if he touches them while jumping.<br>* The enemies in the fourth stage are sword-wielding pirates instead of spear-chucking cannibals.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Taito", "publishers": "Taito", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm0gHKgGYa0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/38132"}
