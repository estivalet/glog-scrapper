{"name": "Snow Bros.: Nick & Tom", "overview": "Two snowmen, Nick and Tom, battle cute Japanese critters over 50 platform based screens. Turn the enemy critters into snowballs and then boot them around the platforms knocking down everything in their path. Pick up Sushi for exra points. When a screen is cleared of monsters you move on to the next level.<br><br>Shoot snow at monsters to turn them into snowballs. Press the fire button next to a snowball to kick it around the screen. Any monsters hit by a snowball are killed. If another snowball is hit, it too bounces around the screen. Collect potions for power ups.<br>Yellow = Long shot<br>Red      = Speed up<br>Blue     = \"Big\" snow encases monsters quicker<br>Green  = Inflates you like a ballon and lets you fly around the screen killing any monsters you touch. May only appear at certain times.<br><br>Killing all the monsters on a level with a single snowball causes money bonuses, worth 10,000 points, to fall down, but sometimes a glowing cake bonus will appear instead. When the cake is collected, the game stops and four blue snowball creatures appear for a short time. If these enemies are killed, they each provide a letter: \"S\",\"N\",\"O\" or \"W\". Collect all four of these letters for an extra life. The glowing cake can also appear at other times during the game.<br><br>Very cute cartoon-like characters and animation and a nice sound track. Although a 1990 game it really has a feel of the earlier abstract games along the lines of Mr. Do!, etc.. Very similar in style to Bubble Bobble.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "ToaPlan", "publishers": "Romstar", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.04", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9t_1YDsxyrY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/38949"}
