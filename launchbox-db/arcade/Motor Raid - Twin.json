{"name": "Motor Raid: Twin", "overview": "Motor Raid (\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30ec\u30a4\u30c9) is a Sega Model 2 arcade game by Sega AM1. It is a racing game, in which the player rides futuristic motorbikes across different planets. The player can also hit his/her opponents. Most (if not all) Motor Raid units were sold as conversion kits for Manx TT Super Bike, making this game somewhat rare. The twin cabinet version is the standard version of the game. Up to 4 \"twin\" cabinets may be linked together for 8 player gameplay.<br><br>The Deluxe (\"DX\") version has only a single rider cabinet but a larger monitor. The \"DX\" and \"twin\" cabinets can not be linked.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "October 1, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega AM1", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "8", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.96", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/jjVz3Ket3pI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/37730"}
