{"name": "Carrier Air Wing", "overview": "This is a side-scrolling shooter with power-ups and special weapons. You can buy the special weapons and things like energy and shields at the beginning of a stage. You gain money by shooting enemies.<br><br>The 1990s was a decade of great change marked by growing friendships between old enemies and never before seen levels of co-operation between powerful nations of the world. However, in 1997, using new weapons designed in secrecy, the Middle Eastern country of Rabu threatened to destroy this fragile peace. Rabu's proported goal is to purge the world of sin and force a new morality, with her allies. Rabu quickly claimed the Middle East, then spread into both southern Asia and parts of Europe. Their weaponery is terrifyingly eeficient at manufacturing death. They seemed unstoppable. When they gassed Tokyo in 1999, U.S. intervention became unavoidable. If Rabu is allowed to use Japan's manufacturing facilities, there will be no end to the nightmare. Hoping to protect world peace, the USS Carl Vinson (CVN-70) heads out to the sea.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "October 30, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Capcom", "publishers": "Capcom", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.91", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ev1rgJm6uWw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/11699"}
