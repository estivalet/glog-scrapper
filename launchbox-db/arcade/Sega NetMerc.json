It is the only game created for the Sega Net Merc (\u30bb\u30ac \u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30de\u30fc\u30af) system (a Sega Model 1 arcade board adapted for virtual reality), so the two are often used interchangably.<br><br>Dennou Senki Net Merc is an on-rails shoot-'em-up game, in which players use a large gun controller to fire at enemies. Being a virtual reality game, players are also given a VR headset (a \"MVD\" or \"Mega Visor Display\", similar to those found in the VR-1), allowing for their head movements to be tracked in real time and therefore see a full 360 degree view of their surroundings.<br><br>Players are always stood facing in one direction behind the gun controller during gameplay. The complex nature of the system means that a member of staff was usually on hand to assist users with the headset.<br><br>The Sega Net Merc system consists of a Mega Visor Display being attached to a 3SPACE ISOTRAK II head and motion tracker and a specialised cabinet.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega Corporation", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/37833"}
