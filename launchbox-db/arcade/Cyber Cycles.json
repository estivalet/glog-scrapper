The CPU-controlled green motorcycles in the game are also based on the cycles from 1992's Suzuka 8 Hours, and there are two different circuits to choose from (Green Hill, which is named after one of the circuits of 1993's Suzuka 8 Hours 2 and aimed at novice players, and Neo Yokohama, which is aimed at expert ones) along with seven background music tracks (four on both circuits, but the fourth for both is \"New Music\"); there's even a Ridge Racer-style view change button that allows players to switch from third-person to first-person view (and back again), and four different best-time tables (two for each circuit, with the first being for solo play, and the second being for link play).", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Namco", "publishers": "Namco", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.55", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCLdg6RO-GU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/33838"}
