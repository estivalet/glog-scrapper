{"name": "Ambush", "overview": "Ambush is a game for one or two players taking turns. The player controls a space ship shown using a behind view with the goal to survive as long as possible fighting waves of enemies. The game has two sequences. In the first one the space ship needs to be launched. It sits on a runway and needs to reach a certain speed before the take-off can be activated, launching the ship in the air. The player needs to gently press left or right to prevent the ship from touching the borders and slowing down. When the ship does not reach the required speed, the end of the runway is reached, or the take-off action is not activated, then the ship crashes and the game is over right away before a single shot is fired.<br><br>Once the ship is in the air the shooting starts. The ship needs to dodge asteroids and defeat all enemies that come into view, using a unlimited amount of bullets and with gameplay similar to Space Harrier. A radar in the top right corner can be used to scout incoming enemies to line them up accurately in the cross-hairs.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nippon Amuse", "publishers": "Nippon Amuse", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBatBbaB6Eo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/28832"}
