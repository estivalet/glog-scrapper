{"name": "Ironman Ivan Stewart's Super Off-Road Track-Pak", "overview": "Ironman Ivan Stewart's Super Off Road Track Pak was produced by Leland in 1989.<br><br>This game is almost exactly the same as the original except that it has eight brand-new tracks which are Shortcut, Cut-off Pass, Pig Bog, Rio Trio, Leapin' Lizards, Redoubt About, Boulder Hill and Volcano Valley.<br>Like in the original game, \"Ironman\" Ivan Stewart drives the white, computer-controlled truck. During the demo play or whenever other players are not in the game, the red truck is driven by \"Steamin'\" Steve High, the yellow truck is driven by \"Hot Rod\" John Rowe and the blue truck is driven by \"Jammin'\" John Morgan.<br><br>Another major difference is that before each player begins the game, they each can select their vehicle that they will each race in to be either a dune buggy or a truck. The dune buggy has better shocks and acceleration while the truck has better traction and top speed.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.73", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/36887"}
