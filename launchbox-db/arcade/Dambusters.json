{"name": "Dambusters", "overview": "In this game you control a bomber which flies over a horizontally scrolling landscape whilst shooting enemy planes and ground targets. The dam must be destroyed by a well-timed strike with a bouncing bomb.<br><br>Each mission involves flying the bomber over the English Channel, over Germany, dropping the bouncing bomb on the Dam, flying back over Germany and the English Channel, and finally landing safely in England. As you approach the target, the enemy planes attack more frequently and accurately. As well as the threat of being shot down, the player could also run out of fuel during the mission, ending the game. The game scrolls from left to right on the way to the target, and from right to left on the return leg. The button to release the bomb is as a thumb-trigger on the joystick. To accurately hit the target, the player has to fly at a particular height, achieved by matching the positions of two targeting points, and release the bomb at a set distance from the wall of the dam. This proves very difficult.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "GAT", "publishers": "GAT", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.77", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faau39tiyKU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/35765"}
