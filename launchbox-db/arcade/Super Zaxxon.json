{"name": "Super Zaxxon", "overview": "Super Zaxxon is a three-quarter perspective, space shooter style game. You must first go over a base on an asteroid. Things located on this base include gun implacements, fuel tanks, radar stations, missiles, and fighters. After you successfully navigate this base, you will go through a tunnel to tangle with enemy fighters, mine layers, and mines. You then will have to navigate through a series of barriers on another asteroid in order to take on the Super Zaxxon's, the enemy robot dragons.<br><br>The game is very similar in appearance to Zaxxon. The differences are:<br><br>-   Your fighter moves much faster. This makes going after ground targets a big challenge.<br><br>-   The graphics are different. Although this is more of a viewing difference, it can still change ones perspective after they have gotten used to the Zaxxon graphics.<br><br>-   There is no more outer space battle. Instead, you must go through a narrow tunnel to get to area 3.<br><br>-   Instead of 20 fighters, you now have to tangle with 25 fighters in area 2.<br><br>-   A new enemy, the Mine Layer, is introduced. As the name implies, this ship lays mines in your path. You can destroy the mines but it takes a few hits.<br><br>-   Instead of encountering one Zaxxon robot, you now have to deal with three Super Zaxxon, dragon looking robots.<br><br>-   The placement of things (fuel tanks, gun implacements, etc.) in areas 1 and 3 is different then in Zaxxon.<br><br>-   There are now indestructible, elevated guns in area 1. These guns sit on the right side and they are 2.5 units in altitude.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.7", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtube.com/watch?v=ul2vX8-dmTA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/12398"}
