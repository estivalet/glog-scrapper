{"name": "Qwak (prototype)", "overview": "This prototype was never released. Qwak was a '15-puzzle' game with cute animations and it shares with MM2 the distinction of using 'Motion Objects' for text. Designers were unsure whether it was originally designed for a touch-screen or not. It could have been a joystick game that happened to be in development when they were interested in evaluating touch-screen technology. They felt that the touch-screen would make a more intuitive interface, but were apparently wrong. The most common comment at the focus-group was 'could you put a joystick or buttons on it. It would be easier'...", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atari", "publishers": "Atari", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNgriimT6FU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/115020"}
