{"name": "Ghox", "overview": "A magical/horror-themed ball-and-paddle game in the vein of Arkanoid/Breakout, based around the idea of defeating an evil magician and his army of minions from the Netherworld. One or two players (two may play simultaneously) set out to destroy the infernal spirits' lair by manipulating fiery balls of magic.<br><br>Two balls are launched at a time, and must be caught and deflected to knock out all the colored blocks on each level, as well as the assorted ghosts, demons, zombies and other supernatural beings that try to impede your progress. Treasure chests can be broken for collectible score bonuses, and some blocks may unleash flying pixies, which award temporary power-ups if caught. Others release colored treasure balls - catch five in a row of the same color, and get a special power which stays active throughout the game (even after death).<br><br>Each group of stages concludes with a boss fight. Win, and you get to choose which path to proceed in, so the selection of levels may vary between games.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "June 1, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "ToaPlan", "publishers": "Toaplan", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.18", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9fuzIsZWjw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/29427"}
