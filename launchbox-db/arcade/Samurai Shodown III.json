{"name": "Samurai Shodown III", "overview": "Samurai Shodown III was to be the start of a bold new direction for the franchise.<br><br>The most obvious difference between this game and the others in the series is the notably darker aesthetic. The more light-hearted characters (Earthquake, Cham Cham, and Gen-an to name a few) from the previous games have been excised, and even the kabuki master, Kyoshiro Senryo, received a redesign, transforming him from a flamboyant stage performer into a grim-faced, muscular man. All of the characters have been completely redrawn. The animation is very smooth for all characters, another departure from the graphical style of the second game.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "November 15, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "SNK", "publishers": "SNK", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.03", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/26078"}
