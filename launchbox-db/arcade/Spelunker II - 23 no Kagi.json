{"name": "Spelunker II: 23 no Kagi", "overview": "The arcade sequel to Spelunker that closely retains the game mechanics and style of the first arcade game: a descent into a perilous underworld, this time greenish instead of an earthly brown, populated by strange denizens and even stranger traps and hazards. As you proceed towards the unknown depths of the mine shaft, there will be plenty of platform jumping, rope climbing, dynamite blasting, key hunting, ghost-busting and other routine speleological activities. Naturally, there's no shortage of treasure and bonus items, and the path to the exit isn't always obvious, which will have you hunting for secret passages and seeking creative ways to modify the environment.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Micro Graphic Image", "publishers": "Irem", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.9", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/bd0HahLrAYU?t=48", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/39066"}
