{"name": "Return of the Invaders", "overview": "Return of the Invaders is the third game in Taito's Space Invaders series. It's a more radical change from the original concept than Part II and features an all new full colour look. There are several new features in the game. Most noticeable are the additions of new enemy formations, seen already in the first wave where the aliens circle around. Some aliens also, when shot, leave their positions and dive towards the player. Others can reflect the player's shots and send them back against him. The game also adds bonus stages similar to Galaga. Another new addition is that the UFOs at the top of the screen now carry weapon upgrades which they drop when shot. To get it the player needs to avoid shooting the centre of the UFO as both the UFO and the weapon will be destroyed.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "UPL Co., Ltd", "publishers": "Taito Corporation", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.42", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3uoIGieciM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/38547"}
