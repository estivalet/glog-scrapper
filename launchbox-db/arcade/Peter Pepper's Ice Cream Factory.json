{"name": "Peter Pepper's Ice Cream Factory", "overview": "In this Burger Time spinoff, the player controls the Ice-cream man Peter Pepper with the object of placing ice-cream scoops into cones. The player can also put a scoop into a cone that already has a scoop. When all scoops are in cones, the player is taken to the next Pattern. Throwing an ice-cream scoop can send it up on a platform depending on the position. Living confectioneries and utensils will try to hinder Peter's progress, but they can be taken out by pushing or throwing an ice-cream scoop directly on them. Also enemies cannot harm Peter while they/he is climbing a ladder.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Data East Corporation", "publishers": "Data East Corporation", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL_9RSPt4nU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/38081"}
