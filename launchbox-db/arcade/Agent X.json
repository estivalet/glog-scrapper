{"name": "Agent X", "overview": "Agent X must progress through a series of floors to retrieve a set of stolen plans and destroy Dr. Boom's underground bomb factory. Avoid the explosives, bomb converters, forklifts, robot guards, acid pits, and death-ray shooting eyeballs. This game is a prototype of \"Cloak & Dagger\". When the game was about 70% completed and the movie was about 40% done, the movie producers and editors came to Atari to see if Atari had a game they could film as backdrop to the movie scenes which needed a 'Cloak & Dagger like spy game'. Atari agreed to change the name of its game to \"Cloak & Dagger\" and they put a couple of tid-bits into their script which referred to 'Agent X' (Dabny Colman's character). The game actually arrived on the scene about 2 months before the movie was released. It was tested under the name 'Agent X' in it's initial field test (about 5 months before the movie was released), but was never produced as anything but \"Cloak & Dagger\". There were about 5000 games produced which made it into the market place.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Russel Dawe", "publishers": "Atari", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.85", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/117615"}
