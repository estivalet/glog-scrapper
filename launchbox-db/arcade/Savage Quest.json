{"name": "Savage Quest", "overview": "Savage Quest is a game where you play as one of the most terrifying monsters of the dinosaur age.... Tyrannosaurus Rex. The plot is simple, an evil shaman (I suppose that's who he is) has stolen your clutch of eggs... for reasons unknown... and you are on a mission to find him and rescue your eggs.<br>You encounter various enemies and bosses along the journey, including Torosaurus, Spinosaurus, Allosaurus, an armoured Apatosaurus, Styracosaurus, along with various others, while almost continuously being bombarded with attacks by smaller enemies such as Velociraptors and/or those blue guys who throw spears at you. Also if it is two bosses you are fighting at the same time, these constant assaults by those smaller enemies make it increasingly difficult to stay alive, especially if you are slowly starving to death. Long story short, basically you are trying to kill one or often two bosses, warding off smaller enemies and trying to grab something to eat to prevent yourself from starving... all at the same time. The trick is to KEEP MOVING... all this action combined with the fact that you control your T. rex via a joystick really makes your hand ache. Overall... that is the only problem I have with this game. What I really LOVE about this game, however, is the killing; you can actually hunt other dinosaurs and make your own kills. On one level, there is a herd of large plant-eating dinosaurs crossing a river, you can simply pick a target and run straight towards them. They will scatter, like wildebeests when encountered by a lion, and you can keep biting your chosen victim until it keels over and dies.<br>i", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1999", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/38720"}
