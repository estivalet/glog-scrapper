{"name": "Tornado Baseball", "overview": "The game is a very simple game of baseball, implemented with stick figures. The game is very simple in terms of rules, and anybody can pick up on how to play fairly quickly. This is a two player only title, with both people playing for a single quarter. The pitching player selects his pitch with one joystick, while moving his outfielders with a second one. The batting player only has a single button (that is a 'swing' button). Both players use the same set of controls, so they must switch spots in front of the machine midway through each inning. You get a four inning game for one quarter, although that number can be adjusted by the game operator.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "June 5, 1976", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dave Nutting Associates", "publishers": "Midway", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/-N6Gq8WJmi0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/39733"}
