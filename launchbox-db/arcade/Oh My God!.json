{"name": "Oh My God!", "overview": "Oh My God! was produced by Atlus in 1993.<br><br>Move your colored stack of pieces, which look like little demon heads, in any direction. The object of this game is to score so many points per level to pass to the next. Getting three or more colors to line up will cause the line to disappear and possibily set up chain combos.<br><br>When you clear a level, any balls left are still there when you begin the next level! (Oh My God!) The game also has funny sound effects and speech (like when you lose it will say \"Oh my God!\").<br><br>This game was released as a conversion kit only in Japan.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atlus", "publishers": "Atlus", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.28", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtxIArop9_M", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/37930"}
