{"name": "Steel Worker", "overview": "Steel Worker is an arcade game, that was released by Taito Corporation in 1980; it utilizes an Intel 8080 microprocessor (running at 2 MHz), with discrete circuitry and a Texas Instruments SN-76477 for sound. The player is cast as the chief engineer of a construction site - and he must use a 2-way joystick to select one of ten different types of girders (with a button to confirm his choice) in order to build a bridge, so that the eponymous Steel Worker may safely walk from one side of the site to the other. If the Steel Worker falls off the bridge, it will cost him a life and he will be resurrected back on that left side of the site (if he still has lives, that is); the player also has another button to reverse the direction of the Steel Worker (but it can only be used a maximum of nine times). You will receive 50 points for every girder you connect (up to a maximum of fifteen can be used for every stage), with a bonus for having the Steel Worker reach that right side of the site (100 for Stage 1, 400 for Stage 2, 200 for Stages 3 and 4, and 300 for Stages 5 and 6) - and the game can be seen as a forerunner to Psygnosis's Lemmings series, as well as Nintendo's Gumshoe, and their Japan-only Mario & Wario.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "March 1, 1980", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Taito", "publishers": "", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/39157"}
