Oil slicks and other cars could make you lose control. Ratings: Granny, Rookie, Pro. Bonus time extra 30 \"seconds\" for completing enough laps.<br><br>The gameplay is identical to that of the first title in the series, Sprint 2, which was released two years earlier, only with the removal of the second-player capability - and the tracks shall also advance automatically once the player has completed a full lap of the current one.
