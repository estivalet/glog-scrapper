{"name": "Straight Flush", "overview": "Straight Flush is a Breakout variant. The player controls a paddle at the bottom of the screen, and must bounce a ball back into the field. Instead of bricks the field is filled with card suit symbols (hearts, clubs, diamonds, spades). The symbols disappear when hit. In the top corners of the screen are cards placed diagonally which when hit will flip to reveal the sequence 10-J-Q-K-A and B-O-N-U-S. When the bonus points are gained a witch will start flying around the screen becoming a harder to predict obstacle. When the ball isn't returned a ball is lost when the player runs out of balls the game is over.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "October 1, 1979", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Taito", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.28", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/39171"}
