{"name": "The House of the Dead 4 Special", "overview": "The House of the Dead 4 Special is an arcade game that takes place shortly after The House of the Dead 4 for up to two players working cooperatively. Kate Green from the original game teams up with G to deal with another zombie infestation. This leads them to the Magician, a boss character from the first two games in the series. Next to the Magician, Justice is another boss character encountered in the game.<br><br>Just like the original title the player holds an uzi gun to attack the zombies from a first-person perspective. There are two large screens, the seats can shake and air is blown when taking damage. As a rail shooter movement is done automatically, the player only aims and shoots. Some sections of the game are done on foot and others in a vehicle. There are also moments where a branching path can be chosen and there are various cut-scenes shown from a third-person perspective. Entirely new for the series is the addition for a green life bar near the bottom of the screen, allowing for multiple hits, taking damage, before the game is over.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "July 8, 2006", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Sega WOW Inc.", "publishers": "Sega Corporation", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/142684"}
