{"name": "Winning Run Suzuka Grand Prix", "overview": "Winning Run Suzuka Grand Prix is a first-person racing arcade game, that was released by Namco in 1989; it runs upon the company's System 21 hardware, and is the second title in their Winning Run series. Up to four players can play simultaneously, when four one-player cabinets are linked together (much like in Namco's own Dirt Fox) - however, as with Final Lap, and the aforementioned \"Dirt Fox\", MAME will not support link plays if you use it to play it (and this will require version .097u1 or higher).<br><br><br>As with the original game, the players must take control of one of two cars (a blue one with automatic transmission and five different gears and a red one with manual transmission and six different gears) in order to compete in a race on the Suzuka Circuit (which is making its third appearance in a Namco game after Pole Position II and that initial Final Lap); if you are playing this game alone, your position in the race will never change from 1/1, regardless of how many cars you pass, but if up to three other people are playing and any of them are ahead of you at any time, your position will be 2/2, 3/3 or 4/4.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.71", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40152"}
