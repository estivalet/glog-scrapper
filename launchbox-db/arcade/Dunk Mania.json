{"name": "Dunk Mania", "overview": "A two-on-two basketball game played from a midcourt sideline perspective. Emphasis is on dunks. After every dunk, two replays are shown of the dunk from different camera angles. Press start to skip the replays. After every basket, the other team gets the ball at half court -- no out of bounds throw-ins.<br>Since there is no NBA license for this game, there are ten teams from US cities with names like the Orlando Gators and the Indiana Speeders.<br><br>The computer's artificial intelligence is severely lacking even on the hard levels. The computer plays little to no defense at all. There is no pushing of opponents as there is in the NBA Jam series (though there are no fouls either).<br><br>There are no quarters, no halftimes, it's just one continuous game. If you win, you get to play against the next team. You can actually beat all the teams with one credit since it lets you keep playing. Beat all the teams and you get three dunks in a slam dunk contest. Afterwards, the game ends.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Namco", "publishers": "Namco", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.78", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/33847"}
