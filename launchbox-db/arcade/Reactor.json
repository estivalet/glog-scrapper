{"name": "Reactor", "overview": "In Reactor, the player controls a space ship inside of a nuclear reactor which they are trying to stop from melting down. The reactor core at the center of the screen is surrounded by a deadly kill wall. Roaming throughout the available space are positrons, neutrinos, and photons, all of which will be trying to knock the player's ship into the wall. To survive, the player will need to knock all of these attacking particles into the kill wall to destroy them. As each level progresses, the reactor core will slowly grow in size, making less and less room for the ship to maneuver in. Eventually the reactor core will melt down; to prevent this, the player will need to destroy all of the particles before the time runs out. To help out, the ship starts the game with a limited number of decoys. When a decoy is placed on the screen, all of the particles will be attracted to it instead of the actual ship. If the player places the decoy close enough to the kill wall, this will make it easier to destroy the particles. Also inside the reactor are two sets of control rods (located on the left and right sides of the screen); If the player destroys an entire set of rods by knocking the particles into them, the reactor core will shrink down in size, giving the player more time to do battle. If both sets of rods are destroyed, the player earns an extra decoy.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gottlieb", "publishers": "Gottlieb", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.15", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/38493"}
