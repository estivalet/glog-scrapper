{"name": "Eggor", "overview": "Eggor is a multi-directional shooter arcade game, released by Telko in 1983.<br><br>It runs on Namco's Pac-Man hardware (a Zilog Z80, running at 3.072 MHz, with a Namco WSG running at 96 KHz for sound), and appears to be based on Digitrex Techstar's Eyes (which was released in that previous year). <br><br>The player must use a 4-way joystick to take up control of a baby vulture (who is the eponymous \"Eggor\") through eight different mazes and use a singular button to shoot all the eggs while getting pursued by five adult vultures - and if Eggor shoots one of them, he'll disappear (for the rest of the current round). But if one of the adult vultures shoots Eggor he will lose a life; shooting an egg is worth 500 points on the first round and increases by 250 for every subsequent round, while shooting an adult vulture (and killing him) is worth 100 points upon the first round and increases by 100 for every subsequent round.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Telko", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J2E2yWX0u0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/36070"}
