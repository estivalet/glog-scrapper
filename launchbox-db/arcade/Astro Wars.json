{"name": "Astro Wars", "overview": "Astro Wars was produced by Zaccaria in 1979. The game is a licensed clone of Data East's Astro Fighter except on worse hardware and not as good sound capabilities. Because of this, Data East's title was far more successful, and this version is not very popular at all.<br><br>Standard scrolling/shooting game with five waves of enemies that proceed down the screen. The addition of a fuel limitation adds to the urgency of the game, requiring that you eliminate all of each wave of enemies in order to make it to the final level with enough fuel.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1980", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Data East", "publishers": "Zaccaria", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.6", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/Tbe-OjDw-cc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/35004"}
