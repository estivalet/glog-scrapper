{"name": "Street Fighter: The Movie", "overview": "Street Fighter: The Movie was produced by Capcom/Incredible Technologies in 1995.<br><br>Street Fighter: The Movie (originally planned to be Street Fighter III during early development) is based on the 1994 live-action Street Fighter movie and uses digitized images of the film's cast. While a game of the same name was released for the PlayStation and Sega Saturn, it is not a port but a separately produced game based on the same movie. The arcade version of Street Fighter: The Movie differs from the previous Street Fighter II games in several ways: the game gives a greater emphasis towards air combos or \"juggling\" than previous games. The player can continuously attack their opponent while they're falling in the air with a series of attacks. Additionally, players can cancel any Special Move while performing it into another Special Move. This can even be done with projectile attacks.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "June 5, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Incredible Technologies", "publishers": "Capcom", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.43", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGav4TMW1mI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27039"}
