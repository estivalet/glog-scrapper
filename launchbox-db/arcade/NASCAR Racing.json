{"name": "NASCAR Racing", "overview": "EA Sports NASCAR Racing is an arcade racing game developed by EA Tiburon and released by Global VR. The game was released on August 3, 2007 at the AAMA Gala. Up to four racers (10 with the version 1.1 update) race against each other and the CPU in one of the major NASCAR tracks (i.e. Daytona International Speedway, Indianapolis Motor Speedway, etc.) Damage is visible but does not affect performance (until one crashes), and AI will frequently wreck. However, at the end of each race the racer receives a halo if they did not try to ram other racers and a pair of red horns if they did. The cabinet for the game supports motion feedback (but makes turning harder). The game features a selection of songs from the soundtrack of NASCAR 2005: Chase for the Cup.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "2007", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "EA Tiburon", "publishers": "Global VR", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/28769"}
