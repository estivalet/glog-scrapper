Ryuhaku Todo, the first boss in the original AOF, is the only character dropped; all characters are playable from the beginning. The final boss is always Mr. Big, though as mentioned earlier, an extra match will be played against Geese Howard if the player unlocks him through good performance.<br>This game is also notorious for its difficulty, with it being referred in many fighting circles as having some of the toughest opponent AI in a fighting game.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "February 2, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "SNK", "publishers": "SNK", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.63", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBPmfdl2iDw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/34994"}
