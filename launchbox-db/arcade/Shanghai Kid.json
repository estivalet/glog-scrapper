{"name": "Shanghai Kid", "overview": "Shanghai Kid was developed by Nihon Game (now known as Culture Brain) in 1985. It had several publishers including Taiyo System in Japan, and both Data East and Kitcorp in North America. <br><br>In Japan this game is called \"Hokuha Syourin Hiry\u016b no Ken\".<br><br>In Shanghai Kid, you play a Shaolin monk that travels to America to enter various fighting tournaments.<br><br>The game is a one on one versus fighter. In order to win, you must use your punch and kicks, along with joystick combinations, to attack specific points on the enemy; if you try attacking the wrong point, your attack may be blocked, or countered with an even stronger attack that can damage you heavily. The same applies to your enemy; you can counter their attacks with a strong blow, or by throwing them over your shoulder.<br><br>As you fight, a power meter will fill up. Once it flashes, you will be able to perform a flying super kick that will cause massive damage if it connects. Keep in mind that if you miss, you'll be left open to a counter attack. You can also enter a rush mode where you can unleash a flurry of less powerful attacks on your opponent for a few seconds. And finally, if you try to attack an enemy without him being in range, you'll lose a tiny sliver of health.<br><br>Your opponents include a rival Shaolin fighter, a boxer, a Muay Thai fighter, and a Karate master; until you reach your final opponent, a wrestler.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Culture Brain", "publishers": "Data East USA", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.04", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Npl_Gi-bSY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/38822"}
