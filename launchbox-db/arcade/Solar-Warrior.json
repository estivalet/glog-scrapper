{"name": "Solar-Warrior", "overview": "Xain'd Sleena was produced by Technos in 1986.<br><br>You are an armoured, rocket-booted soldier, whose mission is to defend five planets against the evil empire. You run from left to right, shooting your way to the base at the end of each level, then tackle a left to right space ship stage.<br><br>Pick up various power-up weapons and attack the end of level boss on each planet. After each space stage there is a spectacular finale. Firing constantly while moving forward is the best method. However, there is a bonus stage after you complete the five planets that is extremely difficult. It is best to avoid everything here whenever possible.<br><br>COPY OF: Solar-Warrior<br><br>Technos produced the original that spawned two other versions: Solar-Warrior by Memetron in the US, and Soldier of Light by Taito in the UK -- both 1987. Soldier of Light was the name on the UK cabinet, but the game showed Xain'd Sleena on the screen with the Taito logo instead of Technos.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Techn\u014ds Japan", "publishers": "Taito", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.29", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGL127qYF_0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/12421"}
