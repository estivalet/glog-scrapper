{"name": "Kicker", "overview": "The arcade follow-up to Yie Ar Kung Fu switches from the one-on-one style into a platform beat 'em up design.<br><br>You play Lee, who has become trapped in the Temple by the Triads, and must escape by over-powering them. Each section of the game is on several levels (which you can jump up and down) and scrolls. Balls of energy are sometimes released when you kill a Triad - grab this and it becomes a powerful weapon you can hurl at an opponent. Most enemies can be killed with standard kicks, but each level has a Super Triad who can only be killed through magic.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.07", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/9o5wGzbJzKQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/11875"}
