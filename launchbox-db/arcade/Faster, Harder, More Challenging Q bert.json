{"name": "Faster, Harder, More Challenging Q*bert", "overview": "Believing that the original game was too easy, Davis initiated development of Faster Harder More Challenging Q*bert (also known as FHMC Q*bert) in 1983, which increased the difficulty, introduced Q*bertha and added a bonus round. However, the project was canceled and the game never entered production. Despite this, Davis later released FHMC Q*bert's ROM image onto the web.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mylstar Electronics", "publishers": "Mylstar Electronics", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.6", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/o_w-TNA_TNc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/114705"}
