{"name": "Highway", "overview": "The player controls a car that must avoid the other cars, as they will try to take you out of the road. The car can jump to avoid the cars and to finish the course, as the finish is after a roadless zone. If you manage to time your jump, press button two to free the parachute and land safely. After finishing the four courses, the game starts again with increased difficulty. The game is over when the player runs out of fuel.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Taito", "publishers": "Taito", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.72", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4s1OSy89R4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/36745"}
