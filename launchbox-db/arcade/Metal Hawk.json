{"name": "Metal Hawk", "overview": "The player must take control of a helicopter (which is the eponymous \"Metal Hawk\"), and fight various enemies based on the land, in the air, and in the sea, in order to score a certain number of points for each area within a set time limit; the game employs a perspective similar to that of Namco's own Assault (which also runs upon their System 2 hardware), in which Metal Hawk stays in the center of the screen, while the play-field rotates around it. At the start of each area, Metal Hawk will fly up to its highest altitude of 400 metres - however, instead of rising up from the ground, the play-field seems to come down away from it, and when an area gets cleared, Metal Hawk will again fly up to its highest altitude and off the top of the screen. These methods of entering and leaving again reinforce the playercentric approach of the game, which also features voice samples (in Japanese).", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Namco", "publishers": "Namco", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.45", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4k3Bif0ETA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/37605"}
