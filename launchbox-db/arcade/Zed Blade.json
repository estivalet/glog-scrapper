{"name": "Zed Blade", "overview": "Zed Blade is a side-scrolling shooter with a sci-fi theme. You and/or a friend must choose one of three characters to play as, each with different speeds at which they control their ships. Then select three weapons to use for the front and back of your ship. During play, you must travel to every planet in the solar system, and defeat the various enemy ships and the boss near the end of the planet. Your weapons can be upgraded during the battle, and you can also collect HyperBombs if you want to do maximum damage. The soundtrack is reminiscent of early 1990's \"rave\" music.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "NMK", "publishers": "NMK", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.06", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHQ0_JUOnOk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40262"}
