{"name": "DrumMania 4th Mix", "overview": "Konami brings the beat back again! Here the player sits behind a virtual drumset and lets him or her loose on a variety of groovy music!<br><br>In addition to playing solo, this game can also be linked up with Keyboardmania 3rd Mix and Guitar Freaks 5th Mix to play a 'Session Mode' where up to five people (two on \"Keyboardmania\", two on \"Guitar Freaks\", and one \"Drummania\" player) can link up and play a song together.<br><br>As always with other bemani titles, select a song, and using the drumsticks and footpedal, pound out some crazy beats on the realistic drumset as the notes fall to the bottom of the screen.<br><br>Using the drumset, play along with the song as best as possible without missing too many notes. Do well enough, and you can continue. Fail, and the game is over.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami Corporation", "publishers": "Konami Corporation", "genres": "Music", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9s7taEiEww", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/36032"}
