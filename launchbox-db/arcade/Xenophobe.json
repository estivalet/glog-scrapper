{"name": "Xenophobe", "overview": "Xenos. The very name strikes fear into every colonist's heart. A distress call is received from space stations orbiting your homeworld, then silence. A single ship escapes, piloted by a battered man who tells the tale of pods that hatch into acid-spitting Xenos. A small band of engineers has been dispatched to combat the Xeno threat before it takes over all the space stations and, eventually, your homeworld.<br><br>Xenophobe is a side-scrolling shooter with platform elements. Assemble your band of engineers and fight the Xenos on each station, striving to either clear it or abandon it. You start out with a standard issue laser, but can pick up additional weapons as you find them, including Phasers, Lightning Rifles, Poofer guns, and bombs.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bally Midway", "publishers": "Bally Midway", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "3", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.24", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfFWU56hTd8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/33241"}
