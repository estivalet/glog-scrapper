{"name": "Ketsui: Kizuna Jigoku Tachi", "overview": "In the year 2054, chaos spreads over the globe as global warming finally exacts its toll on Earth: the ice caps quickly melt, causing a tremendous series of cataclysms and for entire nations to disappear under the sea. The near apocalyptic setting and the quickly depleting resources of the remaining dry lands force nations into constant war, eventually culminating into World War III; all efforts by the United Nations to cease hostilities are thwarted by a seemingly endless supply of technologically advanced weaponry being sold to each side of every conflict. After investigation, the source is tracked back to EVAC Industry co. ltd, an arms dealer who's been reaping tremendously high profits from the situation, at times directly intervening to fuel the hostilities with utter disregard towards human lives; any attempt to negotiate with the board of directors has utterly failed, the earnings having proven high enough for the company to build its own cities, shipyards, defensive emplacements and even a private airport, to the point of assembling its own army of extremely well equipped mercenary troops.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "January 28, 2003", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Cave", "publishers": "AMI", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.24", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPesUmCpBKI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/37021"}
