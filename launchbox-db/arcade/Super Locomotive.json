{"name": "Super Locomotive", "overview": "Super Locomotive was produced by Sega in 1982.<br><br>The objective of the game is to guide a train from one station to next. Along the route, the player must avoid obstacles such as other trains, planes, red signals, trucks crossing intersections, and guide the train along multiple routes by changing tracks en route. The player is armed with a steam fire bullet for destroying airborne targets, and a temporary force field which protects the train for a limited period of time. The use of the bullets and shields rapidly deplete an energy bar which must be maintained between levels by picking up oil items en route. Upon completion of a level, a bonus stage is played which involves the train attempting to shoot as many airborne enemies within a finite time period. The bonus awarded is dependent upon the number of enemies destroyed. The game then resumes on more challenging levels.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.61", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfX9tnHXX7s", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/39291"}
