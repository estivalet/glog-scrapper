{"name": "Poolshark", "overview": "Poolshark is a pool game for one or two players. The rules are different from a typical pool game played in a bar. Each player receives 30 seconds to pocket as many of the 15 balls as possible. Each sunk ball is worth one point. Pocketing all balls gains a 15 second bonus round in which additional points can be scored. Depending on the operator settings there can be multiple rounds before the winner is decided. The cue ball is directly controlled by the joystick, so there are no cue sticks involved. If the player accidentally pockets the cue ball the round ends prematurely.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "June 1, 1977", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atari", "publishers": "Atari", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lco2tW-X9Ms", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/38205"}
