{"name": "Blandia", "overview": "Blandia is a versus fighting game that takes place on the Great Continent of Eurasia and focuses on the resurrection of the demonic lord Gildus, who must be stopped by one of the six greatest warriors in the land, led by the noble Gurianos. The game's stand-out feature is the usage of weapons and armor: using traditional fighting game controls with strikes aimed high, middle, or low, characters must destroy the opponent's armor in order to win. In both one- and two-player mode, a round lasts five minutes; if it doesn't end in a knock-out, the character with higher hit points left is declared the winner. In the single-player mode opponents can be chosen by the player on the way to the final battle in the Golden Castle, rather than being selected randomly by the computer AI.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Allumer", "publishers": "Allumer", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.22", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkZABwXSEyk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/35212"}
