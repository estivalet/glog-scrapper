{"name": "Sonic the Hedgehog 2", "overview": "Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is a side-scrolling platformer based around speed, and the sequel to Sonic the Hedgehog. Like the original, players run through different worlds called \"zones\", which each have their own specific theme. There are two Acts in nearly all of the 10 Zones, and at the end of each Zone's last Act is a machine that Robotnik controls, which you must defeat to progress.<br><br>Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was one of the games adapted for release in arcades for both the Mega-Tech and Mega Play hardware.<br><br>The Mega-Tech version is essentially the same as the Mega Drive game. Cheat codes still work and the two player mode and options screen are still present. Also, like all Mega-Tech games there is a time limit on how long the game can be played and high score table on the top screen. The time limit can be increased by inserting quarters.<br><br>The Mega Play version has a number of differences from the Mega Drive game. Cheat codes cannot be used as the Options menu is missing, time counter on the HUD has been removed completely, special stages have been removed, there are no emeralds to collect and collecting points or ring will not award the player with an extra life.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.38", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/77865"}
