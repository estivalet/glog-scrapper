{"name": "Trojan", "overview": "Trojan (\u95d8\u3044\u306e\u633d\u6b4c Tatakai no Banka, lit. \"Requiem for Battle\") is a scrolling six-level post-apocalyptic beat-em-up.<br><br>The oppressed people of the world call upon you to bring peace to the unsettled land. Battle through six levels where you must use a sword and shield to attack enemies and defend yourself against the evil king's troops.<br><br>The world is ruled by a vicious warlord named Achiless and his henchmen. You are Ryu, the master of martial arts and sword-fighting, who has decided that a confrontation with Achilles is in order to bring peace and order back to the world. Your character is equipped with both a sword (for offense) and a shield (for defense). You will go through six stages starting at a ruined city, each with two boss characters (in the middle and at the end). Some enemies are so powerful that you will die the instant you fail to block. You also have to race against time as well, which makes the game that much more difficult.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Capcom", "publishers": "Capcom", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.35", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/YNeAJAILQQ0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/39821"}
