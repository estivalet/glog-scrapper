{"name": "Flying Fortress", "overview": "A black and white B-17 Bomber simulation from Electra.<br><br>Score as many points as possible in the allotted 90 seconds. Shoot or bomb enemy planes, and bomb buildings. As the game progresses, the B-17 traverses the screen from right to left, across the red zone (20 points per item shot or bombed), then the white zone (40 points), and finally the blue zone (80 points). If the plane is hit by enemy fire, runs into an enemy plane, or crashes into a building, another appears at the very right of the screen again, starting off in the low scoring section. There is no limit to the number of B-17's in a given game. If the score reaches a value (default is 1400) in the 90 seconds allocated, an additional 30 seconds is awarded.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "October 1, 1976", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Electra", "publishers": "", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/111807"}
