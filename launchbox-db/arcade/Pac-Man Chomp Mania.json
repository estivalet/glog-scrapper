{"name": "Pac-Man Chomp Mania", "overview": "Based on the classic Pac-Man of old, this new video redemption game combines that timeless retro style play with the excitement of winning tickets! Players win tickets by munching on as many dots and fruits as they can while being chased by those relentless ghosts; Inky, Blinky, Pinky, and Clyde. Grabbing the Power Pellets and eating the \u201cfrightened\u201d blue ghosts earn players extra points. If the level is cleared, players advance to bonus stage where the \u201cPAC-POT\u201d jackpot is. Chomp that and win big!<br><br>The Pac-Man Chomp Mania Cabinet is beautifully lit from top to bottom with multi-colored LEDs plus a spectacular LED marquee. That vibrantly displays the player score, in-game messages and various fun Pac-Man animations.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/118370"}
