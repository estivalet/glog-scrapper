{"name": "Clay Champ", "overview": "Clay Champ (\u30af\u30ec\u30a4\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7 Kurei Chanpu) is an electro-mechanical game released by Namco in June 1979. It is very much like the company's own Shoot Away, and was licensed to Allied Leisure Industries for US manufacturing (later renamed Centuri).<br><br>Players use the mounted lightguns (which resemble actual shotguns) to shoot the clay targets on-screen. The player only gets two shots to shoot the targets, but can earn bonus points by shooting both targets with one shot or by shooting them right as they appear on-screen. If the player shoots all targets, he or she gets an extended play time; the player can earn another one by shooting all targets during extended time. The game is over if the player fails to shoot all of the clay targets in time, or when the second exntended time ends.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.84", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/31567"}
