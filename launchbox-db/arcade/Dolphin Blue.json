{"name": "Dolphin Blue", "overview": "Dolphin Blue is a bit of an oddity. Developed and published by Sammy for their Atomiswave hardware, it's a run-n-gun arcade game released in 2003, at a time when run-n-guns were mostly out of the mainstream. It's also very obviously inspired by Metal Slug, which was, not coincidentally, the only other run-and-gun series that was still on the marketplace at this point.<br><br>You take on the role of either Ann (a royal army soldier who is out to protect the kingdom) or Erio (an arms dealer with a thirst for action). The game is set in the future and it appears a major incident has transformed what used to be a peace-filled nation into a troubled land of waste and ruin. What exactly has happened in this land remains unknown but whatever it was, it has damaged the earth's surface. Now the entire location is immersed in water. Our gallant heroes must now protect the earth's remains from the dastardly evil empire that are planning to take over the world. Dolphin Blue is an action side-scrolling shoot-em up with great graphics, super sound and gripping gameplay that will leave you sitting on the edge of your dolphin!", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "June 27, 2003", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sammy", "publishers": "Sammy", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.24", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9X3b789CLA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/41845"}
