{"name": "Pop Bingo", "overview": "And another game that combines standard puzzle mechanics with an unrelated game, this time Snow Pop is expanded upon with a Bingo element. Now some of the snowballs have letters written on them that are used to clear a bingo chart. The player who first completes a line on the chart wins. In between stages waits a bonus round, featuring nude photographs. Feels kinda awkward in combination with the overall cutesy style of the game.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dooyong", "publishers": "Dooyong", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.9", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/38206"}
