{"name": "Super Monaco GP (Mega-Tech)", "overview": "The Mega-Tech System is an arcade cabinet released by Sega in 1989, and Western counterpart to the Mega 6. It was based on the Sega Mega Drive home console, and was designed similarly to Nintendo's PlayChoice-10: players chose games from a menu of eight titles, with credits buying more play time (usually 1 minute per credit) rather than extra lives or continues; reaching a game over screen does not end the play session, and players can start over or choose a different game as long as there was some play time remaining. The Mega-Tech was not released in North America, though did see use in Asia and the PAL regions.<br><br>Formula One racing that takes place on a fair approximation of the Monaco GP course. Paddle shifters behind steering wheel are very authentic to GP technology of the time (with further bonus points for the ability to recover from spins in a realistic fashion). The best part is the force feedback in the steering wheel and seat movement mimicking acceleration, braking, cornering, spins and wrecks.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/127803"}
