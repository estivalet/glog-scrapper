{"name": "Vs. Balloon Fight", "overview": "In Vs. Balloon Fight you need to fly around with the aid of two balloons and try to pop your opponent's balloons before they pop yours. Landing on top of your opponents will cause their balloons to pop and they will use a parachute to fall to safety. You then have to destroy the fallen opponents by running into them before they can blow a new balloon and rejoin the battle. Should both of your balloons get popped, you will fall into the water below and lose a life. There is also a second game variation called \"balloon trip\" where you need to collect as many balloons as possible while avoiding the ocean floor and lightnings that form maze-like walls.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nintendo", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.05", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPrYSmD74o", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40023"}
