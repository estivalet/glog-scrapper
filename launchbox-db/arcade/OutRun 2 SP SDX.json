{"name": "OutRun 2 SP SDX", "overview": "OutRun 2 SP SDX is an updated version of OutRun 2 and OutRun 2 SP. It stands for \"OutRun 2 Special Tours Super Deluxe\" and was first shown at a privately held Sega show on July 7, 2006. This version of OutRun 2 does not run on the Sega Chihiro, but rather the Sega Lindbergh, allowing the graphics to be displayed at a resolution of 800x480 rather than the previous versions' 640x480. The game features large replica Ferrari cockpits which move and tilt with the onscreen action, and features a cooperative play mode where two players can sit next to each other in the same car and take turns driving with their own set of controls.<br><br>Two versions of the cabinet were produced. The 2-Player cabinet is designated as DX (Deluxe), and the 4-Player cabinet is designated as SDX (Super Deluxe), with raceview cameras on the players, and a live leaderboard over the center units. These large, expensive SDX units are designed for large game centers and amusement parks as a special attraction.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "2006", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Polygon Magic", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.6", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/37988"}
