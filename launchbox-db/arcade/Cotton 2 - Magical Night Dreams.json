{"name": "Cotton 2: Magical Night Dreams", "overview": "Released first as an arcade game on Sega's ST-V hardware in 1997. Only months later, it received a virtually arcade-perfect console port on the Sega Saturn. Considered the true sequel to the first game in the series, Cotton 2 also marks the introduction of two new primary characters: Appli, a young princess, and her anthropomorphic hat, Needle. Cotton 2 sees a return to traditional horizontal scrolling in the series, but it also stands out among shoot 'em ups in general for its unique gameplay system. With a heavy incorporation of Newtonian physics, Cotton 2 ultimately mixes elements of 2D platformers with traditional shoot 'em up gameplay. The first release of Cotton 2 on the Sega Saturn also included a mini-calendar for 1998.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "January 1, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Success", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.06", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzcex415c_c", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/23043"}
