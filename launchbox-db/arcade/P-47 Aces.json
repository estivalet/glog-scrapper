{"name": "P-47 Aces", "overview": "P-47 Aces is a horizonal-scrolling shooter game similar to its predecessor, P-47: The Phantom Fighter, where players assume the role of one of the four pilots from an elite squadron sent by the United World Armies taking control of their respective airplanes with their own unique abilities through eight increasingly difficult levels that take place across multiple countries around the world, each with a boss at the end that must be defeated to progress, in a effort to make a dent against the enemy.<br><br>Certain enemies carry icon-based power-up items that can be picked to increase the aircraft's firepower such as bombs and missiles. Getting hit by enemy fire or colliding against solid stage obstacles will result in losing a live, as well as a penalty of decreasing the aircraft's firepower and once all lives are lost, the game is over unless players insert more credits into the arcade machine to continue playing. A new addition to the sequel is the hyper system, which increases the plane's overall power to its maximum status after continuing. In addition to the single-player mode, the game also features a two-player cooperative multiplayer mode.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "NMK", "publishers": "Jaleco Entertainment", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.55", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2317"}
