{"name": "Chimera Beast", "overview": "Chimera Beast takes place on a planet which is described as distant and Earth-like. The planet is overrun by animals known as eaters, capable of eating other creatures and acquiring their abilities or characteristics. The player controls one of these eaters and progresses through the game by means of the Food chain, consuming microscopic organisms in the first stage, fish in the second, and so on. <br>There are two possible endings: one in which the player is able to stop the eaters from escaping the planet, and one in which the eaters do escape and, we are told, will eventually make their way to Earth.<br><br>The chief innovation of Chimera Beast is its power-up system; The eater enhances itself by eating other creatures and assuming their abilities and defenses. Consuming a crustacean might give the player's eater a hard protective shell, for example, while an insectoid creature might offer a poisonous tail instead. The game even includes the ability to use cancer as a weapon.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "", "developers": "C.P.
