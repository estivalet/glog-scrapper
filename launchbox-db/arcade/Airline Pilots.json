{"name": "Airline Pilots", "overview": "Airline Pilots is a flight simulator released for Sega NAOMI arcade hardware in 1999. The game simulates flying a Boeing 777 aircraft, and was developed with the input of engineers and pilots from Japan Airlines. Two different cabinet models were manufactured. The default type is a typical sit down cabinet with one monitor, while the \"DX type\" cabinet features three side-by-side 29\" monitors, which surround the player to create a \"cockpit\".<br><br>The extreme difficulty of \"Airline Pilots\", combined with a lack of interest in realistic flight simulators, led Sega to manufacture a conversion kit which allowed owners to convert the units into the more popular Sega Strike Fighter. As a result, Airline Pilots cabinets are relatively rare.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "March 1, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Flight Simulator", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.15", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/34916"}
