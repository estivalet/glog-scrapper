{"name": "Jumping Jack", "overview": "Jumping Jack, a scrolling computer game that was created by Stuart and Albert Ball, eventually became known as Leggit when it was released for the arcade. In 1983, Jumping Jack first became available on a home computer gaming system known as ZX Spectrum. Shortly thereafter, Imagine Software purchased developing and publishing rights to the game, and released the game under the title Leggit!<br><br>Jack, the main character, originally appeared as a crudely drawn, black stick figure. By the time that Jumping Jack made it to the arcade in 1984, all of the characters as well as the background was completely redesigned. Jack himself appears to be a small, round explorer, wearing a white hat.<br><br>Although Imagine has never official re-released the game, publishing and licensing rights have been extended to other entities. Quite a few copycats, clones and modified versions of Jumping Jack have popped up within the last few years. More recent inceptions of Jumping Jack show the main protagonist as a four-legged, green colored alien.<br><br>Jumping Jack also appears under the name Leggit! Because Sumlock, another UK based game publisher also planned to debut a game of the same name in 1983. Although the two games were completely different, Imagine Software conceded with the name change for practical purposes. Jumping Jack also came out on the Dragon 32 and Atari 800 home gaming systems. Universal is the publisher for the arcade version of Jumping Jack. Only one player mode is available.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Universal", "publishers": "Universal", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.82", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNVM2FIO9FM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/11865"}
