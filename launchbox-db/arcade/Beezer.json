{"name": "Beezer", "overview": "Turn the three-sided walls to create a six sided cell, trapping a bee inside. Do not trap yourself or you die. If the queen bee comes into the maze, she will move the walls and lay eggs. Eat the eggs to become energized before they hatch into more bees. When you are energized you can kill bees, which is just as good as trapping them. Do not touch a bee otherwise because they will kill you.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tong", "publishers": "Intrepid Marketing", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.93", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbhCKd_56dk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/35146"}
