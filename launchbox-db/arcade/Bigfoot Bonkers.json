In this game, players take the role of mice in a small playfield with a few bigfoot feet that must be avoided in addition to the walls.<br><br>The game is 2-player only, and both players are in a survival match to see who can avoid crashing longest. As players move about the playfield, they leave a trail behind. Hitting any part of the trails, or the bigfoot feet, causes a player to lose that round and gives one point to their opponent.
