{"name": "Blazer", "overview": "Blazer was produced by Namco in 1987.<br><br>The player must alternate between a tank named \"Vanguard\" and a helicopter named \"Hardy\" (and for the tenth and final mission, a hovercraft named \"Atlanta\"), to kill enemies both on land and in the air. Some air-based enemies will leave behind powerups for Vanguard to collect, when hit by its anti-aircraft missiles; they can restore its fuel, increase its fuel capacity, make it invulnerable for a short period of time, and even grant it an extra life if it manages to collect enough of them (which is initially thirteen, but it can go up to sixteen).<br><br>This game was dedicated to Shoko Tamako Sumie from all its staff; upon completion of the game, it gives a list of schematics for the player tank, and a passage from In The Cold Morning Of August.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Namco", "publishers": "Namco", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.61", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixbC-h0GCWI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/35217"}
