{"name": "Double Dragon (Neo-Geo)", "overview": "Double Dragon for the Neo-Geo is the only Double Dragon game Technos Japan made since Super Double Dragon.  This was also Technos' first game for the Neo-Geo.  Instead of a side-scrolling fighting game like the original, this one is a one-on-one fighting game that's loosely based on 1994's Double Dragon film.  However, it does borrow elements and characters from the first four Double Dragon games (I, II, III and Super).", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "March 3, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Techn\u014ds Japan", "publishers": "SNK", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.66", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmBImd6MI5k", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27051"}
