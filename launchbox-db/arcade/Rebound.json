{"name": "Rebound", "overview": "Rebound is a volleyball video game by Atari. At first, it looks similar to Pong, but the game shown is from the side, and the ball bounces up and down and across the screen, instead of simply sliding across the screen. Each player moves their paddle under the ball in order to keep it off the ground, attempting to bounce it over the net.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "February 13, 1974", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atari", "publishers": "Atari", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P59jCXTWOH8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/30425"}
