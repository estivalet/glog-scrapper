{"name": "Tecmo World Cup '90", "overview": "World Cup '90 was produced by Tecmo in 1989.<br><br>A 2-D football/soccer game with four-way scrolling movement. Choose from eight teams. The game play is fairly realistic and the moves are easy to learn.<br><br>Tecmo World Cup is a football game which features solely national teams. Like the title indicates, you can play the World Cup tournament, which will also include a qualification round. You can choose your team from a pool of 24 nations, though the assortment is not identical to the roster of the latest World Cup by the time of the games release. Also, the qualification, in contrast to the real World Cup, only has four teams as no other than the available 24 teams take part. Apart from the World Cup, the only other single-player mode is a friendly match against a randomly chosen team.<br><br>The gameplay is shown from the side and above. Before a game begins, you choose one of four different tactics (which can't be changed during half time), further team management does no exist. The game uses two buttons, one for passing and tackling, the other one for shooting or changing to another player when the opposing team has the ball.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tecmo", "publishers": "Tecmo", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57e6_Ma1XhY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/39495"}
