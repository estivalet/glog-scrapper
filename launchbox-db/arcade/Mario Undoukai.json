Like B\u016bb\u016b Mario, very little is known about it. It was made by Banpresto and licensed by Nintendo. The game is a dancing game geared toward small children. It is one of the only two dancing games in the Mario series and is very similar to the other one, Dance Dance Revolution: Mario Mix, but there are two center foot spaces and no 2-player mode.<br><br>Once a coin has been inserted, the player must choose from one of three games, all of which require the dancepad. There is also a start button to begin.<br><br>The top selection is a more athletic-based set of games that involve Olympic-style events. The right selection consists of a picture completion game and at least one other minigame that is randomly chosen. The left selection has a game of rock-paper-scissors with acchi muite hoi against Princess Peach.<br><br>After the results, a trading card is distributed from the machine, while Mario invites the player to play again.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Banpresto", "publishers": "Banpresto", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxSz0BNLqw&t=17s", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/157996"}
