{"name": "Devastators", "overview": "A middle eastern country ran by a dictator has invaded a weaker country. The invaded country's last hope for survival is enlisting the help of the Devastators, a team of freedom fighting commandos. The commando's have to go through seven missions of varying locales that include a desert, an air field, a jungle, a savanna, a navy base, mountains and finally bombed ruins performing covert operations. These operations include things such as blowing up the enemy's ammunition base, stealing a jet, and rescuing prisoners of war being held captive deep in a forest. These missions have to be completed before time runs out or the game is over. Missions can also end if the player runs out of lives, however bonus lives can be earned by getting 150 points and then at every 200 points thereafter.<br><br>The commandos are armed with an UZI sub-machine gun which has unlimited ammo plus can also pick up additional weapons from downed enemies. Additional weapons with limited uses include hand grenades, a flamethrower, a bazooka, a grenade launcher, and molotov cocktails.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "June 23, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami Industry Co.
