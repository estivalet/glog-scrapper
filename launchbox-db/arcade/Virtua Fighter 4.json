Most of them are from previous games, but two of them are brand new to this game.<br><br>VF4 has the standard array of modes, like Arcade, VS, and Practice, and it also has a new feature, called \"A.I. Sparring\", in which you train a player, controlled by the computer, by using various moves and techniques.<br><br>There are a lot of arenas to choose from. Some are interactive, in which you can break away from the main ring. When fighting on sand or snow, your fighter will leave footprints. When you're in water, you will make splashes. If you hit your opponent hard enough on a concrete floor, his body might break that part of the floor into chunks.<br><br>Each fighter has a wide array of moves, from your standard punches and kicks to ten hit combos and specials.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "2001", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Sega AM2", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9utiu3XVE8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/29092"}
