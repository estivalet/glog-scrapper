{"name": "Naname de Magic!", "overview": "Naname De Magic! was produced by Atlus in 1994.<br><br>Naname de Magic! is a 1994 Japan-exclusive puzzle arcade game. It plays similar to Hebereke no Popoon. Like Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo, the characters are super-deformed (with the first boss looking very similar to Wolfgang Krauser of the Fatal Fury series) with an exception of some of the bosses in the final stages. Another reason it links to this Capcom game, a special system is activated to defeat an opponent. One would have to stack the element icons diagonally to attack the opponent, unlike to its comparing counterpart.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atlus", "publishers": "Atlus", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.89", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kp2ViKQLRSg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/37801"}
