{"name": "Ninja Combat", "overview": "Ninja Combat was produced by Alpha Denshi in 1990.<br><br><br><br>Two ninjas, red and blue, fight wave after wave of enemies while picking up scrolls for special attacks and weapons from defeated enemies.<br><br>Two players can team up as a red and blue ninja fighting enemies. The game is long and rather hard. You fight through many stages on your way to a castle. Every stage has end boss. Along the way you pick up weapons, such as clubs and axes from fallen enemies. You also pick up ninja scrolls that replenish your health bar or give you special attacks (like a fire-dragon that flies around the screen killing all enemies).<br><br>This is a side-scrolling chop socky beat-em-up.<br><br>The game is very much like SNK-Alpha Denshi's earlier regular JAMMA release, Gang Wars. A lot of the graphics and sound effects seemed to carry directly over.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Alpha Denshi", "publishers": "SNK", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.78", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShfdduWAyJg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/37869"}
