{"name": "Blasto", "overview": "1 or 2 players each control a tank in this top-down game. The object is to clear as many mines and obstacles as you can before the timer runs out. But watch out! If you're too close to a mine when you shoot it, you'll blow up your own tank! And in a two-player game, you also have to be careful not to run into the other tank -- or get into its line of fire!", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "June 1, 1978", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gremlin", "publishers": "Gremlin", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.85", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/35216"}
