{"name": "Tylz", "overview": "This is an isometric scrolling game where the player controls a jester & has to either walk on or shoot tiles to change them from black to purple. The player can also walk over holes to change them to black tiles, which then can be changed to purple by doing either of those 2 things. Sometimes, a crown will appear. By walking over the crown, the level automatically ends and the player is transported a few levels beyond the last one. There are several enemies including various soldiers, knights, elephants, ostrich like birds, archers, and royal characters like princes, queens, and kings that the player can shoot to temporarily defeat. There is also a flat block that can only be defeated by shooting at its narrow side (not directly from the front or behind). There are also flashing tiles that the player has to get to prevent the cracking of the tiles. Once the player steps on or shoots these, he is temporarily invincible until the screen stops flashing.<br><br>Trivia:<br>This game is a very rare unreleased prototype. Only 5 PCBs were produced.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "2019", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mylstar", "publishers": "Mylstar", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/118437"}
