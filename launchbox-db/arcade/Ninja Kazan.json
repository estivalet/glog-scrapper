{"name": "Ninja Kazan", "overview": "Ninja Kazan is a platformer/hack and slash arcade game by Jaleco in 1988.<br><br>The kazan has a sword when you start, but then you can have shurikens, a chain, and three kunais as bullets (the kunais are the only weapon that you can lose when you get hit). The player can obtain magic, holding down the button can unleash magic that can be powerful than the default weapon you use. There's a total of four scrolls that you can obtain to earn more magic. On the start of the game, you have three hit points, but by getting items, you can increase your health by one hit point. Extra lives are in the game, they're normally a blue creature that runs away from you, but it occurs extremely rarely (Although you can get an extra life at 50,000 points only, or 200,000 points).", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jaleco", "publishers": "Jaleco", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.73", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltX_oFm0daA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/37873"}
