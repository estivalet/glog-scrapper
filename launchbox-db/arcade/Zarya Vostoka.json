{"name": "Zarya Vostoka", "overview": "Zarya Vostoka (Russian: \u0417\u0430\u0440\u044f \u0412\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043a\u0430, \"Dawn of the East\"), is an arcade game that was released by Nova Games in 1984; it runs on the same hardware as (and is the sequel to) Intrepid, which was released in the previous year. The player must again use a 4-way joystick to take control of a secret agent (this time, it is the eponymous \"Zarya Vostoka\"), who must enter an embassy by means of an elevator, enter several rooms, and look around them to find all necessary items, and avoid pursuing guards - unfortunately, not much else is known about the game, because it is not emulated properly with MAME (the image of the title screen shown to the right reflects this, as it displays images of the items instead of the letters that make up its name). However if you copy the four missing GFX/audio ROM files from that Intrepid romset into its folder (which come up as \"NO GOOD DUMP KNOWN\"), then start up the game, you shall be able to see its attract sequence, and partially be able to play it.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nova Games", "publishers": "Nova Games", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40260"}
