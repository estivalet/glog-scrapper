{"name": "Shogun Warriors", "overview": "Shogun Warriors plays similarly to some other 2D versus fighting games during its release, which the player's character fights against his or her opponent in best two-out-of-three matches in a single player tournament mode with the computer or against another human player. It is controlled with an 8-way joystick and 4 buttons that perform weak and strong versions of punches and kicks. In one player mode, after selecting a character, the arcade randomly selects an opponent. The opponent order goes randomly and always leaves the last four bosses in a certain order. Some characters stabbed by ones armed with katanas or other sharp weapons can cause blood to spurt out, which became popularized a few months later by Midway's Mortal Kombat. The main unique feature of Shogun Warriors is its \"grabbing system\". When the player is grabbed by the opponent, the grabber must move the joystick left and right to make it more difficult for his opponent to escape, while the one being grabbed must rapidly press any or all buttons to make it easier to escape.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "April 15, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kaneko", "publishers": "Kaneko", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.11", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLmIDZu5IvY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27160"}
