{"name": "World Stadium '90", "overview": "World Stadium '90 (\u30ef\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u30b9\u30bf\u30b8\u30a2\u30e0'90, lit. W\u0101rudo Sutajiamu '90), is a baseball arcade game that was released by Namco in 1990, only in Japan. It runs on Namco System 1 hardware, and is the third title in the company's World Stadium series; much like its immediate predecessor, it's based upon the original World Stadium game of 1988 with few minor changes (just the teams' player/manager names this time, for their logos and outfits remain unchanged from their appearances in that previous game).<br><br><br>Like the first two games, players must select one of twelve different teams in the \"Urban League\" (the Giants, Cars, Drasans, Sparrows, Wheels and Titans) and the \"Country League\" (the Lionels, Bravos, Hornets, Fires, Orients, and Buckaroos); they must then select one of 3 different stadiums (K\u014drakuen, K\u014dshien, and Mej\u0101) for the game's match to take place in, before selecting one of their chosen team's five pitchers (the rear views of whom will be displayed on the screen, as you push the joystick up and down to highlight them). Both of your chosen teams' full 9-player lineups will then be displayed on the screen, before all eighteen players run out, and take their positions on the field of the chosen stadium (for a third, and final for players who favour the K\u014drakuen and Mej\u0101 stadiums, time - and this was also the last title in the series with the Bravos and Hornets, as well as the last in the NS1 leg of the series).", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40217"}
