{"name": "S.R.D. Mission", "overview": "A space-station deep in space has been attacked and overrun by an alien force. As well as destroying the aliens, the crew on the station need rescuing. You have been tasked to fly your space-craft and fly over the station and destroy all enemies and pick up any crew standing in the open. S.R.D. Mission is a vertically scrolling shoot-em-up viewed from above where the screen scrolls constantly. The alien ships fly at you in waves and need shooting with your laser as well as their ground defences destroying with bombs. As your blasting you will see occasionally men standing in blue suits waving or running down the screen, fly over them and you pick them up but be careful not to shoot or bomb them. If you rescue a man in an orange suit your ship gets an upgrade with better lasers and bombs. Touch an alien or their bullets and you lose one of three lives, lose the lives and it's game over with no continues. Two players can play and they take it in turns to play when the other player loses a life.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Taito", "publishers": "Taito", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIqz88eRh7A", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/38667"}
