{"name": "HAL21", "overview": "HAL21 is a vertically scrolling shoot'em up released by SNK in 1985 for arcades. It is considered a spiritual predecessor to the Alpha Mission series. Gameplay is very similar to Namco's Xevious, with a button for firing regular shots and a button for bombing ground targets, controlled by a crosshair target above the player's ship. One unique feature from HAL 21 is the bosses, which are composed of multiple small parts. Whenever the player hits a boss part, it flies off from the boss's body before reattaching.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "SNK", "publishers": "SNK", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "1.71", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/36646"}
