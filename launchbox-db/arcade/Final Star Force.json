{"name": "Final Star Force", "overview": "The gameplay of Final Star Force goes back to the formula of the original Star Force, but with updated graphics and some extra power-ups. Other things that have been changed from the original are the style of the title screen's logo, the background, and some enemies. Players control the two space fighter ships Blue Nova and Red Nova. There are three different power-ups to choose from called \"Pulsators\". Each name of a Pulsator has a letter at the beginning of it (e.g. A-Pulsator, B-Pulsator, C-Pulsator). The power-up system is similar to the one seen in the 1990 Raiden arcade game. Unlike other games that requires players to obtain powerups to enhance their ships, the power meter itself charges up automatically to increase their fighters' power.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "September 1, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tecmo", "publishers": "Tecmo", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.45", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRwvBRIek5s", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/32459"}
