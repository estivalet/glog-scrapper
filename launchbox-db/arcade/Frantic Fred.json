This video redemption game is geared toward the smaller kids who we know love to operate a steering wheel, but rarely have the opportunity to play a game that utilizes the steering wheel!!<br><br>The gameplay allows the player to control a moving bear, FRED, on screen and move the bear back forth in an attempt to catch apples from from the overhead trees. The more apples that Fred catches the more tickets the player wins!!! As Fred is trying to catch the falling apples he is also attempting the avoid the falling anvils which cost him if they hit.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "The Game Room", "publishers": "The Game Room", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/36253"}
