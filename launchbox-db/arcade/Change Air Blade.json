{"name": "Change Air Blade", "overview": "Change Air Blade is a 2D vertical scrolling shooter, based on a \"boss rush\" idea. The player can select one from eight different ships (each ship has its own special form), and fights against another ships. Basically, each normal enemy is boss, with a long life bar, and has support from smaller minions. The player has the main gun and several bombs to use, and must win an air duel with the boss to progress.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Aisystem Tokyo", "publishers": "Sammy Corporation", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.62", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTdsSokkeVM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/33833"}
