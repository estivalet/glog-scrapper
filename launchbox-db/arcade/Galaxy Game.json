{"name": "Galaxy Game", "overview": "Galaxy Game is a conversion of one of the earliest video games ever produced, Spacewar. Released in September of 1971, it is the first known arcade game - beating yet another Spacewar conversion, Computer Space, by a mere two months. The game was never mass-produced and was only available at the Tresidder Union Coffee House at Stanford University.<br><br>With monochrome vector graphics, Galaxy Game is a space shooter where two players try to blow up each other's spaceship. Besides firing, players can rotate their ships left and right, thrust forward, and jump to hyperspace, reappearing at a random (potentially dangerous) location. Both ships have a limited amount of fuel that is consumed over time and as the players use their engines and the hyperspace ability. A ship explodes when it runs out of fuel.<br><br>One of the most interesting gameplay elements of the game is the gravitational pull caused by a star in the middle of the screen, which both players must avoid colliding into. However, this feature can be disabled by setting one of the machine's control switches.<br><br>The game also features a single-player mode for practice.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "September 1, 1971", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bill Pitts and Hugh Tuck", "publishers": "Computer Recreations", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.08", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVprIIDDLYY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/30361"}
