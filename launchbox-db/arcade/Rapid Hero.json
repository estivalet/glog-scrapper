{"name": "Rapid Hero", "overview": "International version of Rapid Hero was discovered called Arcadia. <br>Rapid Hero is a very classic and relatively efficient shmup . At the command of a hunter who also thinks somewhat of the design of Strike Gunner STG , you will have to repel the enemy bursts avoiding of course to make you touch ... <br><br>Two heroes are willing to carry out this mission, with a few minor differences in gameplay: the first aircraft is specialized in concentrated direct fire, the second in the deployed shot. Of course, the game offers you its selection of power-ups and special weapons, such as auxiliary and self-guided lasers. <br><br>The course of the game is rather neat with a certain sense of staging.
