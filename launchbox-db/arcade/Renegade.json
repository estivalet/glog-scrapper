{"name": "Renegade", "overview": "Renegade is a video game released in American and European arcades in 1986 by Taito. It is a westernized conversion (including changes to all of the sprites and backgrounds) of the Japanese arcade game Nekketsu K\u014dha Kunio-kun (\u71b1\u8840\u786c\u6d3e\u304f\u306b\u304a\u304f\u3093?, which roughly translates to \"Hot-Blooded Tough Guy Kunio\", released earlier the same year by Technos. It is an immediate technological predecessor to Double Dragon, and Nekketsu K\u014dha Kunio-kun is the inaugural game in the Kunio-kun series (which includes Super Dodge Ball and River City Ransom).<br><br>Renegade first introduced several trademarks of the beat 'em up genre, including 4-directional control, punch-jump-kick play action, and enemies which can sustain multiple hits. It is considered to be one of the most influential titles of the video game industry.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "January 1, 1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Techn\u014ds Japan", "publishers": "Taito", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.07", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2CJU4p4Cmc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/31965"}
