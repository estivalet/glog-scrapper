{"name": "Super Puzzle Bobble", "overview": "This latest update of Taito's classic Puzzle Bubble series adds different sized bubbles, new characters, and the ability for two players to play simultaneously on the same playfield.<br><br>The game contains amusing animations of the characters that control the cranking of the cannon. Their emotions range from shameless self-confidence after a successful chain reaction to sheer panic as a cluster of bubbles creep dangerously close.<br><br>Launch random multi-colored bubbles from your cannon up into a playfield already half-filled with gleaming colored bubbles (some containing creatures or special bonus items) which hang in clusters from the ceiling. Your goal is to connect bubbles of the same color in order to \"pop\" them over to your opponent's court as you try to contain your ever-increasing inventory of bubbles. The game is over when the bubbles finally overwhelm your playfield and touch the ground.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Taito", "publishers": "Taito", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/njC8TL60oGU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/39328"}
