{"name": "Zwackery", "overview": "A fantasy-type game with all the fairy tale elements. Jump around and preserve all the pages of Zak's \"Book of Life\" from the Gholum.<br><br>In Zwackery, you control a wizard named Zachary Thwacker. Your beloved has been transformed into a frog and you have to make your way to the culprit . You wield a sword and carry a shield. The magic spells are picked up along the way, as well as keys and bonuses. Zachary's cloak changes color as you progress through the game and you also earn new titles (Amateur, Novice, Adept, Conjurer,...). After the Boss has been killed, you play the same levels again, with more enemies and increased difficulty. The controls are quite complex, identical to Discs of Tron and they implement a remarkable feature : You can control the aim of both the sword and shield (spin them).<br><br>The game was quite a flop due to its quirky controls, which are identical to Discs Of Tron. Do not be surprised if it takes some time to learn how to operate this platform game using these controls.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bally Midway", "publishers": "Bally Midway", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.21", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zGNCPUww-g", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/32759"}
