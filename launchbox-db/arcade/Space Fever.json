{"name": "Space Fever", "overview": "Space Fever is Nintendo's own (unauthorised, hence no copyright notices on-screen) clone of Taito's Space Invaders. In order not to come off as a blatant pirate copy, it introduces a range of Nintendo-specific touches:<br><br>Taito's aquatic-themed aliens are replaced by chickens, cats and dogs (or pigs?)<br>The \"heartbeat\" backdrop sound is replaced by a more intricate beat.<br>The bonus UFO scores lower and flashes in seven colours.<br>There are 12 instead of 11 columns of aliens.<br>Three modes of play are available:<br>A: The aliens move not in one, but in two blocks which split up and join together again.<br>B: The game start with just one row of aliens, but as they move downwards, new rows are added from behind.<br>C: Basically the same gameplay as Taito's original.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "June 1, 1979", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nintendo R&D1", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.13", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEQpCtUHX6Y", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/39001"}
