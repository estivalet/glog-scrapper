{"name": "Airwolf", "overview": "A helicopter battle game based upon the TV show of the same name.<br><br>Airwolf, an advanced supersonic helicopter with stealth capabilities and a formidable arsenal, was designed by Dr. Charles Henry Moffet (David Hemmings) - a genius with a psychopathic taste for torturing and killing women - and built by the Firm, a division of the CIA (a play on the term \"the Company\", a nickname for the CIA). As the series begins, Dr. Moffet and his crew steal Airwolf during a live-fire weapons test. During the theft, Moffet opens fire on the Firm's bunker, killing a United States Senator and seriously injuring Firm deputy director Michael Coldsmith-Briggs III (codename \"Archangel\"). Moffet takes the gunship to Libya, where he begins performing acts of aggression - such as sinking an American destroyer - as a service for military strongman Muammar Gaddafi, who allows Moffet to keep Airwolf on Libyan soil.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "September 1, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kyugo Boueki", "publishers": "Kyugo of America, Inc", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.69", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D--ajlwPCac", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21974"}
