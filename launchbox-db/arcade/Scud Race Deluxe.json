{"name": "Scud Race Deluxe", "overview": "Scud Race, known as Sega Super GT in North America, and Scud Race in Europe/Japan, is a 1996 racing game developed by Sega AM2 for Sega Model 3. \"Scud\" stands for \"Sport Car Ultimate Drive\".  <br><br>Scud Race came in either Twin or Deluxe cabinets, which can be linked together for up to eight players for the twin or 4 players for the deluxe cabinet (2 simultaneous). The Deluxe cabinet features a larger 50-inch projector screen, enhanced control placement and the \"Direct Rolling Motorized System\" allowing the player seat to roll left or right during gameplay. Other than the cabinet design, the gameplay for the Deluxe and Twin models is essentially the same.  <br><br>Scud Race follows the same basic gameplay rules as Daytona USA, as both games share the same game engine. It it is a racing game in which the player competes against several dozen computer controlled cars in an attempt to finish first. As an \"arcade style\" racer, much of the \"realism\" is taken out of the equation in order to provide the user with a fast paced, entertaining experience - cars do not handle like they would in reality, but rather how users would want these cars to handle.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega AM2", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.36", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/38737"}
