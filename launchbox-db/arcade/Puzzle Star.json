{"name": "Puzzle Star", "overview": "In each puzzle, the player has several icons stacked and limited time to complete the puzzle by earning a set number of combos. The player gets a combo by putting three of the same icons together in a row. In each row of the stack the player can only extract an icon from the leftmost column. Getting inconsistent icons in all three slots places them at the bottom of the stack. Placing a star in the appropriate slot, while getting a combo earns the player an extra time boost. Using an extra boost adds five seconds to the time remaining. The player can put back an icon if a mistake is made, but this ability is limited. Fulfilling the combo goal grants the player promotion, which makes it possible to skip puzzle levels. When all levels are finished, the player proceeds to the next stage, each harder than the first.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "September 20, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "IGS", "publishers": "IGS", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/38342"}
