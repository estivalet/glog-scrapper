{"name": "Ultraman Club: Tatakae! Ultraman Kyoudai!!", "overview": "Ultraman Club: Tatakae! Ultraman Kyoudai!! is a 2D top-down single screen arcade game, based on the superhero Ultraman, with chibi, anime-style graphic. The player controls one of 8 versions of Ultraman. Gameplay is very simple - Ultraman must kill all enemies on screen. He has two types of attack - one is very short, but has basically unlimited ammo, & the second has better range, but is very limited. Fallen enemies drop various bonuses (like extra life or bombardment special moves), & Ultraman can pick them up.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Banpresto", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.73", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/39888"}
