{"name": "Xexex", "overview": "Xexex is a 2D side scrolling shoot'em up, similar to Gradius or R-type. The game also uses the \"tentacle mechanics\" from X Multiply. The player pilots a ship called the Flintlock and must save a blue haired princess named Irene. He flies to the right shooting at enemies in his way. The ship can grab an enemy and use it as a weapon. There is also a detachable orb called Flint available, which behaves similar to R-Type's \"Force Device\" or Gradius' \"Option\".<br><br>This game is known in Europe and Japan as Xexex and Orius in North America.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "January 1, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.82", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dACHOjChjT0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/24332"}
