{"name": "Ah Eikou No Koshien", "overview": "Ah Eikou No Koshien is a baseball game with a cartoon aesthetic for one or two players. The game follows all regular baseball rules with the exception of a stamina mechanic that allows players to charge up before batting or pitching to get the chance for a powerful action and a humorous animation. When the bar is drained entirely this has an influence on the player both visually and in their capabilities. The pitcher will for instance no longer be able to throw fast.<br><br>While pitching or batting the controls are limited to a small amount of movement and starting the action, with or without charge. Once the ball is in the field the actions are largely controlled by the computer automatically, even though the player is still able to steer a running player and can choose where to throw a caught ball. The catches are however done automatically.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "April 1, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Taito", "publishers": "Taito", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.92", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaJYX0ynT9w", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27043"}
