{"name": "Terminator Salvation Arcade", "overview": "In 2018 the war rages on between human resistance and the machines of Skynet. The player plays the role of John Connor through various missions that will lead to Skynet itself. The first mission is to find the underground laboratory where Skynet conducts experiments on humans while in the second, he must escort the refugees to a safehouse and then destroy Skynet.<br><br>The Deluxe cabinet is impressive: it measures 2.67 meters high, is surmounted by a T-600 bust and features a 42'' LCD screen. It is also equipped with red neon and LED lights that flash during attract and when the player is hit and has a powerful 2.1 sound system. The guns are quite heavy and have a recoil effect despite a toy-like visual aspect (grey colour, orange ends). Too bad that some parts of the cabinet are made of cheap plastic. Two other cabinets also exist for this game: a standard 32'' version with mounted guns (like Midway's Terminator 2) and a super deluxe 100'' machine equipped with a projector and external speakers.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Play Mechanix", "publishers": "PlayMechanix", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YUqdDZeXl8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/155262"}
