{"name": "Radar Scope", "overview": "In Radar Scope, Earth is being attacked by Gamma Raiders, and it's your job as Captain to destroy their ships. Your scope appears at the bottom of the screen and can move from left to right. The Gamma Raider fleet is at the top of the screen, hovering back and forth. At this distance, your shots can only destroy the closest ships when they hover forward. Soon, the ships will swoop down and attack your scope, and this is your chance to destroy them. A damage meter is provided at the bottom of the screen.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "October 8, 1980", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nintendo R&D1", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.04", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtube.com/watch?v=5kbliYx51ok", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/12237"}
