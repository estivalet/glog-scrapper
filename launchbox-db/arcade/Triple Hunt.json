{"name": "Triple Hunt", "overview": "Three shooting games in one unit; Hit the Bear, Witch Hunt and Racoon Hunt. The operator can select any one of the three games for his location and change it periodically merely by putting new graphic panels in and adjusting a switch on the P.C. board. <br><br>Hit The Bear is a modern video version of the classic bear shooting game. Realistically animated bears walk through a 3-D green forest. When hit, the bear roars, stands up and turns to walk in the opposite direction. <br><br>The Witch Hunt game changes the setting to a mysterious haunted house where players shoot at ghosts appearing in the windows and witches and bats flying across the screen. <br><br>In Racoon Hunt, players shoot at racoons climbing trees in an Autumn forest. The objective is to keep the racoons from reaching the top of the trees as they climb faster and faster as the score goes up.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "April 1, 1977", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atari", "publishers": "", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/39798"}
