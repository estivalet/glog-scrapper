Once a player has completed the first round, they have the option to risk half of their tickets, and show their sharpened skills, by entering the Super Bonus Round to win the ticket jackpot.<br><br>The Super Bonus can be rewarding, with hundreds upon hundreds of tickets to be won! In the finale, players will need to have their bow split an apple, with wind and distance causing issues, in order to win!<br><br>The cabinet is made using a durable laminated plywood cabinet, and features a crystal clear 32\u201d horizontally mounted LCD screen.<br><br>The animated medieval theme makes this game fun and exciting for players of all ages.
