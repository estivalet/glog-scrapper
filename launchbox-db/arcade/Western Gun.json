{"name": "Western Gun", "overview": "Western Gun, which served as an inspiration for Gun Fight in the USA (they're similar in gameplay and theme, but they're two different games), is a 1975 arcade shooter game designed by Tomohiro Nishikado, and released by Taito in Japan and Europe and by Midway Games in North America. It was the first video game to depict human-to-human combat, while the Midway version was also the first video game to use a microprocessor. Following its November 1975 release in North America, it went on to sell over 8,000 arcade cabinets in the United States. It was ported to the Bally Astrocade video game console as a built-in game in 1977 as well as several home computer platforms. <br> <br>The theme of the game involves two Old West cowboys armed with revolvers and squaring off in a duel. Whoever shoots the other cowboy first wins the duel. Unlike in a real-life duel, however, both cowboys get numerous opportunities to duel in order to score points (one point per successful draw).", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "September 1, 1975", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Taito", "publishers": "", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.nicozon.net/watch/sm7817061", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/107996"}
