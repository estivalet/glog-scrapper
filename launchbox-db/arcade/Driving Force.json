{"name": "Driving Force", "overview": "You are challenged by four different driving conditions that alternate along the route; normal daytime, snow(?), fog (very difficult), and nighttime. The game is timed. You can earn extended time by reaching the checkpoints. Your score is apparently considered your mileage. You earn bonus points for passing cars. These points are added to your score at the end of the game. A score of 10000 is required to get your initials in the high score table.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Shinkai, Inc.", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.21", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IsDaMF_8oM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/36026"}
