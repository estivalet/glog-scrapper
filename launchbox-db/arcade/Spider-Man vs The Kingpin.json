{"name": "Spider-Man vs The Kingpin", "overview": "The Mega-Tech System is an arcade cabinet released by Sega in 1989, and Western counterpart to the Mega 6. It was based on the Sega Mega Drive home console, and was designed similarly to Nintendo's PlayChoice-10: players chose games from a menu of eight titles, with credits buying more play time (usually 1 minute per credit) rather than extra lives or continues; reaching a game over screen does not end the play session, and players can start over or choose a different game as long as there was some play time remaining. The Mega-Tech was not released in North America, though did see use in Asia and the PAL regions.<br><br>Spider-Man vs. The Kingpin, commonly referred to as just Spider-Man, is a action platform video game based on the Spider-Man Marvel comic book series. It was originally released in 1991 for the Sega Mega Drive (alongside a differing Master System version).", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Technopop", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/njmzk4yfYXs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138472"}
