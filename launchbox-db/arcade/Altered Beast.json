Savagely intent upon rescuing Athena, daughter of Zeus, from the demon god Neff, you stalk the bowels of Hades and beyond.<br><br>What you are now you will not be. You are the Altered Beast - bestowed with five formidable forces of transformation - each more ferocious, more overwhelming, than the last. By battling, conquering and capturing spirit balls, your metamorphic powers will grow. But to what end?<br><br>The final confrontation. Your triumph over crocodile worms, hammer demons and grave masters brings on the horror of Neff himself. But boldness and cunning will be rewarded - in the ultimate Altered Beast!<br><br>Transformation is the ultimate power.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "August 1, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Team Shinobi", "publishers": "Activision", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.76", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqHpyHR1P0I", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/5267"}
