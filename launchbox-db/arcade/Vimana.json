{"name": "Vimana", "overview": "Vimana is a vertical scrolling space themed shoot 'em up game where you take control of a spaceship. A once prosperous planet in an unnamed solar system was destroyed in a terrible war. The few survivors have decided to fight on and avenge their planets destruction putting their fate in your fighter Vimana (that is apparently also a saint). The name Vimana refers to a flying chariot or temple in the Hindu religion.<br><br>You fight a variety of space crafts, static guns and bosses. While playing destroyed enemies drop power-ups. These include: a weapons power-up (max five times), plus one (limited) circle bomb, plus one up and a bonus points power up. Holding the fire button down for a while and then releasing it will create a spread shot. You can play solo or with a friend.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.68", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/39972"}
