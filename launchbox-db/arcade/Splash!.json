{"name": "Splash!", "overview": "Splash was developed by OMK Software and published by Gaelco in 1992.<br><br>Splash! is a game where the player controls a paint brush in a single-screen environment and needs to uncover a revealing picture of a woman by removing the blue colour that covers the entire screen and image. The brush can be freely moved anywhere on the screen in eight directions and based on its position the colour is also removed without an additional action. Meanwhile the player has to navigate obstacles and avoid bubbles that bounce around the screen. Three lives are provided at the start and a collision with a bubble is immediately fatal, removing a life. There is a time limit and the game shows a completion percentage near the top of the screen. Not every level demands a 100% percentage to complete it.<br><br>Bubbles can be taken out with shots, but only 50 are provided at the start of the game and they cannot be replenished. The player also needs to make good use of the momentum provided by disappearing bubbles as they respawn eventually. Destroyed bubbles leave behind red stars that turn into coins with bonus points when they are touched. Sometimes bombs can be found as well. These can be dropped anywhere on the screen where they remain indefinitely. They explode when a bubble touches them. The game contains 66 stages.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "OMK Software", "publishers": "Gaelco", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.96", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LxjjKkczAk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/39082"}
