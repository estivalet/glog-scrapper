It was published by Sega and developed by Amusement Vision. It has only the Main Game with exactly the same levels as Super Monkey Ball, except it only has one Master Stage (Master 9, A.K.A. Bridge Master In Super Monkey Ball Deluxe). Super Monkey Ball is in fact, a port with added Party Games and Mini Games. GonGon was not an available character until Super Monkey Ball. <br><br>Monkey Ball served as the base for its successor Super Monkey Ball and all later games in the series. It was released as a NAOMI arcade cabinet in Japan a year prior to the release of Super Monkey Ball. <br><br>AiAi, MeeMee, and Baby are playable. The difficulty levels available in the beginning are Beginner, Advanced and Expert, with Master being unlockable. The object of the game is to reach the goal without falling off the floor or running out of time. The playable floors were recycled into floors for later games, such as Super Monkey Ball, Super Monkey Ball 2, and Super Monkey Ball Deluxe.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "June 23, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Amusement Vision", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/134241"}
