{"name": "Car Polo", "overview": "Car Polo is a mix of top down driving and a football game for up to four players.<br><br>The players are divided in two teams and must push and bump the ball into the goal to score the most points during a single 99 second round. When three or fewer people are playing the remaining cars are controlled by the CPU.<br><br>The red and magenta colored cars have to get the ball into the red goal in the right-hand side, while the blue and cyan colored cars try to bump the ball into the blue goal on the left. When either team scores a robot appears which moves the ball back to the middle of the field and the game continues. When the timer runs out the game is over.<br><br>The arcade cabinet features a full color monitor, which was a novelty at the time, and four driving wheels. There are two driving wheels on each side for controlling each of the cars. Next to the wheel is a shifter, to shift the car in forward or reverse mode, and a foot peddle at the bottom to thrust the car either forward or backwards.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "March 1, 1977", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Exidy", "publishers": "Exidy", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.14", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMljzipOy4s", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/24895"}
