{"name": "Goindol", "overview": "Use your paddle to keep the ball bouncing and destroy all the blocks. Allowing the ball to get past your paddle costs you a life. Destroy all blocks to advance to the next level. Hit bonus item for extra point and bonus screens.<br><br>This is a classic destroy-the-blocks game like Arkanoid, but it has some additional features such as two angled \"rubber bands\" near the bottom the screen that bounce the ball sort of like the bottom kick bumpers do on a pinball machine. Also, there are three blocks in the middle that you can not destroy, but each time you hit them they rotate through the numbers 1-9. If you get all three to have the same number, you get to go to a bonus screen. There are at least 100 unique levels in the game.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "SunA", "publishers": "SunA", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.8", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jUC5M4Z5Lg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/36452"}
