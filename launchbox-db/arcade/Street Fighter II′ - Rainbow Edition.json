{"name": "Street Fighter II\u2032: Rainbow Edition", "overview": "Street Fighter II\u2032: Rainbow Edition is a pirated hack of Street Fighter II\u2032: Champion Edition made by Hung Hsi in 1992, notable for modifying many gameplay aspects -- the most noticeable being the ability to transform into other characters and being able to pull off special moves in midair.<br><br>Some of the special moves were modified, such as the Hadokens, which can either home in on the opponent or travel extremely fast, as well as 7 different characters being able to execute them as opposed to just Ryu and Ken. Zangief moves noticeably faster in this game, and E. Honda can pull off Hadokens when performing his Hyakuretsu Harite.<br><br>The graphics and music are identical to those in the original game aside from the title's logo, which is now rainbow-coloured, which is where this hack gets its name from.<br><br>Although there are many different revisions of this hack readily dumped and emulated, several versions are still left undumped. The rampant craziness with these hacks and the popularity of arcade distributors putting these hacks in machines was one of the reasons behind the creation of the legitimate Street Fighter II\u2032 Turbo: Hyper Fighting update.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hung Hsi", "publishers": "Hung Hsi", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90576"}
