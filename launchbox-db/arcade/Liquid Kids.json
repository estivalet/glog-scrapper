{"name": "Liquid Kids", "overview": "Hipopo waddles through many cute levels in search of his girlfriend. He rescues other captured hippo-like animals on the way. He throws globes full of water that gushes when it hits a wall or creature. The water attack is exactly like Taito's Bubble Bobble water attack. The game is a 4-way scroller with very large levels and lots of surprises. Many of the levels have moving platforms, collapsing floors and other obstacles.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "July 1, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Taito", "publishers": "Taito", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.88", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKU1FuVCgiM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/29608"}
