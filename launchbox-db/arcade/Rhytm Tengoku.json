{"name": "Rhytm Tengoku", "overview": "Players start the game with two hearts. Each heart is lost when starting a Rhythm Game. Getting a Superb or Perfect gives an extra heart, as well as close the game for the rest of the Stage. If the player runs out of hearts, they will need to spend a credit to continue (or, depending on the machine's settings, multiple credits, or none if set to Freemode). The player needs to clear all five games and the Remix in the Stage with at least an OK to move on. Depending on the settings, the Remix may be unselectable, requiring the player to clear all the games in order to play it.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "July 1, 2007", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "JP Room", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Music", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78300"}
