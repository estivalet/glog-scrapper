{"name": "Gratia: Second Earth", "overview": "Gratia offers a particular perspective where the ground fills the entire screen. This graphic bias is important, since your ship has, in addition to the primary fire, an air-ground laser. This air-to-air / air-to-ground armament, all in all very classic, is here highlighted: there are permanently on all the screen two types of enemies for which it is necessary to use two different types of weapons.<br><br>The game is rather enjoyable to play without reaching peaks, and will probably appeal to lovers of Darius which it is quite clearly inspired. His great strength however is his graphics: once past the surprise of this visualization \"scroll-side with ground above\", we find ourselves in front of a game with colorful decorations, fine and varied sprites, and some well felt zoom effects. No complaints on this point, it's all good.<br><br>A good game, certainly not very relaxing, but enjoyable, at least to admire all the scenery.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jaleco", "publishers": "Jaleco", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.43", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOk8zgMxhwM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/36552"}
