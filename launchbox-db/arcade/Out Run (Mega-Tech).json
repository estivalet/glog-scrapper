{"name": "Out Run (Mega-Tech)", "overview": "The Mega-Tech System is an arcade cabinet released by Sega in 1989, and Western counterpart to the Mega 6. It was based on the Sega Mega Drive home console, and was designed similarly to Nintendo's PlayChoice-10: players chose games from a menu of eight titles, with credits buying more play time (usually 1 minute per credit) rather than extra lives or continues; reaching a game over screen does not end the play session, and players can start over or choose a different game as long as there was some play time remaining. The Mega-Tech was not released in North America, though did see use in Asia and the PAL regions.<br><br>You drive a Ferrari Testarossa through various stages each with a checkpoint at the end of the stage that must be reached within the time limit. The player can choose which route to take through the game. The driver also has a choice of three different themes to listen to while driving.<br><br>Out Run was a critical and commercial success. It is notable for its innovative hardware (including a moving cabinet), pioneering graphics and music, a choice in both soundtrack and route, and its strong theme of luxury and relaxation.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega AM2", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/127798"}
