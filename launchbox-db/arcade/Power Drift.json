{"name": "Power Drift", "overview": "Choose from wacky drivers, like Jason the Skinhead or Jeronimo the Mohican and rev your way through all the stomach-churning circuits! Watch the dust fly and the wheels spin as you screech over a roller coaster track and wave goodbye to your opponents. Roar over mounds of mud, drive through the desert, slip 'n' slide on snow-covered tarmac and race your way through the night to face the final lap! CAREFUL! Power Drift is no easy ride! If you're heading for a collision hold on to your seat and enjoy those 360 degree spins before you bump back down to earth!", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "April 25, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.7", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vSZip5RC5c", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/31559"}
