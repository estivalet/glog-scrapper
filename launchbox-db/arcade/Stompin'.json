{"name": "Stompin'", "overview": "Stompin' is an arcade game where the player has to prevent various bugs and critters from eating up all the food located in the centre of the screen. The game is played with a floorplay controller similar to a dance mat which means that the player literally has to stomp on the creatures as they appear. There are eight sections surrounding the food and the player simply steps on the corresponding area on the floor to kill the bug. Additionally there is a limited amount of zappers available which when used kill all critters on the screen. There are three different environments, each with three or four levels. Critters that will appear include ants, cockroaches, gophers, frogs and fishes. The game ends when all the food has been taken away.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bally Sente", "publishers": "Bally Sente", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/39168"}
