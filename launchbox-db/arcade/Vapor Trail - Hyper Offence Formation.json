{"name": "Vapor Trail: Hyper Offence Formation", "overview": "Choose one of three different planes to save New York in this vertical shooter with weapon power-ups.<br><br>A great shooter in all respects because of the driving rock soundtrack, multiple scroll speeds and good use of parallax scrolling. There is also a genuine feeling of being challenged but never overwhelmed.<br><br>The game scrolls at various speeds forwards and even backwards while fighting the end-of-level bosses. Shooting certain enemies releases power-ups and bonuses. There are different main weapon systems such as rapid-firing guns, lasers, bombs etc. that give the game a limited strategy. Certain levels and sections are easier complete with particular weapons.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Data East", "publishers": "Data East", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.68", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/llHEBE4jA9E", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/39942"}
