{"name": "Sega Touring Car Championship", "overview": "Sega Touring Car Championship is a Sega Model 2C CRX arcade racing game developed by Sega AM5 in 1996. It is similar to Sega Rally Championship in design, but uses touring cars instead of rally cars. Unlike Sega Rally Championship, Sega Touring Car Championship has never seen a sequel, and it considered a far less successful game for a variety of reasons, most notably the steep difficulty curve and often awkward car handing.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "January 1, 1996", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31fy_CU9xFw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/14487"}
