{"name": "Point Blank 3", "overview": "Gunbalina (\u30ac\u30f3\u30d0\u30ea\u30fc\u30ca, lit.

The Sony PlayStation version features five different modes, Arcade, Endurance, Versus, Party and Training - and, much like in the PS versions of its two predecessors, it was compatible with Namco's own Sony PlayStation equivalent of Nintendo's Famicom Light Gun (or \"NES Zapper\"), the \"Guncon\".", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Namco", "publishers": "", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/38172"}
