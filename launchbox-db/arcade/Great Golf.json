{"name": "Great Golf", "overview": "The Mega-Tech System is an arcade cabinet released by Sega in 1989, and Western counterpart to the Mega 6. It was based on the Sega Mega Drive home console, and was designed similarly to Nintendo's PlayChoice-10: players chose games from a menu of eight titles, with credits buying more play time (usually 1 minute per credit) rather than extra lives or continues; reaching a game over screen does not end the play session, and players can start over or choose a different game as long as there was some play time remaining. The Mega-Tech was not released in North America, though did see use in Asia and the PAL regions<br><br>Great Golf, known as Masters Golf in Japan, is a sports game developed and published by Sega for the Sega Master System and Mega-Tech arcade system. The game makes use of the FM Sound Unit for enhanced music on the Japanese Sega Mark III (the Japanese Master System has the FM unit built in).<br><br>Another golf game, also named Great Golf, was released in Japan a year earlier for the Master System. This game differed from the international Great Golf in that it had no FM sound and is played from an isometric viewpoint. When the second game was released in Japan, it was renamed Masters Golf to avoid confusion.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega R&D 2", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/enmNlJ4JzuU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138471"}
