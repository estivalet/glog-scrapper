{"name": "Konami GT", "overview": "The player drives a sports car which must reach various checkpoints without running out of fuel. A turbo mode (activated by the gear shift) increases the car's speed but uses more fuel and puts the player at a higher risk of hitting an obstacle. Fuel power-ups can be found on the road which the player must pick up to make it to the final checkpoint.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "July 1, 1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.93", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/mR7Rm7PXysw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/29604"}
