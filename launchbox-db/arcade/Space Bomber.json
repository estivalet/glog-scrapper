{"name": "Space Bomber", "overview": "Space Bomber (\u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u30dc\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc) is a shoot 'em up arcade game released in 1998 by Japanese company Psikyo.<br><br>The parodic versions of Space Invaders are almost a genre in their own right, a genre of which Space Bomber is a beautiful incarnation. After a kitschissime intro that puts immediately in the bath (the wicked aliens arrive, oh! Pabo!), One attacks a part of a game completely to the west.<br><br>On the bases of a Space Invaders (no scrolling, enemies coming from above) the game adds a greater freedom of movement, a system of power ups but above all a system of capture of enemies: the ship has A grapple allowing him to kidnap and store up to 3 opponents. You can then use it as a weapon: each type of enemy captured having a different effect, the possibilities are very numerous, with quite a few weak gags to the key.<br><br>The game especially plays the map of the comic, with rather stunning enemies (giant pig and flying trash are only glimpses ...), and on an excellent and very funny gameplay, especially (as usual in this genre Of games) to two players. The graphics are quite special, in a 3D not always very successful but rather original.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Psikyo", "publishers": "Psikyo", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.61", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/h3bQWFnj5VQ?t=135", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/12436"}
