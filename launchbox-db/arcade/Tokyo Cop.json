The game consists of more than 48 missions covering four of Tokyo's districts: Ginza, Hibiya, Shinjuku and Shibuya. To gain promotion the player has to catch a number of criminals within a time limit. Not succeeding with this can instead lead to the player being demoted. To arrest a criminal the player has to move his car along side the criminal and hit it. Most of the time one hit is enough but for some of the tougher opponents multiple hits will be needed.<br><br>There are in total nine cars to drive and each has their own characteristics that makes them more or less suitable for pursuing the various criminals. The player has to watch out for opposing traffic since collisions will lead to the car being damaged and after a while it might become unusable. Then it has to be left at the garage for repair and will not be available in the next mission. <br><br>The game has a link mode for two cabinets where the players compete over four missions. There is also an online leaderboard if the machine is connected to the Internet. Games can be saved on the machine and are loaded by entering a pin code on the cabinet's keyboard. If the machine is connected to the Internet, saved games can be accessed from any other machine that is also connected. If there is no connection the load function still works on the local machine.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "2003", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.12", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/39699"}
