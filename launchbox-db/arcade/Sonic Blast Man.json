The player gets three chances per scenario to throw a punch in order to clear their objective. Each scenario ends after three punches whether the goal was accomplished or not, with the appropriate ending appearing depending on whether the player was successful or not. The game then records the players max power score (the strongest punch during the three rounds) and the total punch power (the score of the three rounds combined).<br><br>The game contains both an easy and a hard difficulty setting,<br><br>The SNES version contains the arcade scenarios as bonus stages, however the gameplay mechanics have been altered to fit in with that consoles control scheme.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/114469"}
