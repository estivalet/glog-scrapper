{"name": "Xybots", "overview": "Xybots was produced by Atari Games in 1987.<br><br><br>Run your human through mazes with a 3-D over-the-shoulder view. Shoot tons of nasty robots that are out to get you. Exit each level to progress to a new maze, with boss levels and the option to buy upgrades between levels.<br><br>This is possibly one of the first 3-D shooters ever made. While there are none of the full, free motion effects of the traditional modern day 3-D engines, you are able to change perspectives on the fly.<br>The names of the characters are Captian Ace Gunn and Major Rock Hardy.<br><br>This game is like playing a primitive version of Doom, or a futuristic, first-person 3-D Gauntlet game.<br><br>The game also got ported to many computers back in the day including the MSX, ZX Spectrum, C64, Amiga, and Atari ST just to name a few. Also got a port to Atari's own Lynx handheld in 1991.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atari", "publishers": "Atari", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrvfBUjvj2k", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/12423"}
