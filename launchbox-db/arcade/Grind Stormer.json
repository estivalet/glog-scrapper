{"name": "Grind Stormer", "overview": "Grind Stormer and V Five. Both offers the same levels and enemies, but have a different approach to how the player can use power-ups.<br><br>In this hectic, top-down, vertically-scrolling shooter where the screen is constantly filled with enemies and bullets, players have a constant, unlimited firing rate, enhanced by power-ups that include missiles, target-seeking bullets, shields, additional speed, extra power and bonus points. In Grind Stormer the ship always moves at a fast speed and the player can collect bombs that damage the entire screen and fend off bullets. The other variant V Five takes a Gradius-approach to power-ups, having the player advance through a selection of power-ups shown on the right by collecting tokens. In the first mode power-ups are immediately applied. In the second mode the ship is much slower and the player needs to decide to spend tokens on speed power-ups right away or save them to advance to seeking bullets or additional power.<br><br>The game difficulty, amount of lives and continues can be set in the options. After using a continue, the player immediately receives a \"Special\" power-up granting four wingmen.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "ToaPlan", "publishers": "Toaplan", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.78", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xq2iQIFLfs0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/29526"}
