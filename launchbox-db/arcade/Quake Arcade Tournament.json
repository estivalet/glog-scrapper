{"name": "Quake Arcade Tournament", "overview": "The classic PC shooting game has been adapted for tournament play in the arcade. This prototype features modified deathmatch levels and a special custom weapon. Machines may be linked to provide competitive play.<br><br>The game is a direct conversion from the PC game, but with a few changes. The monsters may drop an occasional prize pack when killed. The machine contains a prize printer that would print out a special ticket reward, presumably much like a redemption machine.<br><br>The game is powered by a complete Pentium PC inside the game. A keyboard and mouse can be found immediately below the control panel (not accessible by the player, however). Supposedly only twenty of these prototypes were manufactured. When the game was first introduced, Lazer-Tron was bought out and due to problems with the contracted programmer, the game was never further developed.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1998", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOpqVM2aDkg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/38361"}
