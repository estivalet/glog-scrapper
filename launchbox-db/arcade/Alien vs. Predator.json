Before they can be killed, a pair of the Predators appear and destroy the Aliens. The Predators offer an alliance with the two humans in order to stop the Alien infestation.<br><br>The players take control of up to three of four characters: Dutch, Linn, a Predator hunter, and a Predator warrior, and battle the Aliens through several environments. In the process, the characters discover that the Alien presence on Earth is the result of an experiment headed by a renegade General Bush of the U.S. Colonial Marines in conjunction with the Weyland-Yutani corporation. They destroy the Alien hive by crashing a military ship into San Drad, causing a huge explosion. The Predator warrior then gives his wrist blades to Dutch and Linn in recognition of their skills as warriors, before the Predators depart back into space.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "May 20, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Capcom", "publishers": "Capcom", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.38", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOrKil9Lw_A", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/10282"}
