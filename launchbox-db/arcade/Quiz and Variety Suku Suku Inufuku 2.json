{"name": "Quiz and Variety Suku Suku Inufuku 2", "overview": "As the sequel to SukuSuku Inufuku (\"quickly, lucky dog\"), Motto SukuSuku (\"more quickly\") again features the rather odd-looking dog Inufuku, who also has cameos in some of the later Sonic Wings games. The game spans a year; in January, the player adopts an Inufuku to raise. Throughout the year, the player encounters a variety of characters who challenge her/him to quizzes and competitive games. The player's performance on the challenges influences how her/his Inufuku looks as it grows up. The characters, locations, and title cards for each month that show up in the game also vary. Lord River-n-White also appears as Taro Kitashirakawa, the name he is given in Rabio Lepus, and Mao Mao also has a cameo.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "2004", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Quiz", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/38384"}
