{"name": "Cosmic Guerilla", "overview": "Cosmic Guerilla is a fixed screen arcade shooter. Like in Space Invaders, the player controls his laser gun left and right along the bottom of the screen and shoot at the aliens above him. It differs from other shooters in that the player's two extra laser guns are located in the middle of the screen, protected by barriers on either side.<br><br>The enemies (guerillas) are initially located on the sides of the screen and will start moving inwards towards the laser guns. As they reach the barriers, they pick them up and return them back to where they came from. Once there's a hole through the barriers the guerillas will go for the extra laser guns. The player has to prevent them from doing this by shooting them. The player loses a life when the laser gun is carried all the way back to the edge of the screen or when killed by enemy fire. Two Space Invaders-style shields give some protection from fire. Additional enemies include the UFO moving across the top of the screen just like in Space Invaders and the mutant mole which appears attacking the player in the lower sections after every 500 points scored. It also got an official home port on the Sinclair ZX Spectrum.<br><br>This was part of Universal's Cosmic Monster series.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "November 1, 1979", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Universal Co., Ltd.", "publishers": "Universal Co., Ltd.", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.29", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFGkauaVcZ8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/35652"}
