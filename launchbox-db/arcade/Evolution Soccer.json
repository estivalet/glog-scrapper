The game uses four buttons and includes basic commands like pass/shoot on offence, slide/tackle on defence, turbo and special. The special button can be used by the team's captain to perform a special kick when his power meter is full.<br><br>The game features teams from 32 different countries and the tournament is organized with 16 teams in four different groups. The Mexican release of the game also features 18 Mexican club teams.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "2001", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Brezzasoft", "publishers": "Evoga Entertainment", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.42", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/36111"}
