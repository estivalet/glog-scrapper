{"name": "SegaSonic Popcorn Shop", "overview": "SegaSonic Popcorn Shop is a popcorn vending machine. It dispenses three flavors: salted, butter, and curry. The twist: it's also an arcade game. The player chooses their flavor, then begins the minigame. Gameplay consists of turning a crank to help Tails get the corn kernels over the fire while Sonic supervises. Whether the player succeeds or not, the popcorn is microwaved and dispensed.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega AM1 R&D Division", "publishers": "Sega Enterprises Ltd.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/114895"}
