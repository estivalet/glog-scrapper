The gameplay is largely similar to that NS2 (1991-93) era of Namco's own World Stadium series, in which both players must take controls for two of twelve real-life Japanese baseball teams in the Central and Pacific Leagues, then select one of four stadiums for the match to take place in - and two are carried over, from all the WS titles (but the K\u014dshien has been renamed, to the \"Urban\"), while the other two were created specifically in this game.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Namco", "publishers": "Namco", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/115002"}
