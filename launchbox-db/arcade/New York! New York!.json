{"name": "New York! New York!", "overview": "New York! New York! is a single screen shoot-em-up, where the city is under attack by aliens. You control a ground-based gun, and waves of ships fly overhead in patterns while freely dispensing missiles which may destroy your weapon. After 22 of these ships are destroyed, the UFO appears. Destroying the UFO advances you to the next level which looks remarkably similar to the previous level.<br><br>The US release of the game had a changed title screen and slightly different sound effects. A new Japanese release was prepared, as Waga Seishun no Arcadia (Arcadia of My Youth) in 1982, to take advantage of the anime film of that name. The most notable change in that release was a picture of Captain Harlock from the movie in place of the Statue of Liberty that was there previously. The title and ship graphics were also slightly modified but gameplay remained unchanged.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "December 1, 1980", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sigma Enterprises", "publishers": "", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.88", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/37852"}
