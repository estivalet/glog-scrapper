{"name": "Hammer Boy", "overview": "Hammer Boy is an arcade game that plays like a cross between Kaboom! and Whac-A-Mole.<br><br>Armed with a big hammer, your job is to prevent the American Indians from reaching the tower behind your fort by hitting them on the head and putting out the fires that are thrown from the side. That's really it to the game -- new levels bring different backgrounds (battleship, castle and space base) with corresponding enemies (pirates, knights and aliens), but essentially the same gameplay.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Dinamic", "publishers": "Dinamic", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTNjjUqfx_4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/105532"}
