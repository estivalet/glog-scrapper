It was ported to the Arcadia 2001 console. <br><br>The player controls a car and must explore a maze divided into sixteen rooms. The player must collect all the money bags while avoiding colliding with opponents' cars or running out of fuel. Every time the player goes out of a room, a map is shown, indicating the position of every car and all the money bags. There are also flags that can be driven over to invert the roles, so the player can crash the opposite cars and stop them for a few seconds, while getting bonus points.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sun Electronics", "publishers": "Centuri", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tk6e1gumb-c", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/38630"}
