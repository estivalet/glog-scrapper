{"name": "My Hero", "overview": "My Hero (Seishun Scandal in Japan) is a Sega video game released via arcade in 1985 and was later ported to the Sega Master System in 1986. The gameplay takes the form of a simple side-scrolling beat 'em up fighting game, which was seen as being frustratingly difficult at several points in the game.<br><br>The Arcade version consists of three different levels, each continuing in an endless loop until the player runs out of lives. It starts out with your character on a city street watching as a street thug runs off with your girlfriend. As you pursue him you must fight off gangs of other various street thugs. Halfway through the level, you have an opportunity to save a captive bystander who (if rescued) will help you fight until he is killed. Soon (after jumping across platforms and dodging fireballs) you will arrive on a beach and fight the thug that has captured your girlfriend. After you defeat the level boss by landing the allotted number of hits (10), you have completed the level. This same process repeats for the remainder of the game, only with two other bosses and stage designs. The second stage design resembles an Edo Japanese ninja epic, with ninja themed enemies and boss, followed by a sci-fi theme loosely based upon Planet of the Apes, including ape/human enemies and a boss.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Coreland", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.57", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUlSGAvXumU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/31204"}
