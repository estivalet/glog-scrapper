{"name": "Silent Scope", "overview": "Silent Scope was produced by Konami in 1999.<br><br>A shooting game where you battle terrorists and rescue hostages.<br><br>Using a mounted sniper-rifle peripheral, you can see targets up close and personal through the scope, or view them from a great distance on the arcade monitor. Taking out the enemies is tricky business, however. If you wait too long, you will be spotted and draw fire. If you are careless with your aim and miss, they will home in on your position. You will also have to monitor your ammunition carefully or you will be gunned down while reloading your rifle.<br><br>The game has three modes of play: Target Practice, Time Attack, and Story. Target Practice lets you practice your sniper skills; Time Attack challenges you to clear several stages with a fast time and a high accuracy rating; Story mode has a variety of intense missions. You will pick-off terrorists while perched atop a skyscraper, take down a thug who is carrying a hostage down a football field, hit moving targets while speeding down the highway, and even don a pair of night-vision goggles as you are dropped by parachute into an enemy compound.<br>Each mission has a tough boss enemy that requires a great deal of skill to take down. Your life meter will go down each time you are hit or accidentally kill an innocent by-stander. You can restore lost health by being a voyeur and sighting \"interesting\" side events.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/38876"}
