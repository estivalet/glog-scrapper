{"name": "Acrobat Mission", "overview": "In the year 2100, the Earth's environment is devastated by its inhabitants, who develop their space technology to live on Mars. Before they left, the humans created a Bio-Computer assigned to replenish Earth's ecosystem in hopes of returning to Earth. 50 years after terra-forming parts of Mars, the human colonists were attacked by mysterious, but hostile UFOs. The military leaders among the colonists set up an attack force to defend the colonists using state of the art fighter ships identified as the Icarus. The main operation of attack is called \"Acrobat Mission\" because it exceeds the technical flying ability of the pilots.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "UPL Co., Ltd", "publishers": "Taito America Corporation", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.9", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVlYLm-lKJQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/32427"}
