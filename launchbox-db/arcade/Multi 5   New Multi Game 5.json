{"name": "Multi 5 / New Multi Game 5", "overview": "This title contains 5 different games, one of which is a platform game, with the remaining four being puzzle games. They are:<br><br>Tong Boy (combines elements from both \"Donkey Kong\" and \"Donkey Kong Jr.\").<br>Bubble Gum (a clone of \"Puzzle Bobble\")<br>Cross Point (a clone of \"Columns\")<br>Box Logic (a clone of \"Logic Pro\")<br>Rocktris (a clone of \"Tetris\")<br><br>Both 'Cross Point' and 'Rocktris' feature adult content in the form of badly digitized pictures of naked women. Despite the colourful and nicely-rendered graphics of most of the games on offer, none manage to match the playability of the arcade originals on which they are based.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1998", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Yun Sung", "publishers": "Yun Sung", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.89", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/37757"}
