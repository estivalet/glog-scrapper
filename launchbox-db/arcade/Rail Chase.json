{"name": "Rail Chase", "overview": "Rail Chase is a 1st person perspective rail shooter where you play the role of an explorer (and assistant) who has discovered the Jewels of Guaramure and is now trying to escape with them from the locals. Your means of escape is a mine-cart and as you ride along you must use your gun to help you in your escape over various stages as you are being chased by a stage boss. There are various enemies and obstacles that must be shot so not to damage the mine-cart which slowly starts to show the damage you are taking. There are enemies on the side of the tracks, in mine-carts and on various other vehicles.<br><br>If you hit obstacles which include ice-blocks, fences and flame-throwers, then the boss will catch up to you shown by a bar on the top of the screen, showing the gap between you. The bosses have various weapons and must be shot to slow them down and to finally defeat them at the end of the stage. Occasionally you will come across a junction and you choose a direction with one of the path containing more obstacles and enemies. Life boxes can be collected to keep you going and boxes of TNT can be shot to destroy all on the screen. Two players can play at the same time on screen and play together to help each other.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "June 3, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.27", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/GQd3FFT7pnc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/38468"}
