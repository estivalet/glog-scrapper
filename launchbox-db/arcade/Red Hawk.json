{"name": "Red Hawk", "overview": "A vertical shooter. Fly over various planets and destroy as many buildings, tanks, planes, etc. as you can. At the end of each stage, you have to destroy a big space ship or monster in order to get to the next level.<br><br>When destroying semi-big objects, you can collect power-ups to increase your firing speed. After finishing all twelve stages, the game shows the credits page that contains the names and pictures of the developers.<br><br>While holding down the shoot button, the special weapon recharges and fires if it's completely loaded. The special weapon and the Big Bomb differ for each player: player two launches a big Ghost Bomber that blocks all enemy fire; player one shoots big discs across the whole screen. Watch out for the special power-ups located at the very end of both sides, almost out of the screen. These are better power-ups than normal. One of these is a Fire Cat upgrade that shoots automatically around your ship.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "AFEGA", "publishers": "AFEGA", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.97", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/7DESCcBG2pM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/38515"}
