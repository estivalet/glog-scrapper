Special Project Y has a variety of game styles over various levels which need completing to complete your mission.<br><br>You start off flying a Jet-Pack over the ocean from a 3rd person perspective flying into the screen towards the island with the baddies coming towards you.

There are Hang-Gliders and a huge Helicopter to contend with as well before landing on the island and onto the next stage which the game then becomes a Beat -em-up.
