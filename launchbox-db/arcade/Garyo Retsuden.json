{"name": "Garyo Retsuden", "overview": "Garyo Retsuden is a weird, overhead run-and-gun with a \u201cRomance of the Three Kingdoms\u201d motif. The heroes are three brothers: Liu Bei, Guan Yu, and Zhang Fei, as they set off to save the princess, held by Lu Bu. Each of them wields a different weapon \u2013 bow and arrow, axes, and throwing knives \u2013 but they all fundamentally play the same. Each level is filled with power-ups, including weapon upgrades, suits to absorb hits, and shoes to walk faster. There are also horses stationed regularly, which don\u2019t really do a whole lot, but can absorb a bit of extra damage, and can be healed by gobbling up the carrots that are just lying around.<br><br>This game appears to be a Japan-only release.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Data East", "publishers": "Data East", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "2.97", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH-4nLmr9VY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/36395"}
