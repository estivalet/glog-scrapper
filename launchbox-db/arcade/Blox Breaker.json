{"name": "Blox Breaker", "overview": "Blox Breaker is a carnival/midway-style arcade game that uses the \u201cMixed Reality\u201d concept of the player using a physical object that interacts directly with the digital world. Instead of throwing the balls at a physical target, a giant 65\u2033 screen shows a variety of targets and boxes that you aim for. By using specially encoded balls, the game is able to not only detect the precise angle and speed that the ball is going at, it knows it\u2019s color as well. This allows Blox Breaker to work for two-players at the same time, whereas other games in this genre have been limited to one player per screen.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/157017"}
