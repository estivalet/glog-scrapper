{"name": "Rad Action", "overview": "Ninja-Kid II, known in Japan as Ninja-kun Ashura no Sh\u014d and known in North America as Rad Action and JT-104, is a platform action video game first developed and published in 1987 by UPL in Japan. It is the direct sequel of Ninja-Kid. <br><br>Gameplay As with the original Ninja-Kid, the goal of each stage is to defeat the many enemies roaming around by first reaching them and then throwing ninja stars at them. Ninja-kun can also acquire scrolls that briefly give him stronger attacks, like a fire burst that takes out all nearby enemies. Each stage (or \"scene\") has a different layout, with some being merely a single screen (such as Scene 1) as well as larger vertically- and horizontally-scrolling stages. The enemies are usually different too, with increasing difficulty.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "UPL", "publishers": "UPL", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.37", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpz646tD6ag", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/37879"}
