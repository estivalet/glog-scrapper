Because the second official title in the series, Space Invaders Part II, was released in the U.S. as \"Space Invaders Deluxe\" as an update of the original, this American title was therefore given the naming of \"Space Invaders II\".", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1980", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Midway", "publishers": "Midway", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaQrVcRd1WU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/117052"}
