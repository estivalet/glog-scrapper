{"name": "TX-1", "overview": "TX-1 is a racing game created in 1983 by Tatsumi, formerly known as Tazmi. It is often considered a spiritual successor to Pole Position II, as it shares many features. TX-1 was the first arcade game to include force-feedback; the steering wheel vibrates in response to action on-screen. The arcade cabinet had three screens side-by-side, allowing for a panoramic view and a more three-dimensional perspective. TX-1 is also notable in that it allows the player to choose from multiple paths after each leg of the race (this gameplay feature would be copied by many other games, such as the 1986 game OutRun). The player must be careful to use a combination of letting off the gas, pressing on the brake, and downshifting while turning corners so as not to spin out or crash. The driving was designed to be more realistic than previous games in the genre.<br><br>A sequel, TX-1 V8, was released in 1984. Both TX-1 and its sequel were highly successful in Japan, where they were the top-grossing upright/cockpit arcade cabinets for a combined sixteen months between 1983 and 1985. However, the sequel was not licensed by Atari for North American release.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tatsumi", "publishers": "Atari", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.14", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkEp5wm1Cs0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/39869"}
