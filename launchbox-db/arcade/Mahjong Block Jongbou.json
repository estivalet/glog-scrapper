{"name": "Mahjong Block Jongbou", "overview": "Mahjong Block Jongbou is a combination of a Breakout-style arcade game and a Mahjong game. The player can either beat a level by removing all bricks from the screen or finish a valid Mahjong hand by collecting the falling bricks that turned to Mahjong pieces. In the original arcade version the player is rewarded with a picture of an anime-style girl in a sexy outfit after each level. These bonus pictures have been removed from the Nintendo Famicom version.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "SNK", "publishers": "SNK", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/37335"}
