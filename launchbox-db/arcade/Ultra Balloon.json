{"name": "Ultra Balloon", "overview": "Ultra Balloon was produced by SunA in 1996.<br><br> it's Bubble Bobble, except done like Parodius, right down to the penguin-as-a-main-character motif (they even look identical) and the rampant use of \"classical\" music from the public domain. It has enemies that capitalized on the then-megahot trend of wearing basketball goggles. REMEMBER THE BULLS. Anyway, it's such a blatant rip-off of a popular game, from a fly-by-night company that had absolutely no ties with Taito, using character designs by Famitsu artist Susumu Matsushita", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "SunA", "publishers": "SunA", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.16", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxZcb3DIrrs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/39882"}
