This entity then uses the time machine to travel back in time and destroy 3000 years of human history. The only resistance Huge-Boss faces is a group of pilots from different time periods who aim to stop him, although some of them have their own motives other than saving mankind.<br>Each fighter has a different shot pattern that can be upgraded or changed. There are also the side-weapon pick-ups including a pair of homing lasers, diagonal firing napalm and missiles.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Taito", "publishers": "Taito", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.92", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fPvWsMyfIE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/36402"}
