{"name": "Winning Run '91", "overview": "Winning Run '91 is a first-person racing arcade game that was released by Namco in 1991; it runs on the company's System 21 hardware, and is the third and final game in their Winning Run series. As with Winning Run, it does not allow up to four players to play it simultaneously when four single-player cabinets are linked together (like in Winning Run Suzuka Grand Prix) - and means that your position will again never change from 1/1 (regardless of how many CPU-controlled cars you pass).<br><br><br>As with the first two games, the player must take control of one of two cars (a blue one with automatic transmission and five different gears, and a red one with manual transmission and six different gears) in order to compete in a race; as mentioned above, you will be racing on your own once again (like in the original Winning Run), due to the fact that up to four players cannot play simultaneously. This title is also reminiscent of a single-monitor version for Driver's Eyes (which also ran on Namco System 21 hardware) - only it has the view of your car's dashboard in front of you, from the two previous games.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.38", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40151"}
