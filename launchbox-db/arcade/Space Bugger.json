{"name": "Space Bugger", "overview": "Space Bugger was produced by Game-A-Tron in 1981.<br><br>In this interesting take on the single-screen space shooter genre, you are in the center of the screen with aliens on both the left and right hand sides of the screen. You also have shields that help protect your ship (think Space Invaders but the shields are on both sides of your ship) from enemy fire. You can shoot from either side of your ship. Game plays like a horizontal version of Space Invaders but with enemies on both ends of the screen. And like in Space Invaders, the shields can eventually break down due to enemy (and your own) bullets.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Game-a-Tron", "publishers": "Game-a-Tron", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR47vvsIyck", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/38994"}
