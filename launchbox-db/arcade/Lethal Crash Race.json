{"name": "Lethal Crash Race", "overview": "Lethal Crash Race is, as the title suggests, a racing game. The player chooses one of eight international characters then races one-on-one against the other characters (and the recolor of her/his own). Each race takes place in a different location around the world, and each character has her or his own ending, making the character interaction rather similar to that of Sonic Wings.<br><br>Lethal Crash Race marks the first appearance of Ellen and Cincia, who later feature in most of the Sonic Wings games.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Video System Co., Ltd.", "publishers": "MoO'River", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.14", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5AjMDp7zKY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/37173"}
