{"name": "Daraku Tenshi: The Fallen Angels", "overview": "The earthquake that struck the city at 7:13 A.M. on February 10, 2000, measured 7 on the richter scale. The veneer of peace that had been maintained in the city's streets by total information control suddenly vanished, and the computer-controlled concrete jungle stopped functioning. A major shift in the Earth's crust had severed the city from its surrounding landform, leaving it an island with virtually no outside contact. Money-crazed inhabitants soon lashed out for the city's remaining but useless vestiges of power, preaching salvation while hiding their wicked motives. Sex, crime and drugs ruled the streets, as the city began to decay. Ironically, they called the wretched remains of their city \"Eden- the last paradise.\" It is now a decade later. The year is 2010.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Steel Hearts", "publishers": "Psikyo", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.76", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xZW6c2zsUs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/35806"}
