{"name": "Rush'n Attack (PlayChoice-10)", "overview": "PlayChoice-10 is an arcade machine which can consist of as many as 10 different games previously available only on the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) home console. The games for this system are in the modular form of circuit boards which are plugged into one of the ten open slots on the PlayChoice-10's motherboard.<br><br>There are four distinct sections of gameplay, taking in a Missile Base, a Harbour, a Bridge, and an enemy Prison Camp. Extra weapons with limited ammunition can be collected along the way, which will make the task a lot easier. The level is divided into 3 horizontal levels, which can be moved between either by jumping or using ladders, and this gives a chance to avoid the more threatening mobs of enemy fighters.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "2022", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami (Nintendo of America license)", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/cs0EZxEaDvA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/127799"}
