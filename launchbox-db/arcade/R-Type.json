The mission is to 'blast off and strike the evil Bydo Empire'. The significance of the R- in the series title refers to the production code as well as the term of endearment for the player fighter craft, the \"Round Canopy\".", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "July 1, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Irem", "publishers": "Irem", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.35", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVWtI0426mU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/5220"}
