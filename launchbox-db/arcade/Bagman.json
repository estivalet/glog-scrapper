{"name": "Bagman", "overview": "Bagman is an arcade platformer. The player controls the name-giving Bagman through several mine shaft levels composed of three screens each, his goal is to pick up money bags and put them into a wheelbarrow at the surface of the mine. Obstacles are pursuing guards, ore carts, and elevators. The only means of defence is a pickaxe, which stuns a guard temporalily. The same happens when the player manages to drop a money bag on top of a guard.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Valadon Automation", "publishers": "Valadon Automation", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.47", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB6viGFy5-8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/11674"}
