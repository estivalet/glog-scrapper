{"name": "Guitar Freaks 6th Mix", "overview": "A music simulation game where you play a large plastic guitar. Select a song, and try to play along as best as possible. Score well enough and you may select another song to play.<br><br>Just like in the other \"Bemani\" games, you follow along with the on-screen notes using the guitar controller's three buttons, and 'switch'. as the notes reach the top of the screen, hold down the corresponding button (red, green, or blue) and flick the switch on the body of the guitar, which simulates the guitar strings. Sometimes a guitar icon will come up the screen, and when it reaches the top, raising the guitar's neck vertically will give you a 'wailing bonus' Performing well enough will allow you to play an additional song.<br>Or, if so desired, you can participate in a 'session mode.' Guitar Freaks 6th Mix is compatible with Konami's 'multi-session base' which allows Guitar Freaks 6th Mix to be linked up with Drummania 5th Mix for 3 players playing at once! (two on Guitar Freaks 6th Mix, and one on Drummania 5th Mix.)", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bemani", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Music", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeqRUfqCxIk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/36597"}
