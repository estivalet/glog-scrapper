{"name": "Boogie Wings", "overview": "This is one of the most humorous shooters ever by Data East. One biplane had a hook at the rear with which you could swing it to catch lots of things in the scenery like enemies. One other particularity was that, if your plane was hit two times, it was destroyed and you then had to continue on foot. You could then take all kinds of vehicles like a bike, elephant, pogostick, etc. The stages were a museum with dinosaur skeletons, a fair with a mechanical Santa Claus turning into Satan Claus, etc.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Data East", "publishers": "Data East", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.87", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MG2sftrGAwI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/35252"}
