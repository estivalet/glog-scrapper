{"name": "Stunt Typhoon Plus", "overview": "The set up is pretty standard for a driving game, with the addition of an emergency brake handle to aid in power slides. You select a film to work on, and then you have to perform the stunt sequences (a la Stuntman on the PS2) racing through checkpoints, and avoiding/hitting objects as it requires. Although everything on the machine I played was in Japanese, it was still quite a lot of fun.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "2000", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/39209"}
