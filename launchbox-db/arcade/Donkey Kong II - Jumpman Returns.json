{"name": "Donkey Kong II: Jumpman Returns", "overview": "Jeff Kulczycki of ROM Hack created this game in 2006. It is a homebrew game having no affiliation with Nintendo and can be applied as a chip update to a Donkey Kong PCB. Adding the DK2 chipset allows you to switch from original Donkey Kong to DK2 via pressing both Player Start buttons followed by the Jump button.<br><br>The modded game offers a total of 8 levels. This includes the original 4 levels, with a few minor (clever) updates, and 4 new levels: Mixer, Foundry, Refinery, and Incinerator. I love the chip-swap implementation making this upgrade fairly easy for most owners. But what astounds me most is the visual integration of the 4 new levels!", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "2006", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jeff Kulczycki", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.69", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/DFbhI4Adr9s", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/115561"}
