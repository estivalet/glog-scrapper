{"name": "Yam! Yam!?", "overview": "Yam! Yam!? is a puzzle game where you have to push diamonds into trapdoors to complete each stage shown on a single screen within a time limit. You play the role of a bear type creature and you must move around the screen made up of blocks as walls that cannot be pushed. As well as the diamonds there are also other items that can be pushed like peppers and skulls and you can push multiple items at once either one square or as far as they will go. As you push the diamonds and peppers (for bonus points) into the trap doors be careful that you don't push the skulls in or you lose one of three lives and you also lose a life if the time runs out.<br><br>The game was produced in Korea only.", "platform": "Arcade", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dooyong", "publishers": "Dooyong", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFBYRMT_XJo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/32923"}
