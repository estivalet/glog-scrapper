{"altername_name": [], "name": "Atari Invaders", "overview": "Atari Invaders is a wonderfully simple, smooth, and colorful adaptation of the classic game Space Invaders. Better than many others. It says \"Insert JJoystick\" on this screenshot, but that's not a typo. If you wait long enough, an Invader comes out on screen to bomb the extra J away. This is an homage to the original \"Space Invaders\" coin-operated arcade game in which the writing \"Insert CCoin\" gets its extra C bombed. That's how truer to the arcade this one is than the others.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Joe Hellesen", "publishers": "Atari Program Exchange", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smvnxTVXazM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73672-atari-invaders\n"}
