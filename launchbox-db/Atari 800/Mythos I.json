The sun lost its light to the evil that now rules Vandor. Villages and towns are deserted, the once enticing forests are dangerous. Barren the valleys, forbidding the mountains, on whose slopes wine once fermented. When the night plunges the planet Vandor into black, one gathers in the stronghold and listens to the stories about the one who will set Vandor free again. So proclaimed Shandra the magician. But who dares to face the forces of darkness? Who is strong enough, clever and wise enough to interpret the few clues? Who dares enter the ice caves of Modra to find the king who left the land of Kruzia in grief and holds the key that could change everything? Shandra the magician foresaw all of this. Nobody listened to him. - But Shandra is also the only one who still believes in rescue. No treasures beckon to the capable, the one longed for, no other reward than to bring Vandor back to freedom and to know: Evil can be conquered! Are you strong enough, friend?
