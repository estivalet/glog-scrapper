{"altername_name": [], "name": "Reaxion", "overview": "The computer system of a nuclear power plant has been damaged by a virus, and you have to debug it before the plant would explode! This means in practice that there is a board consisting of tiles, on which you have to make every tile the same, as in turning either into a colored or uncolored state. You control a cursor, and if you click on a tile, that one and every other neighboring tile around it inverses its state. Each level starts with a different pattern, and there is a time limit too. Reaxion was originally released for the C64 in 1994 and Amiga in 1995; the original author later ported it to Atari 8bit in 2005. The game was sold commercially by retro sites at release.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "2005", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jason Kelk", "publishers": "Cosine Systems", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151137-reaxion\n"}
