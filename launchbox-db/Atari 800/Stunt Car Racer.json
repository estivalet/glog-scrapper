{"altername_name": [], "name": "Stunt Car Racer", "overview": "The game takes place on an elevated race track, with nothing to stop the player from accidentally driving off the side. Most tracks in the game have gaps that require timing to jump or risk falling off the track. If this occurs then the player's vehicle is hoisted back onto the track which costs valuable time. Turbo can be used to make a car go faster, but it can only be used for a limited amount of time in each race. Damage to the player's car occurs when the car collides or lands too hard on the track, and is indicated by cracks in the frame at the top of player view. If too much damage is taken the car is wrecked and the race is over. The Atari 8-bit version is a fan made conversion and runs on an Atari XE (128K) or emulator. Although based on the C64 code, it runs faster and supports exporting high scores to http://xxl.atari.pl/hsc/hsc-stunt-car-racer/", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "February 28, 2018", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Fandal", "publishers": "", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eRoMjirS3s", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/116674-stunt-car-racer\n"}
