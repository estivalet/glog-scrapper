{"altername_name": ["Jetboy, Return To Earth!"], "name": "Jetboy", "overview": "Jetboy is a adaptation of the popular ZX Spectrum game \"Jetpac\" from the 1980s. Jetman (or Jetboy, in this version) has crash-landed on a distant planet populated by various nasties, and he must escape and find his way home. Your first task is to retrieve each of the three parts of his spaceship, in order, and carry them over the base part. After this, you must collect enough fuel to be able to fly away, again by picking it up and dropping it over the ship. Once you've filled the ship up, you can fly on to the next level, in which you must again refuel. Each level contains various bad guys, with different attack patterns; you have a laser to shoot them for points, and must avoid contact with them. Diamonds can be collected for bonus points, and you get an extra life after every 10,000 points.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "2007", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Krzysztof Dudek", "publishers": "XXL", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jetpac", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/150541-jetboy\n"}
