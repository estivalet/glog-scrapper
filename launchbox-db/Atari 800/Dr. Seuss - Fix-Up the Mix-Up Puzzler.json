{"altername_name": ["Dr. Seuss's Fix-Up the Mix-Up Puzzler"], "name": "Dr. Seuss: Fix-Up the Mix-Up Puzzler", "overview": "On the screen are three images of Dr. Seuss characters (such as the Cat in the Hat, the Grinch and more...) standing upright next to each other. At the touch of a button all their parts (head, body, feet) are scrambled up and it's up to the player to put them back together again. The game board is displayed as a 3x3 grid. Only one piece may be 'held' at a time, leaving a blank space on the board which other pieces of the puzzle can move in to. Harder levels introduce concepts such as rotation to the mix. Matching two or three parts of any creature together produces an animated acknowledgment in the form of movement. Matching all the parts of all the creatures together wins.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "EC - Early Childhood", "developers": "", "publishers": "CBS Software", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148245-dr-seuss-fix-up-the-mix-up-puzzler\n"}
