{"altername_name": ["S.A.G.A. #6: Stange Odyssey"], "name": "Scott Adams' Graphic Adventure #6: Strange Odyssey", "overview": "S.A.G.A. #6: Strange Odyssey is an update of the text-only version. It had many additional features including: Hi-Res graphics, Text-to-Speech hardware support, upper- and lowercase support for display (but not for input). Gameplay is very similar to the original. You still used the same one or two word commands to move about and manipulate objects. The RETURN key toggled back and forth between graphics and text. The game begins with the player stranded on a tiny asteroid in a damaged spaceship. The player must use an alien teleportation device to travel to distant worlds, collect treasure, and find the materials to repair the spacecraft.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Scott Adams", "publishers": "Adventure International", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_Odyssey", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/160864-scott-adams-graphic-adventure-6-strange-odyssey\n"}
