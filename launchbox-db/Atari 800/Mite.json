{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mite", "overview": "Mite was originally released with the New Atari User disk from issue 83. However in 2008 the author, Jason Kendall, released an updated version with some bug fixes and some bonus timers to make gameplay more interesting. Mite is a basic boulder destruction game; the job is to shove boulders so they end up on a BDU (Boulder Destruction Unit). This is easier said than done, as wrong moves can end up with a boulder stuck in an irretrievable situation. Luckily the game has a \"nearly\" mode, allowing you to complete a level when there is still one boulder left.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jason P.
