{"altername_name": [], "name": "Baja Buggies", "overview": "A simple race game simulating off-road buggy racing in the Baja California desert. The game uses pseudo-3D perspective and behind-the-car view. As opposed to most of the racing games of the period, collisions with other buggies cause slowdowns rather than crashes. Other notable features include a speedometer and a race progress indicator.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dan Ugrin", "publishers": "GameStar", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baja_Buggies", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1bh40_U8hg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73871-baja-buggies\n"}
