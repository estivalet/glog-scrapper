{"altername_name": [], "name": "Excalibur", "overview": "Excalibur is a strategy game in which the player takes the role of legendary King Arthur. Britain is divided between 16 kingdoms, but because everyone wants to reign the whole country, a violent dispute is inevitable. So King Arthur manages his kingdom, builds up an army and prepares for the things to come. The majority of the game is spent in the menus of Camelot: Merlin's room (magic is used to put negative effects on other kingdoms, but usage is restricted), the treasury (all financial aspects including taxes and army management), the throne room (official communication with other kingdoms like paying tributes or declaring war), the round table (monitoring and managing the contentment of the knights; a revolution would be unhealthy) and the trap room (only used when the kingdom is under attack). Arthur can also move outside the city and visit his vassals or other kingdoms (the latter with non-friendly intentions). The last component is the battle system which, just like the rest of the game, is in real-time. Similar to Legionnaire; the player commands the army on a overhead map.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Atari", "publishers": "APX", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/144710-excalibur\n"}
