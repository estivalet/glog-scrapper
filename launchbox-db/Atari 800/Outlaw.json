{"altername_name": ["Howitzer"], "name": "Outlaw", "overview": "OUTLAW (also known as Howitzer) is a game of marksmanship played with joysticks. In OUTLAW, you face your opponent in a desert. Fortunately, you can hide behind cactuses to elude your opponent's bullets. You use your joystick to chase your opponent and to take aim, then to retreat out of range as he tries to gun you down first. The first to score ten hits is the winner. You can play OUTLAW against the computer or against another player. To compensate for different levels of skill, each side can play with handicaps; each game has eight variations.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1979", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "David Crane", "publishers": "APX", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/146112-outlaw\n"}
