{"altername_name": [], "name": "Stun Trap", "overview": "Stun Trap is a two-player spacecraft shooter, which may be played against another human or against the computer. The players occupy different sides of the screen separated by a barrier, which is impenetrable to ships but not to their missile weapons. Shooting an opponent will temporarily disable them, and cause this barrier to shift towards their side of the board. The aim is then to stun the opponent sufficiently often that the barrier traps them with no room to move, at which point you win the game. There are a few nuances to game-play. For instance, every missile shot causes hyperspikes to break out in the wall immediately behind it. These spikes are deadly to the touch, and can be used to restrict your opponent's movement. Also, while shooting at each other, either side may be occasionally attacked by rammers, space mines, streakers and smart bombs.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Affine Software", "genres": "", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/149319-stun-trap\n"}
