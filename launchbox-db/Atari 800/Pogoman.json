{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pogoman", "overview": "Pogoman is a 1-player arcade game for the Atari 400/800. The player controls a man on pogo stick, who must travel through town while avoiding a number of obstacles. In the first level, the player must jump over fire hydrants, mail boxes, and parked cars. The player gains bonus points by jumping up and turning off the lights in town. In the second stage, unicyclists, chickens, and cats are added to the mix to increase difficulty. In the third stages, birds swoop down upon the Pogoman to further harass his trip through town. The player starts with 5 lives, and gains an additional life every time they make a successful trip through town. If the player falls off their pogostick, they must repeat a portion of the town they have already completed.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Computer Magic", "publishers": "Computer Magic", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148054-pogoman\n"}
