{"altername_name": [], "name": "Darts (Blue Ribbon Software)", "overview": "Darts is a 1 - 2 player arcade darts game for multiple systems. Consists of 3 games: 501, Round the Board, and Cricket. The player has to position their dart using their direction keys, and then press space when they want to throw. The player has limited time to aim their throw, and the targetting crosshair constantly moves around during aiming. * In 501, the player enters a start score from 11 to 1001. Each player throws 3 darts, and must finish on a double. * In Round the Board, the player chooses a difficulty of singles, doubles, or trebles. Start at 1, and finish with outer bull followed by inner bull. * In Cricket, Player 1 tries to score as many runs as possible while Player 2 aims for the outer or inner bull. Player 1 continues to score until Player 2 has scored 10 wickets. The roles are then reversed and the player with most runs wins.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Blue Ribbon Software", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/369043-darts-blue-ribbon-software\n"}
