{"altername_name": [], "name": "Blaster", "overview": "Unfinished prototype for the 5200/8bit line that resembles the Death Star ground attack sequence from \"Star Wars\". It is unlikely \"Blaster\" would have been the final name. You are in a ship flying towards a horizon with many enemies and obstacles; you can shoot at enemies and fly around/through obstacles until your shield is depleted from hits. Enemies and objects are drawn in outline form with a pseudo-3D approach.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Vid Kidz", "publishers": "Unreleased Prototype", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/149737-blaster\n"}
