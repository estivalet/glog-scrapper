{"altername_name": [], "name": "Chop Suey", "overview": "Chop Suey is a one or two player martial arts fighting game. The joystick controls fighting moves by direction instead of buttons (due to joysticks at the time being single button); aside from left/right/up/down, the diagonal directions all signify an attack type. The button switches facing left to right and vice versa. Fighters have a pain bar instead of a health bar; when pain is full, the next attack will cause the target to collapse for a moment, and return with a smaller pain bar. After 8 such take downs the fighter is out of the fight. Occasionally during the match deadly scorpions will fall from vents on the ceiling; players must avoid them or suffer an instant take-down. The game is distinguished by large sprites proportionate to the screen which were not seen in other fighting games at the time. This game and Karate Champ (first arcade, then porting to C64, Apple II) proceeded other well known sprite fighting games like Street Fighter by several years.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Adam Billyard", "publishers": "Antic Software", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/108476-chop-suey\n"}
