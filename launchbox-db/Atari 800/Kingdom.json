{"altername_name": [], "name": "Kingdom", "overview": "Kingdom is an enhanced conversion of the game Hamurabi. The player is the ruler of a medieval kingdom and must try to lead it to prosperity. Like in the original the game is played in turns and each turn the player must select: How many acres of land to buy or sell How many bushels of grain to feed to his people How many bushels of grain to plant Various random events will try to throw the player off course in his calculations. Doing badly will lead the kingdom to ruin, but doing well can turn it into a large empire. Slight differences exist between different versions on different mainframes, including the ability to have the computer play the game itself and the ability to save the current state of the game to continue later on.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1980", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atari", "publishers": "Atari", "genres": "Life Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/368591-kingdom\n"}
