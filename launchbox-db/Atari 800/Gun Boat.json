{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gun Boat", "overview": "Gunboat is a simple game where you have to cross a river in a speedboat. However, you have to avoid other boats that shoot at you. Despite the game's name, this is more of an \"avoid it/collect 'em up\" game than a shooter as you can't shoot yourself. The only thing you can do is avoid the enemy fire in order to collect bags of cash and other things in the river.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "General Masters Corporation", "publishers": "ALA Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQmgyeSMHX0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148225-gun-boat\n"}
