{"altername_name": [], "name": "Deflector", "overview": "Published in Compute! Magazine in May of 1983. You'll find that this game is quite a brainteaser. Strategically placing your Deflector and predicting a bouncing ball's trajectory is no easy task. If you like realtime strategy, Deflector's dynamically changing play field will provide hours of challenging fun. A ball bounces from side to side or from top to bottom of the screen. Pressing the left arrow key above the control key will print a slash in front of the ball's path, deflecting it 90 degrees. The FT key will print a backslash (\\). Your goal is to deflect the ball into the square targets, using as few slashes as possible to achieve the highest score. Scoring is ten points for every block hit, minus one point for every slash used and minus five points for every slash on the screen if you hit the panic button. The panic button is the British pound sign {\u00a3). If you get too many slashes on the screen or deflect yourself into a corner, hitting the panic button will remove all slashes, subtract five points per slash, and resume the game.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Frank J.
