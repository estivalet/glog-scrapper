{"altername_name": [], "name": "Leapster", "overview": "You play the part of a school boy, Henry Leapster, who's quest is a simple one: to get to school on time! To do this, he must travel across town, through houses, a missile base (weird town this!), a grave yard and finally to school. On each screen you must collect a certain number of objects to progress to the next screen, whilst being pursued by cars, missiles, troops, zombies (no, NOT THE TEACHERS!!) etc . . . in order to collect objects. You may have to jump on top of other objects to reach them (Henry certainly lives up to his name!) but take care, or else you'll soon end up an Ex-School Boy, bereft of life, you'll rest in peace!!! On the final screen, all you have to do to reach the classroom is avoid the paper planes, arrows and springs that drop from the corridor above.
