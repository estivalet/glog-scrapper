{"altername_name": ["The Deadly Game"], "name": "SoftSide Adventure of the Month 17: The Deadly Game", "overview": "The Deadly Game is the seventeenth in a series of monthly text adventures for multiple systems. A note arrives at your doorstep one summer evening. Your uncle Sir Henry Vanderbilt from the province of Burmesia has passed. You have been invited to the reading of his will in one weeks time. Upon arriving at your Uncle Henry's mansion in Burmesia, you meet a number of your snobby relatives whom you had hoped to never meet again. Uncle Henry's will states that each of you is to receive one million dollars, on the stipulation that you spend the night in his mansion. He further notes, that if anyone does not spend the night, or is deceased by the morning, the remaining money will be split among the surviving inheritors. Being a group of money loving degenerates, the inheritors begin to go about killing each other off. The player starts in their room, and must avoid tarantulas and poisonous gas. As the player explores the mansion, numerous deathtraps must be avoided, most of which are unpredictable before the player's death. All commands are via 2-word VERB NOUN entries, and game play contains several object puzzles. There is no save and restore feature.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "SoftSide Publications", "publishers": "SoftSide Publications", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/368977-softside-adventure-of-the-month-17-the-deadly-game\n"}
