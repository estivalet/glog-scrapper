{"altername_name": [], "name": "Jinks", "overview": "You are about to embark on one of the most dangerous missions of your career. As a renowned Star Fleet pilot, you have been selected to command an exploration party in a journey across the galaxy to investigate the mysterious planet JINKS. An enigma for centuries, JINKS is a lush, resource-rich world, and could be the key to the desperate need for human expansion in space. It is apparently capable of supporting life, yet it is curiously uninhabited--or is it? A routine research mission goes haywire when scouting your probe across the planet's surface leads you and your crew into a deadly game of cat and mouse. Can you escape from these fiendishly clever traps before your probe and its occupants are miniaturized or annihilated? Reportedly, this game was first developed in the mid 80s, which would make it more appropriate as a sort of expanded Breakout. However, it was shelved, then asked to be made into a cartridge version, then much later released for the Atari 7800 (a game that is considered one of the worst on the system). Then apparently the old 8-bit version was updated and released in 1991 in Germany by AMC-Verlag.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Rainer Kothe", "publishers": "AMC-Verlag", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148826-jinks\n"}
