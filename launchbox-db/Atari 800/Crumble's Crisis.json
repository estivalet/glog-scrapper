{"altername_name": [], "name": "Crumble's Crisis", "overview": "Dozens of alien Fuzzies (30 to be exact) have escaped from the Intergalactic Zoo and Crumble has to travel through the 5 levels of the multi-verse to find and snare the Fuzzies in containment cages. Crumble is equipped with a back-pack Hover Unit to enable him to move quickly around the caverns of the multi-verse. He must avoid touching most of the walls (composite anti-matter very deadly!) but there are 'safe' areas which are okay to walk on. Ghosts, Goblins and Evil Weevals all attempt to hinder his progress and drain his energy packs and these become more obnoxious as you advance through the five zones. It's also wise to keep moving or Time-Lightning will strike at your energy packs and drain them with remarkable speed. Luckily, extra energy can be obtained by collecting suitable items scattered around the multi-verse. The Fuzzies have a sick sense of humour and have hidden themselves in the most dangerous locations imaginable. Rounding them up could prove to be quite an achievement. There are certain tricks you must learn to help you negotiate the zones but, if all else fails, there is a practice option available after level one to help you test out your ideas.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Ivan Mackintosh", "publishers": "Red Rat Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/145628-crumbles-crisis\n"}
