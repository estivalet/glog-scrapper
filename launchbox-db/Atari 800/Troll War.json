{"altername_name": [], "name": "Troll War", "overview": "A game by Scott Langston and published in A.N.A.L.O.G. Computing Magazine issue 45 from August of 1986. Your king watches over his lands from the lower lefthand corner of his realm. The force field protecting him and the countryside from invasion is at his far right. You've just been promoted to the rank of Gunner First Class. As such, you've taken a position on the left flank of the treasure room above the king. To your right is open battlefield. The task before you is to guard the royal treasure. It supplies power to the force field, keeping the enemy at bay. The atomic weapon you control is your key to success. Warring trolls will appear at the screen's right. They race across the terrain in an effort to capture the treasure, for they know its value. A single energy bolt is adequate to disintegrate a charging troll. One hundred valor points will be awarded for each enemy annihilated. Should one of the trolls slip past you, he will steal some of the treasure, then turn to watch you frantically fight his allies. If another troll manages to gain the same position as the first in the treasure room, the king's force field will weaken. The opposing trolls will then be able to push the force field back toward the king. The game is over when the royal force field disappears.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "August 1, 1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Scott Langston", "publishers": "ANALOG Computing", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148964-troll-war\n"}
