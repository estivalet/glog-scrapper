{"altername_name": [], "name": "Money Hungry", "overview": "A collect'em-up game from Donald Murphy published in A.N.A.L.O.G. magazine issue 22 from September 1984. In Money Hungry, you play the part of a thief trying to collect as much money as possible, while making every effort to avoid the police. You are placed in a maze, with coins scattered all around. You pick up the coins by moving over them. Once on every board, a money bag appears, containing a 100 coin bonus. Your score, in coins, is shown at the bottom of the screen. There are three police patrolling the maze, and if they catch you five times, the game is over. The number of tries you have remaining is shown at the lower left of the screen. You can block the police by placing doors in the maze. To do this, press the joystick button while moving through the maze. A red door will appear, and the police can't get through it. You have four such doors and can reopen them at any time simply by running over them. Once you pick up a door, you can reuse it by pressing the joystick button again. When you have picked up all of the coins in the maze, you will move to the next level. In each level, either you or the police will increase in speed. Good luck!
