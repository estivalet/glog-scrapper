{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gold Rush!", "overview": "Published in Compute! Magazine in July 1982. In this game yon have live miners to dig as much ,gold as you can from the Lost Goldmine. Each miner has ten sticks of dynamite (charges) lo blast his way into the mine. The miner gathers them by moving to the same space as the dot. The number of pieces of gold is counted and displayed at the bottom of the screen. The number of charges left is also displayed at the bottom of the screen. After gathering all the gold you can, you must move (nit of the mine lo the Assay Office (the heart) to exchange the gold for money. When you touch the heart, the gold is exchanged for money at the rate of Gold times Remaining Charges. That all sounds easy enough, but there are several things that can hap[:en to slow up your\" progress. First, there are the cave-ins. Since the Lost Goldmine is very old, cave-ins occur every time you blast.These cave-ins can block your way out or (how can I put this nicely) ah... put you out of the game. When you are caved-in upon, your gold is lost and the miner is replaced with an asterisk. If you can reach the asterisk, you regain all of the gold the \"dead\" miner had. Another danger can beset you if you should use up all of your charges. When this happens, you have only a short time to get back to the surface. If you cannot exit the mine, either due lo a cave-in or a slow miner, then all is lost and you end up wandering the mine forever. Let's plug in our joysticks and strike it rich.
