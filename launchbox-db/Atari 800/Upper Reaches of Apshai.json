{"altername_name": ["Dunjonquest: Upper Reaches of Apshai"], "name": "Upper Reaches of Apshai", "overview": "Upper Reaches of Apshai is an expansion module for Temple of Apshai, featuring a new dungeon (four levels with 150 rooms), and even something like a background story: You have to discover the secrets of Benedict's monastery and the cottage of Merlis the Mage. Otherwise, gameplay is pretty much the same and resembles other graphical Roguelikes / mainframe DND-Clones: You're in control of a solo character, running through a dungeon, killing monster, getting experience, evading traps and finding treasures.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "DLC", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Automated Simulations", "publishers": "Epyx", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunjonquest#Upper_Reaches_of_Apshai_%28September_1981%29", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/146526-upper-reaches-of-apshai\n"}
