{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cribbage & Dominoes", "overview": "Cribbage & Dominoes is a compilation of two previously released games for the 8-bit Atari. Cribbage is a 1-player versus computer cribbage game. Cards and the cribbage board are graphically displayed on the screen. The player is required to count their own points after each hand, and the computer judges if the player's count is in agreement. In Dominoes, each player starts with 6 dominoes. The player with the highest double plays first. Each player adds to the leading edge of the dominoes if they have a tile that matches that displayed on the screen. If they don't have a correct tile, they must draw one from the boneyard.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Thorn EMI Computer Software", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/167007-cribbage-dominoes\n"}
