{"altername_name": [], "name": "Crypto Cube", "overview": "20 themed words are arranged in criss-cross formation over the faces of a three-dimensional cube. You have to guess and uncover them. A mascot- The Wuzzle- apprises you of your progress. When uncovering the words, you will get: a blank square- no points and the turn is over; a vowel- 5 points and another turn; a consonant- you get a question mark and must guess the letter- a correct guess nets 10 points and another turn, an incorrect guess -5 points and the turn is over. There are also bonus squares that let you pick an extra square on the current cube-side, as well as one on another side. New word lists can be added by the user- ostensibly to allow children to practice their spelling homework.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "DesignWare, Inc.", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/144957-crypto-cube\n"}
