{"altername_name": [], "name": "Space Shuttle: A Journey into Space", "overview": "Space Shuttle is a simulation game where you are the pilot of space shuttle Discovery. Your goal is to launch the Discovery, establish an orbit around the Earth, open the cargo bay doors and recover a satellite to perform repairs, and finally land the Discovery successfully, all while using as little fuel as possible. Each time the complete mission is accomplished, it will then repeat at a higher difficulty level (in the higher difficulty levels the satellite has a more erratic flight path).", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Activision", "publishers": "Activision", "genres": "Flight Simulator", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle:_A_Journey_into_Space", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/BhCxJDjNrrs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72167-space-shuttle-a-journey-into-space\n"}
