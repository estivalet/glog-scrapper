{"altername_name": [], "name": "Knockout", "overview": "Ready to match reflexes with your Atari, mano-a-mano? Sports Illustrated lent its name to this early boxing simulation, which gives you an elevation of the ring and two boxers throwing three different punches. Matching your opponent's punch makes a block; each unblocked punch is a point. At least thirty head-shots in a round may earn you a technical knockout, but that's the only knockout available. Otherwise it's five to fifteen rounds, which at three minutes per round can give you a genuine endurance contest. Wear down a friend or just a single joystick, or allow the microprocessor to take both boxers. The footwork is simple, back-and-forth, but like in the real ring, probably the key to championship. Score, rounds, and time are displayed large enough above the play window to let a quick glance tell you where you are, but your boxer will also grunt and drop his jaw each time he gets hit. If you see a lot of that, the bell will be a welcome sound, not to mention the thirty seconds' rest between rounds.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Microcomputer Games", "publishers": "The Avalon Hill Game Company", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/168021-knockout\n"}
