{"altername_name": [], "name": "Risky Rescue", "overview": "In Risky Rescue, you can play the part of a creature named Igneous. Your archenemy, Greedo the goblin, has kidnapped your sweet baby Iggy and holds him captive in his creepy caves. He\u2019s put Iggy in a trance, and your only hope of rescuing the baby is to get medicine from three medicine pots and then touch him. To get medicine from a pot, land on it. Meanwhile, Greedo is throwing deadly arrows at you. The best way to avoid them is usually to move up and hover while they fly by. Sometimes, though, there\u2019s no room to maneuver, so you must use careful timing to get through the tight spots. You control Igneous with a joystick. To move left or right, push the stick in that direction. If you go off the screen on one side, you'll reappear on the other. To move up, hold the fire button down and push the stick forward. Pressing the trigger turns on a mechanism that lets you hover at a constant altitude. If you push the stick forward, you are propelled upward. You need to push the stick each time you want to move up one space.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "J. D.
