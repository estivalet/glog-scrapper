{"altername_name": ["Up Up and Away"], "name": "Up Up & Away", "overview": "Up Up and Away is a horizontal scrolling game where you have to fly a hot air balloon from base to base avoiding obstacles such as clouds, trees, kites, birds and people throwing rocks. You have a limited supply of sandbags and fuel and these decrease the higher the difficulty level is (0-5). Moving the balloon upwards consumes fuel so careful control needs to be observed. Sandbags can be used to hit people or hit icons with the letter P to improve your score. Refuelling stations to land on are also along your route. The keyboard or a joystick is used to control the balloon.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ringblack Software", "publishers": "Starcade Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djrNpHQbjvc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/146686-up-up-away\n"}
