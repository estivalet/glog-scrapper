{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sea Horse Hide'n Seek", "overview": "Sea Horse Hide'n Seek is an educational action game for children. 1 or 2 players can participate. You have to help a little seahorse to get to the shipwreck at the far right of the screen, while avoiding lagoon-fishes which try to take the seahorse out of the screen. The seahorse can hide in tunnels, automatically bringing the seahorse to a different location. However, there is always an octopus hiding in a cave. The seahorse can also hide in corals, as long as they match the seahorse's colour.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Joyce Hakansson Associates", "publishers": "CBS Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148249-sea-horse-hiden-seek\n"}
