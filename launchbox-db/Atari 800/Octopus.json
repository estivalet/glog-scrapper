{"altername_name": [], "name": "Octopus", "overview": "This is an adaptation of the Nintendo Game and Watch handheld of the same name (from 1981). Gameplay is the same and considerable effort was made to match the display characteristics of the original (although with more color). Three scuba-divers head for a treasure under the sea, guarded by the Octopus. The divers must be patient, because the Octopus's arms are moving randomly. The player earns one point for every piece of treasure they grab and three points for returning the load to the boat. As the player progresses in the game, the Octopus's arms will move faster.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "2011", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Arkadiusz Lubaszka", "publishers": "ArSoft", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Game_%26_Watch_games#Octopus", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151007-octopus\n"}
