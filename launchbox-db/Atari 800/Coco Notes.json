{"altername_name": ["Coco-Notes"], "name": "Coco Notes", "overview": "A musical game with four modes: Catch a Coco-Note - Pick notes out of a pool with your fishing pool. Once you've picked enough you can hear the band play the melody you've picked out. Composin' Coco-Notes - Same game as the first, except now played with an accompaniment. Beat The Clam - Race against a clam trying to claim notes from the pool and get a high score while finishing the song. Collect bonus notes for extra score and avoid the clam as he'll eat your fishing line as well. Beat The Clam -- Challenge - Same game as above except the clam is much faster.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "The Dovetail Group", "publishers": "CBS Software", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148244-coco-notes\n"}
