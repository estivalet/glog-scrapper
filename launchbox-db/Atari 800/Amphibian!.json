As the game progresses it not only gets faster but other creatures begin to affect the playfield; birds come in and drop the apples the player needs, and a predator climbs the tree forcing the player to jump off or move around quickly.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Business Data Center", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_CgahzLqSU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/149691-amphibian\n"}
