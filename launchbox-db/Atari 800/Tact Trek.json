The player's ship, Enterprise, is always displayed in the center of the screen while enemy vessels approach. The ship is armed with phasers and torpedoes. Torpedoes must be armed into individual tubes before fired, and each command requires a specific amount of time to deploy. The player can lock onto the enemy vessel, or manually fire their weapons. The player must also control the heading of their vessel, and can launch probes, scan enemy vessels, and alter the energy distribution to their shields and weapons.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Robert Zdybel", "publishers": "APX", "genres": "", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/368804-tact-trek\n"}
