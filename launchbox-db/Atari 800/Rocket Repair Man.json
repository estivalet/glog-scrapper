Get into your space-suit, strap on your jet pack, and begin the most terrifying descent imaginable. Played from a side perspective, the player navigates a series of tight caverns to gather all items for their rocket ship. The player can fire horizontally, and move in all directions, but steadily falls downwards. The spaceman can only hold 1 item at a time, which must be brought back to the launchpad. The suit has limited power, and it's game over after hitting too many enemies or walls. The suit also has limited oxygen, but this is replenished for each item returned to the launchpad. It's game over when the suit's integrity reaches 0.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Red Rat Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/146556-rocket-repair-man\n"}
