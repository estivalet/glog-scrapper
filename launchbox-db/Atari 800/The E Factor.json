{"altername_name": [], "name": "The E Factor", "overview": "The E Factor is an arcade game for the Atari 8-bit computers. Every planet in the universe has en \"E Factor\", which represents the amount of energy each planet possesses. Matter can neither be created nor controlled, but it can be converted into energy, and through this process dissipated. Certain planets have consumed almost all of their energy producing materials, and are in desperate need of fuel replacement. Your assignment is to deliver a massive \"energy capsule\" to each of these planets before their fuel runs out and the inhabitants are frozen to death. From the navigation screen, the player must move to all 4 planets present on the space chart. Each quadrant has unique dangers including empty space, asteroids, Mondrogor Starfighters, and the planets themselves. The arcade portion is played from a top-down perspective, where the player controls a yellow starship that can move in all directions. The screen and dangers scroll vertically from above. A small green energy capsule is also present on the screen. The player's only ability is to make the capsule move towards the player, by pressing the joystick button. If the capsule touches the starship or any other object on the screen, the player loses a life. Furthermore, if the starship comes in contact with any enemy other than Mondrogor Starfighters, which directly try to attack the energy capsule, the player loses a life. The player has 5 lives, and if all are lost, it's game over.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Cosmi", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmDRyyUhQHQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73939-the-e-factor\n"}
