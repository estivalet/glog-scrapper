{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cybor-Stien", "overview": "Those naughty villagers from down the hill below the castle have taken your master the mad professor captive and are going to do some really horrendously horrid things to him, so you (Gregor his hunchback servant) must rescue him. But you can't because the villagers would probably do some pretty bad things to you as well. So instead you are going to have to find all of the pieces of the professors latest unfinished project, the CYBOR-STIEN MONSTER and put it together so that it can rescue him instead (it was this monster that upset the villagers in the first place just because he used some of their children and pets as spare parts some people have no sense of humor ). But the pieces of the monster are all in the dark ghost and skeleton infested dungeons which means it won't be that easy to get them. If you are a particularly small and weedy example of a Gregor then you can use the cheat mode below. Fress shift-control-0 on the title screen, when you start playing the message \"cheat mode\" should appear.If you get stuck somewhere you can press ESC to kill yourself.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dax Programmes", "publishers": "B.Ware Software", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/145948-cybor-stien\n"}
