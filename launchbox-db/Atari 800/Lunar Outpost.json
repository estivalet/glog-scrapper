{"altername_name": [], "name": "Lunar Outpost", "overview": "The Zytron Strike Force is attacking the Lunar Outpost! Without this final garrison, Earth lies open to their assault. Use your Infrared Enemy Detector to pinpoint the Zytron's location. Then race across the moon searching your Lunar Map for the enemy. When you have found them, it's time to switch to the battlefield screen for 3 dimensional combat! Maneuver your Lunar Assault Vehicle under the Zytron ships by moving in any of four directions. Blast them out of the sky as you try to dodge their nuclear barrage. If you're hit or are low on fuel, do you have time to service your vehicle? Can you afford to stand and fight, or is it better to sacrifice this territory to protect another? What is the best strategy? Program the battle to last from 1 to 28 days, each day being more challenging than the previous one. Can you last the lunar month? It's going to take strategy and wits--hurry, the future of the Lunar Outpost is in your hands! - 3rd Generation Action-Strategy Space Game - 3-D Arcade Type Graphics - Three Skill Levels - Two Play Screens - Scrolling Lunar Map - 3-D Battlefield - JOYSTICK CONTROLLED - One Player.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Epyx", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148164-lunar-outpost\n"}
