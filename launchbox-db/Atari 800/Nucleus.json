{"altername_name": [], "name": "Nucleus", "overview": "NUCLEUS War has not been allowed under Galactic Federation Law, since the great interplanetary war of 2450AD when seven inhabited planets were destroyed. Ever since then, it has been law that all major inter\u2014planetary disputes be resolved in the massive Combat Arena located in the unstable OMAC sector of the galaxy far away from any intelligent life. GAMEPLAY To be victorious in the OMAC Arena, you must neutralise your opponents forcefield by directing a nuclear satellite into it. To achieve this, a hole big enough for the satellite to fit through must first be made in your opponent's titanium shield. Each side is equipped with an Arena Craft which is fitted with Energy Bolt Launchers. These affect the direction and velocity of nuclear satellites when contact is made. All nuclear satellites contain a fast rotating nucleus which, when shot ten times, will become atomically unstable.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Paul Marshall", "publishers": "Atari", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/145683-nucleus\n"}
