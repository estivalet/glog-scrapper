{"altername_name": [], "name": "Knicker Bockers", "overview": "Poor ol' Knick, all he wants to do is play. He has even found the perfect place for it, an old abandoned door factory. He just loves to go around flipping and kicking the doors all around the room until he makes them into nice, colored little boxes. But no, he could not be left alone to his play, he is constantly menaced by the local toughs. \"Wild Bill\" and his nasty band of Grugs. They would like nothing better than to get a hold of Knicks and put a stop to his door flipping fun- forever. Now Knick must run from room to room , making boxes while he can and at all times avoiding \"Wild Bill\" and the Grugs, just so he can have the fun he so desperately desires. Can he do it? Well, that's up to you, isn't it?", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "TDC Software Inc.", "publishers": "TDC Software Inc.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/87679-knicker-bockers\n"}
