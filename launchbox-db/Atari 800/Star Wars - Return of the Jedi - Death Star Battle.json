{"altername_name": ["Star Wars: Return of the Jedi"], "name": "Star Wars: Return of the Jedi: Death Star Battle", "overview": "Death Star Battle is loosely based on the events of the film Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi. Your task is to destroy the Death Star before its construction is finished. You start the task outside the shield perimeter of the Death Star. There you'll have to combat different imperial vessels and avoid the death ray while waiting for an opportunity to slip through one of the random openings in the energy shield. After reaching the Death Star you must reduce its structure up to the point where you can hit the core. In the following destruction of the station you must avoid collision with Death Star debris. After completion the game will restart with increased difficulty (faster enemies, faster Death Star build up, etc). Overall difficulty can also be adjusted before starting the game.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Parker Brothers", "publishers": "Parker Brothers", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_of_the_Jedi:_Death_Star_Battle", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMmYXBAnVow", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/114722-star-wars-return-of-the-jedi-death-star-battle\n"}
