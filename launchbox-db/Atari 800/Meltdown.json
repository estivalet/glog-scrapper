{"altername_name": [], "name": "Meltdown", "overview": "Meltdown is a 1 - 2 player Frogger clone for the Atari 8-bit computer. In the middle of the night at the Megalopolis nuclear power generating plant, all hell has just broken loose in the control room. The coolant system is failing, the cores are boiling, and unless the tremendous heat of the nuclear reaction in all five reactors can be dissipated, the reactors may begin go melt down. The player can move in the 4 cardinal directions. They must move from their starting point avoiding radioactive mist and clouds, dash through a corridor containing bolts of atomic energy, and then through a series of moving floors (most if which disappear when stepped on) to reach the reactors. There, the player must extract the uranium core and return it to the lead box at the start of the level. A temperature gauge on the bottom of the screen continues to count upwards, and if it reaches 5200F, it's game over. Each rescued reactor will reduce the temperature. If the player is able to save all 5 reactors, they are able to move to a more challenging level. There are a total of 10 levels. The player starts with 3 lives, and if all are lost, it's game over.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Cosmi", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/144596-meltdown\n"}
