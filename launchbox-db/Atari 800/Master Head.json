{"altername_name": [], "name": "Master Head", "overview": "Master Head is a variant of Soko-Ban. On each level, the player, as a warehouse keeper, must push around crates to get them onto the right spots. Once all crates are moved onto a marked spot, the level is complete. Crates can only be pushed one at a time and cannot be pulled. A single wrong move can be undone with the P key. If the player gets stuck, it is possible to restart the level, but it causes the player to lose a life.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Union Software Of Silesia Rousers", "publishers": "Sonix Software", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147282-master-head\n"}
