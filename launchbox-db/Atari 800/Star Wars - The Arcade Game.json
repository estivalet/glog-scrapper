{"altername_name": [], "name": "Star Wars: The Arcade Game", "overview": "Remember the exhilaration you felt near the end of Star Wars when Luke Skywalker destroyed the Death Star? With Star Wars: The Arcade Game for the Atari 5200, you can enjoy the experience all over again, but this time you get to take Skywalker's place at the helm of the X-wing Fighter! Your spaceship, which you see as though you were sitting in its cockpit, is equipped with a maximum of nine energy shields. Each time you run into an obstacle (fireball, tower or catwalk) you will lose a shield, but you can earn extra shields by destroying the Death Star. If you get hit when your shield count is zero, the game will end. Prior to taking a shot at the Death Star, you must battle wave after wave of Imperial TIE Fighter patrol ships that are swarming around the artificial planet. You must destroy the entire fleet while shooting at and avoiding a barrage of fireballs. Next, you must fly through a maze of laser towers that stretch from the Death Star up into the blackness of outer space. The fireballs make a return engagement, and you can shoot the tops off the towers for bonus points.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "July 1, 1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Parker Brothers", "publishers": "Parker Brothers", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_(1983_video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0K55y86o8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/114720-star-wars-the-arcade-game\n"}
