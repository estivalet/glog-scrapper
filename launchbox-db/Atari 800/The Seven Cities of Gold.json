{"altername_name": ["Seven Cities of Gold"], "name": "The Seven Cities of Gold", "overview": "In The Seven Cities of Gold the player takes on the role of Christopher Columbus and the later Spanish conquistadors, exploring the New World (or a randomly generated map). As the player establishes forts and missions, bringing back gold to Spain, he or she would receive promotions from the Queen of Spain. The game features a large world to explore and comes up with some arcade sequences to simulate the interaction of the Natives and Spanish who did not speak the same language. The historical map accurately spreads out the Native population of the New World in 1492 and some historical situations can be simulated, such as whether to get the gold of the Aztec and Incas by trade or conquest.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ozark Softscape", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.8", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seven_Cities_of_Gold_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/3PqNwCjfXhM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72132-the-seven-cities-of-gold\n"}
