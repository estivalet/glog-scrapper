{"altername_name": [], "name": "Space Gunner / Mutant Bats", "overview": "The Earth is under attack! Flying saucers from Procryn 5 as assimilating its molecular structure for use back on their planet. They must be stopped! Strapped into your rocket suit, you cruise high into the stratosphere, waiting to blast the Alien ships to smithereens; but watch out for the Ram Star if you want to get back alive! The player controls a spaceman who can fly in all directions and fire horizontally. Alien saucers fly about stripping pieces of the ground away. The player tries to shoot all saucers. The saucers are harmless for the player, but the Ram Star will intermittently fly across the screen, and will take the player's life if hit. Contain the bonus game Mutant Bats, an arcade game where the player bounces a ball off a horizontally moving bat at the bottom of the screen. The goal is to destroy all blocks located above. Every missed ball costs a life.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Lynne Rowlingson", "publishers": "Red Rat Software", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/368778-space-gunner-mutant-bats\n"}
