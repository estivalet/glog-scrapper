The release includes two games:- Memory Mania is a tile-sliding puzzle game. A picture is split into a number of separate tiles, from 4 - 64, and randomly shuffled. The player must restore the individual photo by sliding the rows and columns of tile pieces. Initially came with 3 photos: deer, cube, and desert. The game tracks the number of moves made to solve a puzzle, and the player can save a puzzle in progress. Maxwell's Demon is based upon the second law of thermodynamics, but in this case the goal is to prove it wrong. The player controls James Clerk Maxwell's imaginary demon which sits upon the gate of separation between two molecules, by attempting to separate a system of fast moving hydrogen and slow moving helium atoms by opening and closing a gate that separates two chambers. The gate can be moved vertically, and can be briefly opened to allow molecules through. The goal is to separate all the atoms in the system.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mark Riley", "publishers": "Datasoft", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/369040-maxwells-demon-and-memory-mania\n"}
