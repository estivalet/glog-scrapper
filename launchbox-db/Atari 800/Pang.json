{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pang", "overview": "Pang is an action game similar to Dyna Blaster and Bomberman for up to two players. The goal of the game is to kill all the living beings in the maze and find the doors to the next level before the time runs out. The player has only time-bombs at his disposal and he may use them to blow out the walls and kill the enemies. When the player knocks down a part of the wall, it may reveal a hidden door and bonus items, such as increased bomb power (thunder icon), speed up (S icon), extra energy (cross icon) or surprise package. The contact with the enemies and exploding bomb means a large loss of energy. The game features a total of thirty levels.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "ASF", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147466-pang\n"}
