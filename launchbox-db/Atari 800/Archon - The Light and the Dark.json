{"altername_name": ["Archon"], "name": "Archon: The Light and the Dark", "overview": "The goal of the game is either to take control of five power points located on the board, to eliminate all the opposing pieces, or to eliminate all but one remaining imprisoned piece of the opponent's. While the board is similar to a chessboard, and the various pieces are similarly designed to have various offsetting abilities, when one piece attempts to take another, the removal of the targeted piece is not automatic. Instead, the two pieces are placed into a full-screen 'combat arena' and must battle (action-style, with the players running the pieces) to determine who takes the square.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Free Fall Associates", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.67", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archon:_The_Light_and_the_Dark", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMbOgSY-rJ0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73796-archon-the-light-and-the-dark\n"}
