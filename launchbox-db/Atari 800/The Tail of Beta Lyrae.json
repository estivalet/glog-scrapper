These planetoids have been found to be high in a variety of heavy metals. Due to this, a large number of mining settlements and colonial outposts on these worlds. Now, a nomadic race has invaded these planetoids, determined to have the mining settlements to themselves. The colonists on these worlds live in fear, as the alien invaders will shoot them on sight. As a Galactic Wing Commander assigned to the Beta Quadrant, you are part of a force committed to freeing the colonists from oppression. The player must fly over mountainous terrain, through alien caverns, and over cities. Eventually you must pilot your way into the cavern hosting the power supply of the alien settlements, and destroy the alien power supply. You must then exit the cavern and destroy as much of the fleeing alien forces as possible. Finally the player must navigate a complex asteroid field to reach the next infested planet. This is a side-scrolling shooter. The player can choose from 5 difficulty levels, and can select the number of extra ships they begin with. The player will lose one ship every time they are hit. The player gets points for destroying alien installations, including: plasma cannons, lasers, alien power generators, alien command centers, alien outposts, attack missiles, and more.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Paradise Programming", "publishers": "Datamost, Inc.", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tail_of_Beta_Lyrae", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/j7bqN5KJ364", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/144508-the-tail-of-beta-lyrae\n"}
