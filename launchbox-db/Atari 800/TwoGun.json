{"altername_name": [], "name": "TwoGun", "overview": "A two player game game created by Conrad Tatge and published in A.N.A.L.O.G. Computing Magazine issue 28 in March of 1985. How to play. In TwoGun, shooting your opponent scores a point . .and causes him to fall down dead. Bullets can be obtained by touching the flashing gun that appears at random. This also causes a cactus (in your color) to appear in the gun's position. Bullets are indicated at the top of the screen next to the score. Your cacti slow down your opponent, as well as stop his bullets. Rocks, on the other hand, ricochet bullets at random. They appear when you've shot your opponent's cactus. Watch for the players to change color. Flashing grey means the player cannot move; flashing green means he is low on ammunition. Little gravestones, acting like rocks, will appear after every death \u2014 to the tune of Taps. Home on the Range runs throughout the game. Practice your draw. TwoGun should keep you in top gunfighting shape just in case the villains ride into town.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "March 1, 1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Conrad Tatge", "publishers": "ANALOG Computing", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148947-twogun\n"}
