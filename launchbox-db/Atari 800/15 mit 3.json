{"altername_name": [], "name": "15 mit 3", "overview": "15 mit 3 is a German language dice game for the Atari 8-bit line of computers. It was developed by Funkysoft and published in the April, 1985 issue of Computer Kontakt magazine. The game has up to 25 players. Here you have to form the numbers 1 to 15 by linking 3 numbers rolled with the 4 basic arithmetic operations (plus, minus, times, divided). You must try to form a number that is close to the number on the dice, because the penalty points are awarded. If the time limit has been exceeded or the combination result has a remainder (e.g. 5/4 1.25). When entering the combination, make sure that the computer calculates the terms from left to right. The dot-before-dash rule does not apply.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "April 1, 1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Funkysoft", "publishers": "Computer Kontakt", "genres": "Casino", "max_players": "25", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/167897-15-mit-3\n"}
