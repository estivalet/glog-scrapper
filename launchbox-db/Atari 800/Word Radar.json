{"altername_name": ["Arcademic Skill Builders: Word Radar"], "name": "Word Radar", "overview": "Word Radar is a 1-player word matching game for multiple systems. Eight words are briefly displayed in a circle around the periphery of the screen. These are then covered up, and the line of a radar begins to circle around the screen. The player attempts to find all 8 words before the line completes a whole rotation. Incorrect answers speed up the line. The game tracks correct and incorrect answers over multiple rounds.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Educational Information Systems", "publishers": "DLM (Developmental Learning Materials)", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/150352-word-radar\n"}
