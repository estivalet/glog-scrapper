The rainy weather may affect the brakes' functionality, therefore speed should be adjusted to the conditions on the road. The player can refuel at one of the four gas stations in exchange for a fee. Fuel stations are shown only for two seconds each game. Crashing the bike into a kerb results in the loss of 30 minutes, crashing into a skip results in loss of carrying package.
