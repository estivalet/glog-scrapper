{"altername_name": [], "name": "Rolltris", "overview": "Rolltris was developed for the ABBUC software contest of 2013 and later released as packaged version with its follow-on, Thetris. Rolltris looks like a Tetris game, but plays very differently. In this version you cannot rotate the blocks as they fall, they will land in the configuration they appeared, although the block shapes are as you would expect from regular tetris. After a block shape falls however, you have a set of cursors that can point to a row at the bottom of the screen, and once lined up to that row, you can rotate it left or right. This means you spend all your time manipulating the rows to try to receive the shape that is descending, instead of trying to rotate the blocks to match the rows. Thetris, released later and included in the same box from Powersoft, plays like a traditional Tetris game using the same colorful graphics of Rolltris.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "2013", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "MPG Productions", "publishers": "ABBUC", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151205-rolltris\n"}
