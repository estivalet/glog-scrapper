{"altername_name": [], "name": "3plex", "overview": "A small logical game where you have to place triplets (items of 3-colored tiles) on the board. If you place two or more tiles of same color next to each other, they will disappear. Your task is to play as long as possible until there is no more move (no more empty place for another triplet). Triplets cannot be rotated nor their tiles cannot be swapped, you just have to place them as they appear.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "March 8, 2015", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Martin Simecek (MatoSimi)", "publishers": "", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.07", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8yBJSRNfc8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/107824-3plex\n"}
