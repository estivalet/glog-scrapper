{"altername_name": [], "name": "Helix", "overview": "Helix is a platform game. The player's task is to crawl through a hundred chambers of an old castle to free the enchanted magic necessary to fight with the Great Mage of Night. The most important aspect of the game are the keys. Their number is exactly the same as the number of doors and therefore the player must collect all the keys. While traveling, Helix encounters different enemies and obstacles. Some of them can be neutralized with items that can be found in the rooms.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Pawel Mikolajczak", "publishers": "Mirage Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK1lrVZ1mNE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/108022-helix\n"}
