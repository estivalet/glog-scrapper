{"altername_name": ["Feud: The Graphic Adventure"], "name": "Feud", "overview": "Learic and Leanoric are twins and powerful sorcerers who hated each other. One day, Leanoric cast an aging curse on Learic. As Learic, the player has only one day in which to defeat Leanoric before dying. To achieve your objective, the player must collect many herbs scattered across the map and mix them in a cauldron to make offensive and defensive spells. The spells vary from fireballs and lightning to invisibility and even turning peaceful villagers into zombies. A compass indicates Leanoric's location. Several of the herbs are found in a garden, tended by a gardener. The gardener, though slow-moving, is also able to inflict damage on Learic. Leanoric, as a non-player character, has to do the same thing, collecting herbs to mix in his cauldron before hunting you down in order to attack.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jason C.
