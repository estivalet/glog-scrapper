{"altername_name": [], "name": "Avalanche", "overview": "Avalanche is a game where players have to catch rocks that are falling from six rows that are made up of thirty-two individual rocks each. Rocks fall from the bottom row first, and the rocks decrease in size and increase in falling speed as the rows above it begin to fall. When the game begins with the six rows of rocks, players have six buckets (aligned in a column) in which to catch the rocks. After each row is finished, the player loses one of their buckets. Catching rocks from the bottom row earns the player one point for each rock. Catching rocks from the row above that one earns the player two points per rock, three points per rock for the row above that and so on. If the player misses catching three rocks, the game is over.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1980", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dennis Koble", "publishers": "APX", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.2", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalanche_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/142486-avalanche\n"}
