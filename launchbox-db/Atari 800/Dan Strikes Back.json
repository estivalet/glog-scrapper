{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dan Strikes Back", "overview": "Dan Strikes Back is a 1-player arcade game for the 8-bit Atari. Digger Dan's most prized possession was the Great Diamond, which he unearthed near Round Mount in the Australian outback. His arch enemy Brian the Blob found out where Dan kept the diamond and stole it from him. Brian took the diamond to his deepest vault and locked it away there. The player controls Dan, as he travels steadily deeper into a series of caverns. On each level, Dan must trample the mushrooms and collect the small diamonds to open the passageway to the next deeper level of the vault. The player must avoid the creatures that roam the underground caverns, and all the while Brian the Blob slowly chases after the player. The player can move horizontally and downwards, they can also move vertically while in tight vertical shafts. If the player strikes an enemy, they lose a life. Three lives lost, and it's game over.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Simon Hunt", "publishers": "English Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/XqUN2wIdTN0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/146517-dan-strikes-back\n"}
