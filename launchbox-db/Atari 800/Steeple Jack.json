{"altername_name": [], "name": "Steeple Jack", "overview": "Your objective is to climb up the five ladders shown as far as possible. There are gaps in the ladders that will force you to jump from one to another, also creatures both fall down the ladders and sometimes cross the playing field on a diagonal line, not constrained to a ladder. You can climb up from the bottom of the screen, but this puts you in more danger of not being able to dodge a creature falling down the ladder. Score is awarded for the higher you go.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "P. T.
