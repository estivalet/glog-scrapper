The player has full control over eight energy resources: coal, oil, natural gas, uranium, hydroelectric power, solar power, wind power and biomass. It is possible to promote or restrict each resource, ration them, change their taxes and regulate their prices as well as changing environmental controls. To keep the job, it is necessary to keep people happy and make enough energy available so that the demand is met. Failing to do so leads to the player being fired. A public opinion poll appears every five years and rates the player's accomplishments within three areas: economy growth, inflation and deaths from accidents and pollution. To stay in power its is necessary to get at least a 20% rating in each category and 30% overall.
