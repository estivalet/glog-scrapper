{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cygnus Senese", "overview": "In the galaxy of Cygnus Senese a war is raging. You are a member of the Shield, a select group of mercenaries, hired by one side of this war to help fight their battle. Your organization houses itself in a huge ship which you have maneuvered into the heat of battle. The s'Lex force is the force that has hired Shield to help them, and right now they are busy attacking the Kreeze. You must help the s'Lex force get to the Kreeze, but at the same time keep the Kreeze from attacking the s'Lex. Your ship is equipped with high powered lasers to help you accomplish this. It won't be easy, you know that, but the price was right and you will succeed. You'd better, because if the Kreeze get to the s'Lex, you die. And you sure don't want that to happen. With arcade action and realistic sound.
