{"altername_name": ["Hazard Run"], "name": "Hazard Run: The Ultimate Driving Challenge", "overview": "Hazard Run is a 1-player racing game for the Atari 400/800. Loosely based upon the TV show The Dukes of Hazard, the player controls a large red vehicle as they race through the backwoods avoiding police cars. The vehicle can move horizontally left and right. The car continuously accelerates until the player hits an object, at which point the player loses a vehicle and their speed is reset to zero. If the player runs close to an object, their car will flip onto 2 wheels, and the player must steer down, or the car will flip. The player has limited gas, and must pick up gas tanks to complete longer races. The player must avoid a number of hazards, including: trees, fences, police barricades, rocks, walls, chickens, deer, and lakes. At the end of every level, the player attempts to jump across a river. If they have enough speed, they will clear the canyon, as they watch the police crash into the river behind them. The player starts with 5 vehicles, and when all are lost it's game over. Contains 4 tracks of increasing difficulty: Chicken Run, Walton Wood, Bryan's Pond, and Hell's Canyon.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Artworx", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.33", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_Run", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/zp-wvWYJ-sw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/144502-hazard-run-the-ultimate-driving-challenge\n"}
