{"altername_name": [], "name": "Frogger", "overview": "Frogger is a 1981 arcade game developed by Konami in Japan. The player controls a frog attempting to cross busy roads and rivers with horizontally scrolling vehicles and logs. The frog has to dodge cars, and jump on logs to be carried. The objective is to get enough frogs across the gauntlet to fill up \"frog homes\" on the far side. The Atari 8-bit port was licensed by Sega to both Sierra (for disk media) and Parker Brothers (for cartridges). Numerous unlicensed clones or similar game play style games existed on the Atari, such as \"Preppie\", and \"Pacific Coast Highway\", resulting in the Atari disk boxes carrying a disclaimer \"The Official Frogger\".", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "John Harris", "publishers": "Sierravision", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogger", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/108454-frogger\n"}
