The game takes place in 3216 AD and Earth is about to be destroyed by aliens from the planet Tritan. They have established their base on Mars and the pilot needs to travel there to take out the Time Scalers, devices that allow the aliens to travel to Earth. There are seven scalers to take out and there only two possible landing paths per scaler. The game is a side-scrolling shooter over the surface of the planet Mars. After take-off, the ship needs to bomb radar dishes, time scaler tripods and fuel dumps, while taking out missile space cruisers and auto droids with a regular laser. The ship only has a limited amount of fuel and shields. Fuel is replenished by bombing fuel dumps. The goal is to survive until the time scaler devices have been destroyed, and also to avoid mountains while flying. When fuel is about to run out, it is possible to eject the pilot.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Meteor Software", "publishers": "Byte Back", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/145950-planet-attack\n"}
