{"altername_name": [], "name": "Midway Battles", "overview": "Midway Battles is a strategy wargame for the 8-bit Atari. It is June 4th, 1942. You stand on the bridge of the carrier Enterprise observing your attack planes warming up on the deck, exhaust flames belching in the dawn light of this fateful day. The search planes have been out since early morning, looking for the fleet that was sighted by Midway planes yesterday. You feel terribly outclassed, seeking to engage the undefeated Imperial Japanese navy with your meager forces. The player can participate with human or computer opponent. The Historical Midway Scenario, No Coral Sea Operation, and Random Encounter Scenario are available. The player can choose to add carriers, battleships, or both to either the American or Japanese forces. The player assigns their ships to a number of task forces. Each turn the player and Japanese forces move their ships on an overview screen, and can review the condition of their forces. The player can send out searches from Midway or their task forces, and can attack or send out a combat air patrol if enemy ships are detected.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "TDC Distributors", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/369093-midway-battles\n"}
