{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hot Lips", "overview": "Hot Lips is a maze game action game - you spawn on a mostly grid pattern maze, with a munching mouth in the middle of the playing field. Enemy creatures also spawn and your task is to try to get them to move into the munching mouth while chasing after you. The more time you take to do this, square points will be added to grid passages that slow your player character down but not the enemies, making it more difficult to evade them.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Greg Young", "publishers": "London Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/144692-hot-lips\n"}
