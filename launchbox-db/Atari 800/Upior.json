{"altername_name": [], "name": "Upior", "overview": "The eponymous Upi\u00f3r (Ghoul) has invaded your castle along with his monstrous buddies. Your task is to search the labyrinthine castle for 20 gems, which will allow you to enter the ghoul's chamber and deliver some well-deserved punishment to him. On your way, you'll face numerous monsters, some stationary, some moving. You have to defeat them by punching or kicking. The monsters have variable amounts of resistance to your blows, and variable strength with which they hit you. You've got to battle them carefully; approach them, punch and then move away before they retaliate. If hurt, you can heal yourself by picking up the chalices which can also be found in the castle. Your health, the health of the current enemy and the amount of gems you've collected is displayed at the bottom of the screen. Note that falling from big heights will harm you too. You have only one life - if you run out of health, you instantly die and it's game over.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Rafa\u0142 W\u00f3jcik", "publishers": "L.K.
