{"altername_name": [], "name": "Shooting Arcade", "overview": "Shooting Arcade is a shoot 'em up similar to the arcade game Carnival. Like that game it is based on an amusement park shooting gallery. Targets moving left and right appear in six rows and the aim of the game is simply to shoot them all down before the player runs out of shots. Each target has a different point value and some also have special features. These are the frowning faces which cause an extra rabbit to appear when shot, the bull's eyes which change the direction targets are moving and the diamonds which give extra bullets when hit. Between levels there are extra rounds where a bear runs across the screen. When the player shoots it, it changes direction and runs faster.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mark Riley", "publishers": "Datasoft", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyVJkYgn5dI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/143790-shooting-arcade\n"}
