Construct a pinball game by dropping parts onto the table (or alter the table itself). Alter world physics like gravity, bounce, kick, and speed. Paint custom backboards. Wire together targets for specials and bonus points. Finally, save creations for later, or generate a self-loading version of the table to distribute to friends (original program not needed to play). Comes with 4 pre-made Pinball sets for inspiration and instant gaming fun!", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bill Budge", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinball_Construction_Set", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151054-pinball-construction-set\n"}
