{"altername_name": ["The Earth Dies Screaming"], "name": "Final Orbit", "overview": "You are a space destroyer defending Earth against the Trillians. The Trillians are using attack bases to launch Kamikaze satellites and Trillian fighters at Earth. When a satellite or a fighter gets close, your weapon will automatically track their vertical motion. You must track them horizontally and fire at the right time. You lose energy when a fighter shoots you or when a fighter or satellite explodes on Earth. If you see a fighter with a white stripe (the back of the fighter), keep it on the screen for five seconds and you will come to an attack base. Destroy the attack base to regain energy. If you lose all your energy, you will explode and the Trillians will celebrate as...The Earth Dies Screaming!", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dan Thompson", "publishers": "Sirius Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8qzCMa8iEQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/145114-final-orbit\n"}
