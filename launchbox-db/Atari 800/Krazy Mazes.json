{"altername_name": [], "name": "Krazy Mazes", "overview": "From A.N.A.L.O.G. magazine issue 71 published in April 1989. Krazy Mazes features two different kinds of competitive maze games. In the first screen, you and another player have a maze to navigate, with the first crossing the maze winning. To make it difficult periodically large \"ghost\" creatures will cross the maze; if the ghost is the same color as your player color and touches you, you will be sent back to the beginning. In the second screen there is a larger full screen maze that both players are placed on. As you move through the maze you touch dots which then disappear and give you points; the screen is finished when all dots are consumed. Touching the other player does nothing, so it is a straight forward race to the most points.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "April 3, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Barry Kolbe", "publishers": "ANALOG Computing", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/149184-krazy-mazes\n"}
