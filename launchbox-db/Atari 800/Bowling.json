{"altername_name": ["Bowling I"], "name": "Bowling", "overview": "Bowling is a 1 - 4 player 10-pin bowling game for the 8-bit Atari. Played from the top-down perspective, the ball on the left side of the screen rapidly scrolls vertically, and the player chooses when to release the ball. The goal is to knock down the pins on the right side of the screen. The player can choose to play with no hook, meaning the ball travels straight, with hook, which allows the player to curve the ball, or random release, which causes the ball to be released randomly, forcing the player to hook the shot into the pins. The game keeps track of score through 10 frames.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Program Design, Inc.", "publishers": "Program Design, Inc.", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/144630-bowling\n"}
