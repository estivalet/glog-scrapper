{"altername_name": [], "name": "Firefleet", "overview": "Firefleet is a 1-player side-scrolling arcade game for the 8-bit Atari. The player controls a space cruiser that must descend through four dangerous sectors to reach the bottom. The ship can move in 8 directions, and can fire two lasers vertically downwards. In the first sector, the player must avoid enemy turrets, while the second sector introduces tanks and tighter spaces. Higher sectors combine the enemy weaponry. If the player touches the walls or is struck by enemy fire, they lose a ship. The player starts with 3 ships, and is awarded a new one every 10,000 points.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "English Software Company", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/145003-firefleet\n"}
