{"altername_name": [], "name": "Twerps", "overview": "Twerps is an action game consisting of three screens with different gameplay. Nine twerps have been stranded on an asteroid and in the role of Captain Twerp the player has to rescue them. The first screen is a shoot 'em up where the player starts out on the right and has to shoot a way through four columns of deadly orbiters and fly off the left edge. The orbiters will shoot back and the player has to avoid touching them or their projectiles. The second screen starts out like a simplified Lunar Lander variant where the player has to use thrust to safely land the craft on a pad. After having landed the player moves between craters on the surface in an attempt to save the twerps. Rescued twerps will then follow their captain around. There are two enemies to watch out for on the surface: birds called glingas and drooling mouths called gleepnoks. Glingas catch twerps and drop them back into empty craters while gleepnoks will try to eat the twerps, including the captain. The enemies cannot be destroyed but it is possible to hide from them in craters. After leaving the asteroid there is a second shoot 'em up screen. It works exactly like the first one but this time the player has to move from left to the right. Fuel is depleted during the game and it is necessary to complete all three screens before it runs out.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dan Thompson", "publishers": "Sirius Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twerps_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtO07FCYP6I", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/144291-twerps\n"}
