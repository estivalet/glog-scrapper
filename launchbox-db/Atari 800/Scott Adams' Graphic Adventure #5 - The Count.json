{"altername_name": ["S.A.G.A. No. 05: The Count"], "name": "Scott Adams' Graphic Adventure #5: The Count", "overview": "This is the enhanced version of the original all-text Scott Adams Adventure, The Count. Additions to the original game include illustrations for each location, and support for the VOTRAX voice synthesizer. Otherwise the game remains essentially the same as the original. You awaken in a sealed wing of the Count's Transylvanian castle, seemingly restrictive but yielding further avenues of secret passages and unexpected exits to the intrepid and timely explorer. Over the course of a few days you need to cultivate a familiarity with the layout of the castle and the nocturnal activities of its primary resident, who chooses to make midnight snacks of you rather than a main course. An unpredictable day/night cycle forces your hand, necessitating finding a reliable light source and some means of staying awake -- or else you awaken the next morning back in bed, your possessions pilfered by the kleptomaniacal creature of the night and your neck boasting irritated bite marks. Each day you must incrementally approach your goal of overcoming the Count, lest you wind up as one more dried-out ap\u00e9ritif.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Scott Adams", "publishers": "Adventure International", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Count_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148887-scott-adams-graphic-adventure-5-the-count\n"}
