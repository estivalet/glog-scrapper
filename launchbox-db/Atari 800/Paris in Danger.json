{"altername_name": [], "name": "Paris in Danger", "overview": "Paris in Danger recreates the 1814 campaign against Napoleon's France, when allied Russian, Prussian and Austrian forces of the Sixth Coalition were marching towards Paris. It is played on both strategical (on a map of entire France and today's western Germany; corps size units) and tactical level (battles, which can be also resolved automatically; division size units), from either side of the conflict. Effects of morale, unit facing and formation are taken into account. The players gain victory points (the French for killing enemies, the Allies for capturing cities), which are summed up after 25 turns (each lasting few days) to declare the winner.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Microcomputer Games", "publishers": "The Avalon Hill Game Company", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/146573-paris-in-danger\n"}
