{"altername_name": [], "name": "Soccer", "overview": "Soccer is an simulation of the sport with the same name. In contrast to many other simulations of its time, it keeps all 22 players. There are, however, important differences to the real game: the goalkeeper has no additional functions compared to the field players and there are no half-time or fouls. The game allows up to four players to cooperate on a single team via four attached joysticks, or any combination of splitting players among the two teams. If the player controls the athlete with the ball, he uses the fire button to shoot in the direction the athlete walks to. In the field this can be used to pass to another player. When not in ball possession, pressing the fire button changes the controlled athlete to the one who is most near to the ball (unless he is already controlled by a human player on the same team; then the second-nearest is used). Available options are number of human players, three match times (10, 45 or 90 minutes) and four difficulty levels.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Thorn EMI", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "0.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/143897-soccer\n"}
