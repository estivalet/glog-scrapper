{"altername_name": [], "name": "Creepers", "overview": "Creepers is a 1-player adventure game for the 8-bit Atari. You have arrived on the Island of Gant in an attempt to locate and recover the Golden Chalice of the Kingdom of Corpas. Somewhere within the ancient maze-like Temple of Kavinu lies the Chalice. The player's party consists of the heir to the Corpas throne Prince Jaun VII, wielder of the Silver Sword Sir Denish, the martial artist Squire Cott, the holder of the Teleporting Ring Scholar Dell, the beautiful female archer Gala the Huntress, the great escape artist Dike the Thief, and the fireball casting Wizard Zigg. All characters must move as a group, and each one of these have individual offense and defensive strength. Each character has a special skill, and if that character is lost, the skill is lost as well to the party. For instance the huntress can fire arrows, the thief can safely open chests, and the scholar can use special items. As the player explores the dungeon, they must avoid deathtraps, and engage in combat with Creepers. The goal is to gather four different colored gemstones from the chests within the dungeon, and locate the treasure room, which contains the Chalice. The player must then return successfully to the entry staircase.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Silicon Valley Systems", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148696-creepers\n"}
