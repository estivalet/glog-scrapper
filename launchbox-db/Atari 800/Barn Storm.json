{"altername_name": ["Barnstorm"], "name": "Barn Storm", "overview": "Barn Storm is a side-scrolling 1-player arcade game for the 8-bit Atari computer. The player attempts to fly through a number of barns, while avoiding dangers including fences, other planes, windmills, and animals. The game is timed, and a level is finished once the correct number of barns is reached. The player can accelerate or decelerate and can move up and down to avoid obstacles. If the player strikes an obstacle, they are moved back and are temporarily paused. The goal is to minimize the time required to clear the barns. The game is essentially a clone of the Activision's Atari 2600 game, Barnstorming.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "White Bag Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/166142-barn-storm\n"}
