{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mind Blast", "overview": "The game is a puzzle game in which you re-arrange the board to match the template that is supplied to you on the bottom left of the screen. You do this by moving the stick which moves two columns on the board (vertical and horizontal). You can then push the button and move the stick left or right (which will move the horizontal column in the appropriate direction) or up and down (which will do the same for vertical).", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "2007", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Fandal", "publishers": "Flop", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148935-mind-blast\n"}
