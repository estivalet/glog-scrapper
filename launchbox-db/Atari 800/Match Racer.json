The player must navigate numerous racing challenges, including: bridges, chicanes, barricades, narrow roads, and boulder fields. As the game progresses, the speed of the vehicle increases, making the game more challenging. In 2-player mode, vehicles can collide with each other, and players can work cooperatively, or try to push their opponent off of the road. Dirt, water, and oil slicks can causes vehicles to lose control. If a player hits any solid object, their vehicle is destroyed. In 1-player mode, the player starts with 3 cars. In 2-player mode, each player starts with 5 cars. Points are rewarded for distance traveled, and every 100 points rewards an additional car. When all cars are lost, it's game over.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Solitaire Group", "publishers": "Gebelli Software", "genres": "", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/144285-match-racer\n"}
