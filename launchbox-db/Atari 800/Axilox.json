{"altername_name": [], "name": "Axilox", "overview": "Axilox is a two-player board game. The game board is a picture covered with 81 tiles; each tile has a number on it, dark or fair in color. The players, in turns, remove tiles; the first player removes a tile from the topmost row; the second player can only remove a tile from the same column as the tile just removed; the first player then can only remove the tile from the same row as that tile; and so on. Removing a tile with a fair number increases the player's score by the number, while removing a dark tile decreases the score. The game ends once the entire board is cleared, or when a player cannot make a move. The player with the higher score is the winner. The one-player game involves the human player competing with a computer opponent, trying to keep winning throughout 10 levels with 5 different pictures. The two-player game is a single match.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Piotr Podsiadlo", "publishers": "Mirage Software", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147247-axilox\n"}
