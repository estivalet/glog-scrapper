{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bug Off!", "overview": "In Bug Off!, your garden has fallen into a Florida sinkhole, and the insects within have mutated into beasts of destruction. Armed with only a sprayer can of DDT, you must defend yourself from these rampaging insects. The player controls a chemical sprayer, which can be moved on all four outer edges of the gameplay window. The sprayer will always point towards the center of the screen, where your garden resides. Insects will randomly stream out of the garden, and you must kill them by spraying them with DDT. Every 3 rounds, night will fall, and the army will drop you two new cans of DDT. There are a variety of insects encountered. Moths are harmless, but will try to form cocoons on the edge of the screen, blocking your spraying. Cocoons can be destroyed, but not if they're formed in the corners of the map. Bees attack in force, and prevent your spray from reaching more deadly bugs. There are also insects that will inhabit the corners of the screen, and will destroy the player if they come in contact. At night, butterflies appear, which reward the player bonus points for every corner that has remained free. When the player is hit, they will lose their current can of DDT from their sprayer, and a second can will be thrown to the center of the garden, destroying all bugs on the map. Although the player starts with 6 cans of DDT, they in reality have 3 lives. When all lives are lost, it's game over.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sparky Starks", "publishers": "Adventure International", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/140609-bug-off\n"}
