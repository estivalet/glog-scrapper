{"altername_name": [], "name": "Water Ski School", "overview": "Water Ski School was released initially as a type in machine language program in 1986 by Page 6 magazine; later the author revised it in 2000 and released the updated \"Water Ski School 2\". It's your second week at the Water Ski School, the first week you had no problem skiing but this week its a bit different. The first problem are those ramps that you have to jump, but the worst problem is your boat driver as been taken sick and its up to you, while skiing, to drive the boat as well! You control the boat by moving the stick while holding down the button. By not holding the button you are controlling the skier. The idea of the game is to move down the river with the skier jumping the ramps. The boat will sink if it hits anything. The skier will fall into the water if he hits anything other than the ramp, which he has to hit centrally to jump. Also, if the boat moves while the skier is jumping then he will be pulled over and fall into the water. You get 100 points for every jump, if you jump six ramps by the time you reach the river end then you go to the next level. You are given four lives.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Steve Hind", "publishers": "Page 6", "genres": "Vehicle Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151479-water-ski-school\n"}
