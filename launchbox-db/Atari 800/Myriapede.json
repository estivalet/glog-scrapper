{"altername_name": [], "name": "Myriapede", "overview": "Myriapede is notable mostly for its history - the game itself is a straight Centipede clone, although it plays well. The author Landon Dyer wrote this version while in college, sent it to Atari, and because it was a straight clone of a game they also made, they declined to publish it but did hire him, and he went on to make other Atari games - notably Donkey Kong. Reportedly the author of the official Centipede Atari version told Landon this one is a better game.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Landon Dyer", "publishers": "", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/150966-myriapede\n"}
