{"altername_name": [], "name": "Midi Maze", "overview": "Midi Maze is an astounding piece of technology for the 8-bit - a first person shooter, with smooth graphics updates in 3D (with sprite opponents) featuring up to 16 players in multiplayer, with real time chat. It can also be played solo with AI opponents. This unreleased prototype is a port of the same game from the Atari ST. Since the Atari 8 bits did not have a default MIDI device, a variety of connection options were provided through SIO devices (a MIDI device, modems, and the Atari 850 interface). Gameplay involves moving about a maze with your opponents, all represented by happy face characters. You have a view of the maze before you enter from the top, but in gameplay it is first person, with a status window to the left, kill counts to the right, and chat below. You can shoot in a straight line on the direction you are facing, so you have to turn your character to line up shots.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "George Miller", "publishers": "Atari", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "16", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI_Maze", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/150740-midi-maze\n"}
