{"altername_name": [], "name": "601F", "overview": "601F is a 3D golf simulation. The player controls a pointer via joystick which determines the direction and force of a hit on the ball, then the ball rolls across the 3-D terrain with basic physics simulation. A typical terrain is several screens wide, and the display will scroll when the ball reaches the edge of the existing screen. The objective just as in real golf is to get the ball into the hole on the field. There is an editor supplied as well to create your own terrains.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "2019", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kamil Trzaska", "publishers": "ABBUC", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/160351-601f\n"}
