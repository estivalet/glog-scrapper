{"altername_name": [], "name": "Peanut Butter Panic", "overview": "Peanut Butter Panic is a game for two players where your goal is to create peanut butter sandwiches! To do this, you need to jump up and grab stars from the top of the screen which can be used to power the sandwich machine. Some stars are too high to reach by just jumping; on either side of the screen is a spring board which can be used to launch your partner higher. After making sandwiches, you can then eat them to replenish your energy supply. Eating sandwiches also makes your character heavier which allows you to launch your partner even higher when jumping on the spring board. On some levels you need to watch out for Snarfs which will eat your sandwiches! The game ends when you run out of energy.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "CTW Software Group", "publishers": "CBS Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/eNaw3v5iTwE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/146574-peanut-butter-panic\n"}
