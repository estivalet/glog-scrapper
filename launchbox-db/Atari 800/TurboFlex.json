{"altername_name": ["Turboflex"], "name": "TurboFlex", "overview": "TurboFlex continues the Deflex formula by Jeff Minter. The objective is to hit a target with a ball within a set amount of time, To do so the player places deflectors or bats in the location the ball is at the time of placement and the ball immediately changes direction. The ball moves across the screen in either a horizontal or vertical direction, the player places one of two type of barriers in the location the ball is at any given moment and it immediately changes direction from horizontal to vertical (or vice versa). The type of barrier placed determines if he bounces up/down or left/right. Once the ball hits a barrier, it changes direction, so the next time the ball hits it, it will send the ball in the opposite direction. There are five different modes of play, static targets and four types of moving targets (a mixture of fast/slow and with reverse). The difficulty increases with each phases of play, up to level 5.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jeff Minter", "publishers": "LLamasoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/155456-turboflex\n"}
