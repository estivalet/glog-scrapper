The game shows a password covered by series of blank spaces. The player's task is to guess the password in a certain number of attempts. Each correct answer gives a point, each wrong answer draws a part of a hanged man. After reaching a certain amount of mistakes the player becomes a hangman and the game ends. In two player mode contestants alternately guess the same password, knowing the letters given by the opponent. Each of them has its own gallows.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "ASF", "genres": "", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/370176-stryczek\n"}
