{"altername_name": ["Adventure at Vandenberg AFB"], "name": "Adventure at Vandenberg A.F.B.", "overview": "Adventure at Vandenberg A.F.B. is a text adventure written by Tom Hudson and published in issue 27 of ANALOG Computing dated February 1985. You're a nosy reporter for the Daily Babble, a large metropolitan gossip tabloid, following a hot story. You've overheard several terrorists discussing a diabolical plot: the destruction of the Air Force's newest space shuttle seconds before launch! The bomb has already been placed somewhere on the base, its timer set to detonate at 09:00. Shocked, you rush to the local police station, to warn them to stop the launch. Unfortunately, they've read your stories about Bigfoot actually being a UFO alien, and they won't believe the shuttle story, either. Now it's up to you alone to save the shuttle and its five crew members. Using all your reporter's cunning, you manage to sneak past the gate guards. You duck into a small storage shed, knowing that the hardest part of your job is still ahead of you. And you've only got one hour.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tom Hudson", "publishers": "ANALOG Computing", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148606-adventure-at-vandenberg-afb\n"}
