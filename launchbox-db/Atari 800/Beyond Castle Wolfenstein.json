The player must retrieve a bomb that the operatives have placed inside the bunker and place it outside the door of the room where Hitler is holding his meeting, a scenario bearing a passing resemblance to the July 20 Plot.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Muse Software", "publishers": "Muse Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyond_Castle_Wolfenstein", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzSIcJnjgV4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73940-beyond-castle-wolfenstein\n"}
