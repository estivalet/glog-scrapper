{"altername_name": ["Kayos"], "name": "Kayos: Space War Game", "overview": "Kayos is a 1-player space-themed arcade shooter for the Atari 400/800. Time has ceased to exist since Kayos took over. The world is unknown, and all records were lost when asteroids eradicated all life on the planet's surface. The world's computer has established a network of underground base stations to ward off the Kayotians. You play as one of these bases to defend from the attacking Kayotians. The player controls a small spaceship which can move horizontally on the screen, and fire vertically forwards. There are 3 difficulty levels: beginning, intermediate, and normal. A series of motherships streak across the top of the screen, deploying attack ships to harass the player. After a mothership is destroyed, a bomb will be launched towards the player. A small invulnerable \"Anti-War Distractor\" continuous scrolls from the right of the screen to block the player's shots. The player starts with 5 ships, and has the ability to gain a new ship every 10,000 points. If all ships are lost, it's game over.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Computer Magic", "publishers": "Computer Magic", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147970-kayos-space-war-game\n"}
