{"altername_name": [], "name": "Joust", "overview": "Joust is an arcade game developed by Williams Electronics and released in 1982. While not the first game to feature two-player cooperative play, Joust was more successful than its predecessors and popularized the concept. The player uses a button and joystick to control a knight riding a flying ostrich. The object is to progress through levels by defeating groups of enemy knights riding buzzards. Joust was ported to the Nintendo Entertainment System and to several Atari platforms: the Atari 2600, Atari 5200, Atari 7800, and Atari Lynx consoles, as well as Atari 8-bit and Atari ST home computers.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atari", "publishers": "Atari", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.58", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joust_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2q2X1XIQsg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73677-joust\n"}
