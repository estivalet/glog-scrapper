{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sinistar", "overview": "An unreleased prototype of the arcade classic for the Atari 8-bits developed by Atari and was set to be released in late 1984 or early 1985. However, for some reason the game got cancelled despite being finished. The game did get an unofficial release in 2010 via AtariAge, however. Game description: Originating in the arcades, Sinistar is a multi-directional shooter. In the game, you must fly your ship about, shooting the floating asteroids to release Sinisite crystals. These crystals must be gathered to create Sinibombs. Also gathering crystals are worker drones. They are gathering crystals to build Sinistar, who wants to destroy the universe. As the workers will sometimes steal your mined crystals, feel free to blast them. Also flying about are warrior ships who want to blast you to protect the workers and Sinistar. Once Sinistar is completed, he will announce, \"Beware! I live!\" and begin chasing you. Hopefully, you have made enough Sinibombs to destroy him. As he chases you, press the fire button to release Sinibombs to damage him. Once he is completely destroyed, you are off to the next, harder, level.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atari", "publishers": "AtariAge", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/370440-sinistar\n"}
