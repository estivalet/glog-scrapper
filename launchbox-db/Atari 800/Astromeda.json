{"altername_name": [], "name": "Astromeda", "overview": "In this game heavily inspired by the C64 classic Uridium, your objective is to pick up your fellow astronauts drifting in space, reach the alien mothership and destroy it. In order to destroy the mothership, you must destroy the aliens, and avoid the deadly meteorites. The main difference between this and Uridium, is that you cannot turn your ship around and go right-to-left like you can in the game that inspired this, you can only fly left-to-right.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Anthony J.
