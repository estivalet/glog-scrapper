{"altername_name": [], "name": "Go", "overview": "Go is a computer implementation of the classic board game. Played on a 19 x 19 grid, it allows for 2-player competitive or 1-player versus computer play. Players take turns placing either a black or a white marker on the screen, with the goal to capture the opponent's piece by surrounding it in the 4 cardinal directions. The winner is the player with the most captured pieces after the board is filled. The player can set a computer handicap which allows them to start with 0 - 9 friendly pieces on the board.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Hayden Software", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/167646-go\n"}
