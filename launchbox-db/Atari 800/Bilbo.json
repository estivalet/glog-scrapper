{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bilbo", "overview": "Bilbo is a close variant of Lady Bug (which itself is a Pac-Man variant). The player character, a garden gnome, finds itself in single-screen mazes and needs to collect all points by moving over them. Unfortunately there are also ghosts wandering around which try to touch the gnome - with deadly results. The main difference to Pac-Man are flap doors which change their orientation when passed. The ghosts can't use them. An additional obstacle are stationary skulls which, just as the ghosts, mean instant death when touched. There are also bigger points which, if collected in the correct order, spell EXTRA and give a big score boost.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "AMC-Verlag", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KBUVh1RCVI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/145293-bilbo\n"}
