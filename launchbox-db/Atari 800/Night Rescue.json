The player must navigate through a lengthy journey through a city without crashing into any of the buildings or ground, avoid obstacles, and rescue as many humans as possible. The enemy consists of tanks, rockets, helicopters, and a manic warplane. You must maneuver through a city-scape and reach your ultimate destination where you rescue the last hostages. Each rescued hostage gives you 100 points.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Eric Anschuetz", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/150974-night-rescue\n"}
