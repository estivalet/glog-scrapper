{"altername_name": [], "name": "Caveman", "overview": "Caveman is a platform game set in the prehistoric times, similar to Prehistorik. As a caveman, on each level the player has to find food for his family. The main protagonist wanders around the wilderness and explores caves in his search. Hostile animals and plants have to be avoided - contact with them drains health. There are also dangerous environment elements such as bonfires or deep water. There is a time limit on each level, and a specific amount of food to be collected before the level can be completed.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Taurus Software", "publishers": "Mirage Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147651-caveman\n"}
