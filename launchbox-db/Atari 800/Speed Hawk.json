{"altername_name": [], "name": "Speed Hawk", "overview": "One hundred years ago your ancestors defeated a powerful force of space pirates to secure a new beginning for the humans who are inhabiting the planet Tintagel 4. Now, a century later, space pirates want to attack the ring worlds surrounding Tintagel 4. As a direct descendant of the legendary hero \"Speedhawk\", it is your task to stop them by infiltrating their motherships and destroy the mutant guardians (which serve as bosses) at the end of each level. Hostile space fighters and turrets will try to protect their motherships, but if you manage to destroy a space fighter it might give you a power-up. But be warned as they can also be shot and will be destroyed. They also might fly away if you don't collect them in time.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Atari (UK)", "genres": "", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/145658-speed-hawk\n"}
