{"altername_name": ["Desmonds Dungeon"], "name": "Desmond's Dungeon", "overview": "The game is in two parts; in the first part you (Desmond) are running about a dungeon recovering bags of gold dropped by the fiendish Alfonso, who will also fly by sometimes and try to bomb you if he sees you stealing his gold. There are various hazards and creatures to avoid, and to complicate things, when you are carrying a bag of gold to take them to the surface you cannot jump. In the second part you are in the Vault, and the objective is to throw bags up in the air (via the fire button) to be caught by passing \"grabs\". You must avoid bombs, eggs, spiders and fireballs to get enough gold to progress to the next level.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Creative Sparks", "publishers": "Alternative Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hh_nyOe3ZcY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/150037-desmonds-dungeon\n"}
