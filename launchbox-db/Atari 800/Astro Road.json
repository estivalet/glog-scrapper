{"altername_name": [], "name": "Astro Road", "overview": "Astro Road gameplay is simple but frantic. You have a spaceship that must maneuver from an approaching asteroid field (scrolling down the screen). Touching any of the asteroids kills you; luckily you have a shield to avoid death, but it has a limited charge and drains quickly when used. The objective is to get as far as you can in the field.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "2004", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Frantisek Houra", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/mArr8qaqIHo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/149698-astro-road\n"}
