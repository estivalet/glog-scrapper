{"altername_name": [], "name": "Schreckenstein", "overview": "Rarely seen at release as it was only published in German, Shreckenstein is a two player (cooperative or competition) platform jump/scroller. The screen is split into two horizontal sections, one for each player, even in a single player game (second player is an AI with one human player). Like many platform scrollers, players must avoid various creatures and obstacles, jump over gaps, and navigate up and down and side to side through a maze. Playfields are quite dense and colorful, with plenty of animated sprites. What set Schreckenstein aside was its always-on two player approach and the high speed scrolling of the two playfields. Best enjoyed with two players.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Peter Finzel", "publishers": "Ariola", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lg-MlAz9mYU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/116682-schreckenstein\n"}
