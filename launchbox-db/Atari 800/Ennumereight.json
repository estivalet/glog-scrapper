{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ennumereight", "overview": "Ennumereight is a 1 - 2 player board game for the 8-bit Atari computer. Two players, or a computer opponent, play on a figure-8 board containing 8 separate spaces. Players take turns choosing one of the 4 spaces on their side of the game board. The numbers of that space are then counted around the board, with one point going to each location until all pieces. If the player plays so that the last space becomes a 2 or a 3 on their opponent's side of the board, they gain those points. The points are removed from the board, and gameplay continues until all points are removed from the board. There are 7 levels of computer opponent difficulty, and the player can start with 4 - 8 points in each space on the circle. The player with the most points at the end of the game is the winner.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Philip J.
