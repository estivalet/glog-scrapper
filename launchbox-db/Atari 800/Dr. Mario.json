{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dr. Mario", "overview": "Dr. Mario is an unofficial port/clone of the Nintendo classic puzzle game of the same name for the Atari 8-bit family of computers. This port was developed by Pawel Gugala and released into the public domain in 2010. Game description: In this Tetris-style game, you play as Dr. Mario, who must drop differently coloured pills onto viruses to remove them from the bottle. Each pill is split into two, with each side being of one of three different colours, red, blue or yellow. Align three pills of the same colour to a virus of the corresponding colour (or any combination of pills and viruses totaling four or more) and it will be removed from the bottle, along with the aligned pills. The level is cleared when there are no viruses left, and the game is over when the pills reach the top and Dr. Mario can't drop any more pills.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "2010", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Pawel Gugala", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OQxpYNDUZ4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/156629-dr-mario\n"}
