{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sharp Shooter", "overview": "Published in issue 76 of A.N.A.L.O.G. Computing Magazine dated September 1989, this light gun shooter from Matthew J. W. Ratcliff is a challenging target-practice game, it requires quick reflexes and a good eye, and will improve your shooting skills for Bug Hunt, Barnyard Blaster, Cross Bow and other Atari shoot- 'em-ups. Sharp Shooter is best when played with several friends for some neighborly competition. The game screen is presented in the form of six pistol targets, three across the top and three across the bottom. Each is made up five concentric circles, the center, of course, being the bull's-eye. Sharp Shooter selects a target at random and draws a rectangle around it. Take aim and squeeze off a shot. If the bull's-eye is hit, a pleasant \"ding\" sound will be heard. A complete miss of the target results in a dull thud. A hit anywhere else on the target is acknowledged by a brief \"splat\" sound, and the game continues. Each target is selected ten times throughout the game, for a total of 60 shots per game. Since each target can be randomly selected at any time, you cannot anticipate where to aim next. This hones reflexes and hand/eye coordination. At the end of a game, firing statistics are tallied and displayed. At the top of the screen, the average bullets-fired-per-minute statistic is presented. A good shooter will average about 40 to 45.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "September 1, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Matthew J. W.
