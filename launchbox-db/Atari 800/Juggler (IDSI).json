{"altername_name": [], "name": "Juggler (IDSI)", "overview": "Juggler is a 1-player arcade game. The player controls a small juggler, whom moves left to right on the bottom of the screen. The goal is to keep 6 separate balls or pins aloft at the air, by pushing them continuously upwards from a stream coming from the juggler's hands. There are 7 difficulty levels, where the player has progressively smaller field of juggling, making it more difficult to keep balls or pins aloft. On each difficulty level, the player must keep the balls aloft for 90 seconds, at which point they will progress to a more difficult level. The player gains points by the number of bounces the balls make. If the balls fall to the ground, they player loses a life. Lose 3 lives, and it's game over.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "IDSI", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/144685-juggler-idsi\n"}
