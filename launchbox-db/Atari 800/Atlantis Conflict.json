{"altername_name": ["Atlantis Revenge"], "name": "Atlantis Conflict", "overview": "Deep in sparkling blue-green waters sleeps the wonderful city of Atlantis. Suddenly, without warning, strange and devilish forces attack! Guide your sub with the joystick and with the firebutton send speeding torpedos to demolish the enemy. If four mines hit the protective shield, the lovely aquatic city is destroyed. Remember, your sub runs on limited fuel, so refuel at a dock under Atlantis. If you run out of fuel you will sink to destruction. Fast pace and nimble action are essential for survival.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "General Masters Corporation", "publishers": "K-Tek Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0DlOLsGpmo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148233-atlantis-conflict\n"}
