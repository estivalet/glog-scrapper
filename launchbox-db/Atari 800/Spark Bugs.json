{"altername_name": [], "name": "Spark Bugs", "overview": "The player controls an electric cobra, who must reconnect the world's energy grid. The cobra moves horizontally on a series of platforms, and can drag energy conduits horizontally. The goal is to connect all of the conduits, so that they bring energy to the surface, activating the electrical field, and zapping the moth that flies across the top of the screen. To defend itself, the cobra can shoot electric bolts, which damage some creatures, but can also jump out of the way to avoid other monsters as they pass. The large moth at the top of the screen drops battery beetles, which will disconnect conduits by hauling them off to the side of the screen. The cobra can move up or down to any level that has been connected to conduits, but to travel higher, or to go lower if the beetles remove conduits, must use the elevators at the sides of the screen. The player starts with 3 lives, and it's game over if all are lost. The player loses a life if they are hit by an enemy or if the timer runs out.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Romox", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/144276-spark-bugs\n"}
