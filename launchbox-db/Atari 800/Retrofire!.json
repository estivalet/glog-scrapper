{"altername_name": [], "name": "Retrofire!", "overview": "Retrofire! is a Lunar Lander style game with many enhancements but the same basic premise. You are landing your ship on the surface of the moon Io, you start from high altitude and see a 3-D perspective grid of the world below. There is a particular sector of the grid indicated to land on by a flashing red X. As you get closer to the surface, the grid zooms in and becomes actual topology of the world, with hills and low areas. To make matters more interesting you need to get out of the upper atmosphere quickly or you will be exposed to radiation (there is a meter to the right of the screen). Further, sometimes when you get close to the surface you will encounter volcanoes you must avoid. Gravity can set to Low/Medium/High with the Option key. Fuel amount can be set with the select key. The \"C\" key will change the artifacting colors displayed.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tom Hudson", "publishers": "ANALOG Computing", "genres": "Vehicle Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148589-retrofire\n"}
