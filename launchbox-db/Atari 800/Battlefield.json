{"altername_name": [], "name": "Battlefield", "overview": "Battlefield is a 2-player war game for multiple systems. Played on an 8 x 10 board, each player starts with control of the 40 squares on their side of the field. Each turn, the player is granted a number of new forces in the rear position as well as movement points, which can be used to move troops towards enemy positions. The number of movement points and new troops granted are based upon the number of squares currently held. When units are moved onto an enemy square, the side with the most troops in that position wins the square. The first player to own all squares is the winner.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jon Voskuil", "publishers": "SoftSide Publications", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/150400-battlefield\n"}
