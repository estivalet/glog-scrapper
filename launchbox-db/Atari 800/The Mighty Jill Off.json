{"altername_name": ["Might Jill Off"], "name": "The Mighty Jill Off", "overview": "The Might Jill Off (MJO) is an adaption of the game by the same name for Windows/Mac from 2008. It stars a submissive named Jill, who has a boot fetish and is forced to climb up a tower after her Queen kicks her down it as punishment. Jill does this by jumping and slowly descending over obstacles. Jill can be defeated in one hit by these obstacles, but will return to the last check point. The game serves as an homage to the 1984 arcade game Bomb Jack and its console and computer sequel, Mighty Bomb Jack. The measure of success in the game is time taken to complete it; lower times are better, and there is no life count.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "2011", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Daniel Pralle", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mighty_Jill_Off", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/150742-the-mighty-jill-off\n"}
