{"altername_name": [], "name": "Air Hockey", "overview": "From A.N.A.L.O.G. magazine January 1986. Once your options are set (or left alone, if you like the default settings) you may press START to play. You'll then see a vertical air hockey board with the scores displayed at the top, along with the score necessary to win the game. The puck will appear in front of the serving player's paddle. That player must hit the puck to start the game. The game is something like Pong, with forward motion as well as side-to-side. Players control the paddles by moving the joystick in the direction they wish to move. The buttons do nothing. A score is made when the puck goes into the yellow goal area of a player, and the other player becomes the server. If the puck gets stuck between players, as it can in real air hockey, you may re-serve by pressing the SPACE BAR. Also, while in the play mode, you may press the ESCape key to exit the program. Finally, if you want to restart the game, press START anytime during the game (except during the goal sequence), and you'll be returned to the options screen. When the game is over, there's a long cheering sequence with whistling fans (if the crowd likes you) before you're returned to the title screen.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Chris Page", "publishers": "ANALOG Computing", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161023-air-hockey\n"}
