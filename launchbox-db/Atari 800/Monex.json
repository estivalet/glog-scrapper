{"altername_name": [], "name": "Monex", "overview": "Your task is eliminate colored tiles by collecting them using a mover cursor. Every tile has own value(number). The mover can hold as many tiles as you want, but they have to be same value/color. When you collect a given amount of same tiles, they disappear and create new tiles with a higher number. You have to collect at least five tiles with number 1 to create tile with number 5, then at least two tiles with number 5 to create tile with number 10 and so on... There are six tiles with numbers 1,5,10,50,100,500. When you collect at least two tiles with the number 500, they disappear without creating a new tile. There is also one special tile called \"shit tile\" which comes after several minutes of play. You have to collect at least five of them to make them vanish. These tiles come quite rarely, so they will just stay in the way to score. New tiles come from the bottom of playfield and push old tiles up. The game ends when there is no place for new tiles. Game speed is increased over time.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "2005", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Martin Sime\u010dek", "publishers": "ABBUC", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/150774-monex\n"}
