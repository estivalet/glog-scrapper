{"altername_name": ["Java Jim"], "name": "Java Jim...in Square Shaped Trouble", "overview": "The game involves you playing as Jim on a board with a volcano in the middle. The volcano constantly erupts, sending balls of fire in Jims direction, which are deadly if they touch him. Jim can bounce from square to square on the board by using the joystick movement; if the player pauses and releases the joystick when on a square, Jim will dig and something will be revealed. The objective is to find the same item indicated in the \"target\" upper left corner of the screen; after repeating this enough times, the Volcano will turn into a set of stairs and the player can move to another board.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kevin Buckner", "publishers": "Creative Sparks", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/150539-java-jimin-square-shaped-trouble\n"}
