But, the computer at Robatahelp Inc. has gone berserk, and is programming every robot on the assembly line to roll out the factory and straight into your house. Their orders, clean up everything, including you. The player moves in all directions, and can fire in the cardinal directions. Robots rapidly appear from the edges of the screen and move towards the player. A laser beam moves slowly across the screen, decreasing the play area.

The player must destroy 30 robots and escape out the front door before the game is lost.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "General Masters Corporation", "publishers": "K-Tek Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148238-exit-watch\n"}
