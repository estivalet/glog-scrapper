{"altername_name": ["Bomb Jack"], "name": "Bomb Jake", "overview": "Bomb Jake is a clone of Bomb Jack which was is a platform game that was originally released in arcade form and subsequently ported to many different systems. The Atari 8-bit did not receive a port during the initial popularity of the game; that was addressed later with a disk version that requires extra memory (due to the many colorful backgrounds), but also a cartridge that would work on any 64K Atari. The port is well regarded both for its authenticity to the original and solid game play. The cartridge version was sold under the name \"Bomb Jake\", possibly to avoid legal issues as a sold product.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "2008", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Krzysztof Gora", "publishers": "GR8 Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomb_Jack", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_DYedXU6Ag", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/149738-bomb-jake\n"}
