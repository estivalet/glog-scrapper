{"altername_name": ["Bean Machine"], "name": "The Bean Machine", "overview": "The Bean Machine is a 1-player arcade game for the 8-bit Atari Computer. The bean machine continually picks up beans from a tray on the bottom of the screen, and randomly drops beans at points throughout a maze of moving platforms, monsters, and doors. The player controls 5 platforms with pivot points in the center of the screen, and can rotate the platforms clockwise or counterclockwise. Beans will run along the platforms, and as beans move through the maze, their weight will move the platforms. If beans strike each other, one is destroyed and returns to the starting tray. The goal is to navigate all beans to the collecting tray towards the bottom. There are 3 levels of difficulty, and the goal is to guide all beans in the minimal amount of time.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Steve Robinson", "publishers": "APX", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfdBSTISbt8&t=22s", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/145095-the-bean-machine\n"}
