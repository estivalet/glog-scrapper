{"altername_name": ["American Road Race"], "name": "The Great American Cross-Country Road Race", "overview": "The game puts the player in the position of a driver of a high-performance car, racing across the United States while passing through its major cities. Obstacles include weather, road conditions, limited fuel, and the highway patrol. The changing time of day affects gameplay, because the other cars drive faster at night. Players are given the option of choosing their routes from city to city, allowing them to, for example, take a northern route through the snowy Midwest. Every route has its own scoreboard for the top ten fastest times to complete each route.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Alex Demeo", "publishers": "Activision (UK)", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.43", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_American_Cross-Country_Road_Race", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_UgERxwAuk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/108024-the-great-american-cross-country-road-race\n"}
