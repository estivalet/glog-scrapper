{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bonk", "overview": "Collect diamonds, while avoiding robots. Green walls can be opened by simply walking through them and blue walls will kill you by touching them. Items with the letter \"F\" can stop the guardians for a short while. Bonk, a fast-moving arcade game for one player. You control a small, green creature with joystick 1. Your object is to collect all of the flashing diamonds scattered around the board before time runs out. When you hit a diamond, a \"ding\" will be heard. You're probably thinking, \"What a stupid game! It sounds easy.\" Well, of course your green creature is not free to roam wherever it pleases. You're being chased by three electric whirlers that kill on contact. They don't sound friendly. . .and they aren't. They will chase you wherever they can, trying to send you to that big arcade in the sky. But, luckily, they aren't extremely intelligent (in other words, their IQ is the same as their shoe size). When you're being chased, just put a wall between yourself and your relentless pursuers, and Bonk! \u2014 they'll slam into the wall and be thrown backwards. After a while, they'll regain their senses, and you'll be in trouble again. If you plan your strategy correct- ly, you can get the whirlers trapped in corners. Bonking around. Just don't trap them near a jewel that you still need. Later in the game, the whirlers will re- cover from a Bonk sooner, and you'll have to use your other defenses.
