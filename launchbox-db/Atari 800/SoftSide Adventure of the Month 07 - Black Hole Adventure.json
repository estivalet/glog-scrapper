{"altername_name": ["Black Hole Adventure"], "name": "SoftSide Adventure of the Month 07: Black Hole Adventure", "overview": "This is a standard text-parser adventure game similar to others in the genre at the time, with an action/noun two word parser. The game is closely modeled from the movie \"The Black Hole\" (1979), however it is not an official license. Several characters seen in the movie appear, and the general setting is the same. The game has approximately 30 locations, so is mid-sized for adventures of the time. The crew of an interstellar craft discovers the long-lost Deep-Space Probe One, the Cygnus, at the edge of the vortex surrounding an immense black hole. See if you can foil the plans of Dr. Hans Reinhardt. Part of a continuing series of adventures published by the magazine Softside (but also available directly ordered without the magazine).", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "December 1, 1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Peter Kirsch", "publishers": "SoftSide Publications", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165200-softside-adventure-of-the-month-07-black-hole-adventure\n"}
