{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Electroids", "overview": "A single-screen platform game by James Hague and published in A.N.A.L.O.G. Computing Magazine issue 43 in June 1984. For years, I've been seeing *\u2022 clone; after clone of climbing and shooting arcade-style games that show very little originality. After learning assembly language. I believed 1 could do better. Not realizing the enormity of the task before me, I set out to accomplish what only wizards like Tom Hudson could ever achieve. After months of errors, bad sectors and everything else my Atari could throw at me my perseverance has been rewarded. The going was rough, but I'm proud to finally present Electroids \u2014 an original, 100% machine language arcade game for one player. Electroids is a joystick-controlled game for one player. You must protect special \"power jewels\" from a group of attackers known as Electroids. These creatures fall from the top of the screen, attempting to come in contact with one of the pulsating green jewels at the bottom. If an Electroid hits one of the many floating yellow platforms, it will move along the surface until it can again continue down. If it does manage to touch one of the power jewels, a short circuit will occur \u2014 and you'll lose five units of energy. On the brighter side, the Electroid which did the damage will be eliminated. You begin the game with fifty units of energy; it's over when all are lost. You control a small green creature which defies biological classification. It's known as simply the \"Green Thing.\" Its job is to prevent Electroids from short-circuiting those power jewels located in the lower portion of the screen. The Green Thing is moved left and right along the yellow platforms by pushing the joystick in that direction. If it moves off one side of the screen, it will re-appear on the other, and vice versa. If the Green Thing moves off one of the platforms, it will fall, but no harm will come to it (in fact, that's the only way to move down). In order to move upward, press and hold the trigger. The Green Thing will jump until the trigger's release, then it will fall until it hits a platform. It's important to note that Green Things can be moved left and right while falling and jumping. The Green Thing is quite a versatile little creature, isn't it? Now on to the important part. In order to stop an Electroid, you must touch it while it's green \u2014 when it's falling. This will cause the Electroid to bounce backwards toward the top of the screen until it hits a ledge, when it will again begin the suicidal descent. This trick will give you anywhere from 5 to 75 points, depending on the level. If you touch an Electroid while he is red (on platforms) , energy will be quickly drained from your supply. When I say \"quickly,\" I mean quickly, so watch out! The only part of the game that seems to confuse beginners is how to complete a level. A level is complete when a certain number of Electroids have been eliminated. They can be eliminated in any of three ways: (1) when bounced off the top of the screen, (2) when exiting from the screen through the lower left- or righthand corners of the screen, or (3) when hitting a jewel. Destroy enough and it will advance to the next level.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "June 1, 1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "James Hague", "publishers": "ANALOG Computing", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148600-the-electroids\n"}
