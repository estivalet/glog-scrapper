{"altername_name": [], "name": "Miecze Valdgira", "overview": "Miecze Valdgira (Valdgir's Swords) is an action/adventure game, starring the gnome Aldir, who must find the five eponymous swords in order to free the castle Heldgor from a curse. Aldir must wander a labyrinthine dungeon, collecting one-use items along the way and using them in the right places, for example to open passages or give them to people for new items. Most dungeon rooms have a swarm of tiny hostile creatures flying around in them. Aldir can shoot fireballs to kill the creatures one by one. Contact with the creatures drains health; when all health is depleted, Aldir loses a life. Every killed creature gives 100 points, and Aldir gets a new life every 10000 points. The player can switch between music and sound effects.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "ASF", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/146634-miecze-valdgira\n"}
