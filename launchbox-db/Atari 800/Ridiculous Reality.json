{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ridiculous Reality", "overview": "At first glance Ridiculous Reality looks like a standard platformer; the character can jump from section to section, there are keys and enemies to avoid, etc. However pressing the joystick reveals the puzzle nature of the game; the screen the player is on shrinks, and is shown as one piece in a set on a greater map. Keeping the mouse button down and moving the stick moves entire screens to be adjacent to each other, or on opposite sides from where they start (but only the screen the player currently occupies, you must move to other screens to be able to move them). This is the puzzle - the player needs to arrange the world so there is a path to traverse to the exit, then play that arranged set like a platformer.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "2012", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Martin Sime\u010dek", "publishers": "ABBUC", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151153-ridiculous-reality\n"}
