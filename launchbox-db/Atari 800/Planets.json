{"altername_name": [], "name": "Planets", "overview": "Planets is a simple two-player game created for the \"NOMAM Basic Ten-Liners 2014\" competition. The entire code, written in the Turbo Basic XL language, is 10 lines long. There are two planets on the screen, with a random size and position. Each player uses a joystick to control a cannon on the surface of his planet. The cannon can be moved along the surface of the planet, and a missile can be launched with the \"fire\" key. Missiles are affected by gravitational pull as they fly. A missile digs a hole in the planet when it strikes. The cannons cannot be moved over a hole in the planet's surface. A player wins if he destroys his opponent's planet by managing to fire a missile into its center. The game has no title screen, it starts with the gameplay immediately.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "February 16, 2014", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bill Kendrick", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/168404-planets\n"}
