{"altername_name": [], "name": "House of Usher (Crystalware)", "overview": "Walk the dreaded corridors of the deadly House of Usher. Complete with 40 rooms and hundreds of aggressive monsters and unique treasures. This is not your typical text adventure game but goes far beyond that, with animated monsters and a visual display of each room. We believe this to be the first indoor-outdoor game ever written for a microcomputer game which includes graphics. You may choose to wander through Usher's scenic garden paths or brave the perils of the graveyard and descend into the crypt. Beneath the house there are labyrinths, shrinking rooms, and torture chambers with no doors or windows. Your character may pick up, drop, or use objects, fire arrows, or run frantically for the door when pursued by some loathsome creature. As the old grandfather clock ticks away, you will have until dawn to solve the Usher Mystery and win a real live $100 prize!", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1980", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "John A.
