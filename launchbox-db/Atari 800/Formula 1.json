{"altername_name": ["Formula 1 Racing"], "name": "Formula 1", "overview": "Formula 1 is a racing game that is most notable for being the first commercial game developed by Sid Meier, before the foundation of MicroProse. The game is played from a top down perspective and the player races against three AI drivers on five different race courses. Four of these are based on real race tracks from around the world; Indy, Monza, Watkins Glen and Monaco. The difficulty level can be set before the race and ranges from amateur to championship. The higher the level the harsher the competition from the AI drivers will get. The player also has to watch out for oil slicks and trees by the tracks. The racing can take place both day and night. The game is played with joystick and the player gets to steer, accelerate, shift gears and brake.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sid Meier", "publishers": "Acorn Software Products", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148530-formula-1\n"}
