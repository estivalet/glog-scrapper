{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bruce Lee", "overview": "Bruce Lee is a platform/beat 'em up hybrid, in which the player controls Bruce Lee. The plot involves the eponymous martial artist advancing from chamber to chamber in a wizard's tower, seeking to claim infinite wealth and the secret of immortality. There are twenty chambers, each represented by a single screen with platforms and ladders. To progress, the player must collect a number of lanterns suspended from various points in the chamber. Most chambers are guarded by two mobile enemies; The Ninja, who attacks with a \"bokken stick\" and The Green Yamo, a large unarmed warrior, visually styled as a sumo wrestler but attacking with punches and \"crushing kicks\". On platforms with sufficient graphics support, Yamo's skin is actually pictured as green, though in cover art he has a natural human skin tone.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ronald J.
