{"altername_name": [], "name": "Harvey Wallbanger", "overview": "A collect'em-up style game created by Tom Hudson and Charles Bachland and published in A.N.A.L.O.G. magazine issue 9 in January 1983. Harvey Wallbanger is situated in the middle of a closed-in room. He may move freely within the room (that part of the screen within the four walls) but the room is constantly getting smaller (the walls are moving in on our rabbit friend.) Harvey is allowed to touch the left and right hand walls, but he will be killed if flattened by these two walls. He is under no circumstances allowed to touch the top and bottom walls, for they are highly electrified. All is not lost for Harvey, however. He does have his patented \"Wallbanger Gun\" to shoot at the walls and make them move away. His only problem is that the speed of the moving walls constantly increases with time. Numbers will appear on the screen that Harvey may collect. These numbers will be added to his score. The faster you collect the numbers, the bigger the final score. The numbers may not be within the confines of the now-receding wall and this will necessitate that Harvey shoot back a wall to access the numbers. Also, Harvey cannot shoot the numbers as this will kill off that particular number and generate a new one someplace else.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "January 3, 1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Charles Bachand", "publishers": "ANALOG Computing", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148956-harvey-wallbanger\n"}
