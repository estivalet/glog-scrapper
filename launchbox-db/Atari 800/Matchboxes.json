{"altername_name": [], "name": "Matchboxes", "overview": "Matchboxes is a combination of a memory/concentration game and a word guessing game. The game is played by two players (the second can be AI or another human) on a grid containing 36 boxes. Upon flipping a box an animated figure is revealed and the aim is to get pairs of the same kind and colour. The player will then get to keep uncovering boxes until a match isn't made. Beneath the grid is a word which is partially revealed as boxes are opened and after every match the player gets a chance to enter the word. The player that first enters the right word wins the game. There are some different variations of the game: one that lacks the word guessing part, one with reversed words and one where the word is scrambled.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Al Cheser", "publishers": "Br\u00f8derbund Software", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/144283-matchboxes\n"}
