{"altername_name": [], "name": "Livewire", "overview": "Livewire was published in Analog Magazine issue #12. Despite being an early type-in program of only 5 kilobytes, Livewire is a very credible imitation of the arcade \"Tempest\". The backstory is different and the maps are actually each of the letters of \"Livewire\" displayed on screen, but the idea is the same - your player controlled character is at one end of a pseudo-3d grid, and enemies come up the grid towards your end, sometimes firing at you. You can also fire down any of the lanes of the grid, and clearing all the enemies this way gets you to the next level. The game can also be played by either joystick or paddles, with paddles further adding to the Tempest-like feel of gameplay.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tom Hudson", "publishers": "ANALOG Computing", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148591-livewire\n"}
