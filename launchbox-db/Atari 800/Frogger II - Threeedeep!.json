{"altername_name": ["Frogger 2: Theeedeep!"], "name": "Frogger II: Threeedeep!", "overview": "In Frogger II: ThreeeDeep!, you need to guide your frog to safety in three different locations. Starting out underwater, reach the top of the pond while avoiding dangerous alligators and fish (you can ride a turtle for safety!). Once on top of the pond, hop across logs, birds, and even a whale to the life preserver trailing behind a tugboat. In the third location you have to hop across a flock of birds to reach a cloud at the top of the screen. Each frog has a time limit to safely reach one of the homes on each of the three screens. You move on to the next level when a frog has safely reached each of the homes on all screens.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Parker Brothers", "publishers": "Parker Brothers", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.62", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogger_II:_ThreeeDeep!", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfvHCC2P9Ig", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/114721-frogger-ii-threeedeep\n"}
