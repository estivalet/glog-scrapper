{"altername_name": [], "name": "Deluxe Invaders", "overview": "Deluxe Invaders can be played by one or two people. The invaders drop down noisily from space to begin the attack. The barriers are present and, just like in the coin-op, can be breached by the player. The UFO also appears across the top of the screen as in real Invaders. The player must shoot all the aliens and clear the screen. Then the invasion begins again with the enemy one row closer to the defending cannon. As you all know by now, no one ever wins this game. Roklan has included some unique game variations to its edition. One interesting idea is that the invaders split into two little aliens when they're blasted by the player. This makes for a totally different style of game. Normal invader strategy goes out the window when this option is chosen. At times there are unusual combinations of large and small aliens in the same row at the same time.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Joe Hellesen", "publishers": "Roklan", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.7", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/6sGoPtSrzJM?t=33s", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/100434-deluxe-invaders\n"}
