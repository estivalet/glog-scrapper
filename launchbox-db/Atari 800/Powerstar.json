Unfortunately, the one man crew of the Powerstar seems to have had a bad bout of cabin fever, and the only message from him in the last week consisted of a facsimile of a Jack Daniels whiskey bottle label. You are the alternate engineer for the Powerstar, and the government has summoned you to active duty. Your mission is to save the vital Powerstar from this nut. Fresh from a vacation in Bango Bango, you arrive at a government field station, and the adventure begins. Powerstar is a graphical adventure with 63 locations.
