{"altername_name": [], "name": "Janosik", "overview": "Janosik wasn't afraid to stand against greedy nobles, avenging their cruelties done to simple folk living in Carpathian Mountains. When the evil baron Herburt found about Janosik's love - Maryna, he captured her and imprisoned her in his castle, hoping to lure Janosik to certain doom. It's up to player if Janosik will succeed in freeing Maryna and repaying the baron for this deed, or fail miserably - hanging on a hook. The game world is divided into forest, village and castle areas. Our hero is armed with shepherd's axe, but he will find other items as well. This platform game is loosely based on the story around Juraj J\u00e1no\u0161\u00edk, a XVII / XVIIIc. Slovak highlander, leader of Carpathian brigands. In Poland the legend was revived by a popular TV series from 1970s, making him a fictional XIXc. gallant folk hero, who only robs the rich Austrian nobles to help oppressed local peasants, \"Robin Hood way\".", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Mirage Software", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgC8rQQ6T6s", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147925-janosik\n"}
