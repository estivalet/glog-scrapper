{"altername_name": [], "name": "Barahir", "overview": "Barahir is a Polish adventure game; as warrior Barahir you have to sneak into a fortress where your friend, wizard Daeron, is imprisoned, and free him. The game interface uses a row of icons at the bottom of the screen: the first icon allows to switch between two music tracks or turns on sound effects instead; the next icons allow to interact with people (talk/bribe/fight), examine an object in the inventory or in environment, use an object, walk in a given direction (choosing a direction on a compass-like selector), check inventory, pick up and drop items. Messages appear as layered text windows. The player can carry up to six items at once. Encountered people can be fought, but each fight saps a little of Barahir's energy; if it runs out, it's a game-over.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Daniel Syzmczuk", "publishers": "L.K.
