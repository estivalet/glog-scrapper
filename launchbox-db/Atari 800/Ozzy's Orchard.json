{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ozzy's Orchard", "overview": "Can you protect the fruit in the orchard from voracious fruit bees through 4 growing seasons? The bees start at the left edge of the screen and randomly weave between rows of the orchard until they reach the bottom right corner of the screen. There, they will gobble up a piece of the 4 apples on the right side of the screen. Ozzy is armed with a spray gun, and tries to shoot the bees. The player has limited spray, and must refill at 1 of the 4 refill stations if empty. The white bees will shoot at the player, and if a white bee touches or shoots the player, they lose a life. If all apples are eaten, it's game over. If all lives are lost, it's game over.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "TG Software", "genres": "", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/149893-ozzys-orchard\n"}
