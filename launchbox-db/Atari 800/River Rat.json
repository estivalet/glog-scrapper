{"altername_name": [], "name": "River Rat", "overview": "The game is a race against time; you are a given a boat and a finite amount of time, the further you get in that time the higher the score. The screen scrolls quickly from top to bottom and your boat has two speeds (changed with the fire key). There are various obstacles in the water; although not all of them are instantly fatal should you hit them, and ramps are provided that provide a way to jump over (and gain points).", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Richard J.
