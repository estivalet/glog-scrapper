{"altername_name": [], "name": "Magia Krysztalu", "overview": "Magia Kryszta\u0142u (Magic of the Crystal) is an action platform game starring the mage Tannatos, out to get revenge on the demon Syrylak for long-time imprisonment. The goal of the game is to find Syrylak and defeat him. The player controls Tannatos as he travels around the game world; similarly to a classic platform game, dexterity in jumping from platform to platform and in avoiding dangers is necessary. Touching an enemy or their projectile kills Tannatos instantly, and there are limited lives. There are numerous items strewn around; Tannatos can carry up to three at once and use them wherever necessary to solve puzzles. Unnecessary items can be dropped in specific spots. An indicator in the corner of the screen shows the progress made in the game so far.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "ASF", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/146894-magia-krysztalu\n"}
