{"altername_name": [], "name": "Munchkin Attack", "overview": "Munchkin Attack is a 1-player variant of Pac-Man for the 8-bit Atari, created by David N. Plotkin and released in December 1982 in SoftSide Magazine Issue #51. The player moves a small character through a maze, while trying to avoid randomly moving ghosts. The player must try to collect all the dots in the maze, as well as the 4 energizers which make the ghosts temporarily vulnerable. If the player collects the dots, they progress to a more difficult level that contains an additional ghost. The player starts with 3 lives, and a life is lost when they contact a ghost. It's game over when all 3 lives are lost.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "David N.
