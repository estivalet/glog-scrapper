{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cavern Battle", "overview": "From Compute!'s Second Book of Atari. Your spaceship hangs poised over a deep cavern, at the bottom of which lies a big blue box full of treasure. The object: get to the bottom of the cavern, retrieve the treasure, and get out again, all the while avoiding or destroying the pterodactyls trying to keep you from reaching the treasure. The pterodactyls can move through the walls of the cavern, but don\u2019t you try it or you\u2019ll blow up! To move your spaceship, use joystick 0, and press the red button to fire your missile. You can only have one missile in flight at a time, so don\u2019t waste them. If the pterodactyls catch you, you\u2019ll probably blow up, so be careful. You have several things in your favor - your ship is faster and there are only so many prehistoric birds per cavern. But they are tenacious and come unerringly for you. When you reach the bottom of the cavern, hover over the treasure and you\u2019ll hear a tune announcing recovery of the treasure. Head for the surface and if you make it, you\u2019ll hear the little tune again. If you want to play again, just start down the cavern again. But this time there will be more pterodactyls. One note of warning: When you first RUN the program, the screen will go blank for about 45 seconds while the caverns are drawn. This is normal.
