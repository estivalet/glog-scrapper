{"altername_name": [], "name": "Volleyball (SoftSide)", "overview": "Being as it's summer, or at least hot enough to be so considered, here's an outdoor favorite: \"Volleyball\" for the Apple, written by Jim Hilger for the Apple II and then updated by Bradley Bell for the Atari line of home computers. SoftSide magazine - SoftSide Magazine Issue 34 - 07/1981, had the original version with updates in Vol.05 No.02 - 11/1981. \"Volleyball\" is an action sports game for four players. Most games are designed for one or two players, probably because it's rare to have more than two game paddles. \"Volleyball\" sidesteps this limitation by allowing two of the players to use keyboard controls, while the other two players use the paddles. Allowing four to participate in the game creates an exciting level of team competition. And if you don't have four players available, it's even more of a challenge for two or three.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "November 2, 1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bradley J.
