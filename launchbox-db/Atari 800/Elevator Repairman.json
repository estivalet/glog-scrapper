{"altername_name": [], "name": "Elevator Repairman", "overview": "The objective of Elevator Repairman is to climb the building to access the engineering room. Unfortunately the only way to accomplish this is to cross the rows of malfunctioning elevators, as climbing is done by a fire escape that alternates left and right each level. If an elevator touches you, you are sent back to the beginning. To add to the difficulty, you can't actually stop moving once running across a lane, only change direction back and forth quickly, so dodging elevators is an exercise in timing in both directions.
