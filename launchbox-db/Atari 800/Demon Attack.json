{"altername_name": [], "name": "Demon Attack", "overview": "Demon Attack is an arcade action game with gameplay similar to Phoenix. You control a laser canon at the bottom of the screen, and need to destroy wave after wave of brightly colored demons. The demons bounce around the screen in bizarre patterns, and try to destroy your canon with bombs or lasers. When you shoot a demon, it will be replaced with another or will split into two smaller demons depending on which wave you are playing. When the required number of demons for the current round is finally destroyed, you can move on to the next, more difficult round. Demon Attack was never released for the Atari 5200 but a homebrew version was created from the Atari 8-bit computer release.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Imagic", "publishers": "Imagic", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.83", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon_Attack", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/i2YKijMrbV0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/144201-demon-attack\n"}
