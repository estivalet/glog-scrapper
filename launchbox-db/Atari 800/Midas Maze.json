{"altername_name": [], "name": "Midas Maze", "overview": "A collect-em up game created by Ken MIller and published in A.N.A.L.O.G. Computing Magazine issue 52 in March of 1987. Your magnetic Gold Grabber will help you in this Action! quest for the gold. You are a Midian and are about to become a player in a robotic car chase contest. The goal to gather as much gold as you can with your remote-controlled Gil (Gold Grabber), a magnetically powered vehicle. This would be fine, except that the Midian Guardian Squad has decided four RIIs (Ramdom Rovers] should roam around the gold vault room, making your goal more difficult. And that's not all. The RIIs have Gil sensors built in. So, if they're within range of your vehicle, you can expect to be the object of a chase. Luckily, there are six gold-transforming objects placed at various locations on the board. For a few seconds, they enable you to spin any and all RIIs, thus sending them back lo their holding station. Even when the RIIs come back again, still golden colored, you may spin them once more. Hitting the gold-transforming objects awards you various points, depending upon the object. Gas cans gain you TOO points, wax cans 200, dynamite 300, oil cans 400 and tacks for 500. But remember, this transforming power is given to you for only a short period of time. Use it wisely, either to pick up more gold coins (100 points), or to try to hit as many RIIs as you can. You will also find that many of the corridors are blocked by vault doors. To open these doors, you must find the proper keys (100) for each.The Guardians have also seen to it that, after you've gathered a certain amount of gold, a money bag will appear on-screen. The money bag's value starts at 1,000 and increases by 1,000 points each board, until it reaches 5,000 \u2014 at which time it returns to 1,000 and starts all over again. For every 10,000 points gained, the Guardians will award you with another GII vehicle to smash up.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "March 2, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ken Miller", "publishers": "ANALOG Computing", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148959-midas-maze\n"}
