{"altername_name": [], "name": "Saigon: The Final Days", "overview": "Splashing through a jungle stream, you know the Cong are seconds behind you. You crash through the brush into a clearing where a chopper is waiting, its motor ticking over. AK-47 rounds rip the air as you throw yourself into the open doorway. In the air, the door gunner's quadmount.5 search out targets, while you crouch on the floor on a flak jacket. Your skin tingles as you wait for the roar of an RPG rocket! Now you too can experience the chaos that was Viet Nam, 1975. You are an escaped American POW lost somewhere in the dense jungle. Your one chance for survival is to reach Saigon - before the Viet Cong reach you . . . . But who knows what you'll find once you get there?", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Adventure International", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40476-saigon-the-final-days\n"}
