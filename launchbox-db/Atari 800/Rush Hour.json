{"altername_name": [], "name": "Rush Hour", "overview": "The player controls a car that must travel across 6 lanes of traffic and a railroad track in order to reach the fuel pumps on the far side. The vehicle will always travel horizontally within lanes, but can be steered left and right. There are 4 fuel pumps, and the player must navigate a vehicle to each of these. After doing this, the game becomes more difficult with thicker traffic. The vehicle has 2 speeds. The player starts with 3 cars, and it's game over if all are lost by hitting another vehicle. There's limited fuel to compete each level.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mark & Susy Odendahl", "publishers": "APX", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148140-rush-hour\n"}
