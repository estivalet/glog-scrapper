{"altername_name": [], "name": "Aerial", "overview": "Aerial is part of a series of games by Japanese developer Inufuto, who builds a single game design and then ports it to a very wide variety of retro hardware. Aerial is a side-scrolling shooter, in which the player pilots a plane viewed from the side scrolling left to right. The joystick is used to pitch the plane up or down, and fire button to fire. The objective is to avoid planes/rockets being launched at the player, and shoot down planes or ground targets when possible. Powerups will also appear that are used by flying over them.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "2022", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Inufuto", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcDNbByamSM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/160935-aerial\n"}
