{"altername_name": [], "name": "Missile Command", "overview": "The player's six cities are being attacked by an endless hail of ballistic missiles, some of them even splitting like multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs). New weapons are introduced in later levels: smart bombs that can evade a less than perfectly targeted missile, and bomber planes and satellites that fly across the screen and launch missiles of their own. As a regional commander of three anti-missile batteries, the player must defend six cities in their zone from being destroyed.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atari", "publishers": "Atari", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.62", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile_Command", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwrCA4sK_1s", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73189-missile-command\n"}
