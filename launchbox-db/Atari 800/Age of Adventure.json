{"altername_name": [], "name": "Age of Adventure", "overview": "Age of Adventure is a combo pack of two previous Stuart Smith games, Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves, and Return of Heracles. In both games you control a top-down view player character and move it around the screen with a joystick (in Return of Heracles, you also have a pet dog to control). Game play is turn based with a certain number of actions in each turn. Maps are much larger than a screen and are revealed as explored. In multiplayer games players can control multiple characters on alternate turns (unusually, with almost any number of players). Control and view behavior were predecessors to many other similar games that game later, for instance the SSI Gold Box series. The engine used for these games was later enhanced to build the 8-bit Adventure Construction Set, also by Smith. In the Atari version, Age of Adventure has a feature to set the speed of Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves, the only release in which this is possible. Versions were also available for the Apple II, and Commodore 64.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Stuart Smith", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "19", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.06", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Return_of_Heracles", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109748-age-of-adventure\n"}
