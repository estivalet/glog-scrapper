{"altername_name": [], "name": "Owari & Bull and Cow", "overview": "Owari & Bull and Cow is a pair of traditional board games: In Owari, the game starts with four seeds in each house. The objective of the game is to capture more seeds than one's opponent. Since the game has only 48 seeds, capturing 25 is sufficient to win the game. Since there is an even number of seeds, it is possible for the game to end in a draw, where each player has captured 24. In Bull and Cow, a random assortment of 4 digits is selected by the computer and must be guessed. A successful guess in the correct position is referred to as a \u2018Bull\u2019, while a successful guess in the wrong position is referred to as a \u2018Cow\u2019. Guessing all numbers in the correct position (four Bulls) wins the round.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Thorn EMI Computer Software", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/167010-owari-bull-and-cow\n"}
