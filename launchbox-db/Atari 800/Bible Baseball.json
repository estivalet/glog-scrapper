{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bible Baseball", "overview": "Bible Baseball is an animated baseball Bible trivia game for 1-2 players. Played on an animated baseball field, the player can compete against the computer or another human. Every time a pitch is thrown, the player is asked a multiple choice Bible question. If the player is batting, and answers an answer correctly, there is a chance they'll successfully score a hit, or potentially a run. If they are wrong, they'll strike out. There is a small chance of getting out even with a correct answer. If competing against the computer, the player must answer questions while pitching, to try to strike their computer opponent out. Each game involves 9 innings, with 3 outs per inning.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Davka Corporation", "publishers": "Davka Corporation", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/153819-bible-baseball\n"}
