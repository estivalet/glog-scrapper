{"altername_name": [], "name": "Space Wars", "overview": "Space Wars is a standard shooter, with the player controlling a spaceship fighting fairly large enemy sprite opponents. You can push your ship forward (up on the screen) but only about halfway, and absent the push on the stick it will settle back to the bottom. Opponents move all about, not in a regular pattern like Space Invaders; it's possible for your ship to touch another without dying, although that depletes your shield (and when your shield is gone you do die). In between the fighter waves you are in an asteroid field which amounts to a dodging game as the asteroids roll down the screen towards your ship.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Paul Marshall", "publishers": "Byte Back", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/145951-space-wars\n"}
