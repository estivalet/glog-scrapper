{"altername_name": [], "name": "Jax-O", "overview": "Jax-o is a 1 - 4 player version of the game Jacks for the 8-bit Atari computer. Each player takes a turn tossing a ball from their side of the play field. They must then quickly move out, grab the required number of jacks, and return to intercept the ball before it hits the far wall and bounces back. As the player completes a field, they are required to pick up more jacks for the next field. If a player makes a mistake, the jacks are rethrown. Make a mistake 3 times, and the turn passes to the next player. There are 7 levels of game difficulty, and players can chose from 4 different sized playing fields. The ball can be fast or slow.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "APX", "genres": "", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/368577-jax-o\n"}
