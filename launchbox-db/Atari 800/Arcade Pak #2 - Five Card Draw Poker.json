{"altername_name": ["Five Card Draw Poker"], "name": "Arcade Pak #2: Five Card Draw Poker", "overview": "Draw Poker is standard poker in the context of common U.S. card games where each player is dealt a five card hand and then can decide if they would like to place a bet on the first round or check (pass). The player in the game is against four other players all controlled by the computer with the names of Lucky, Shifty, Ace and Slim. Players will be dealt five cards from a shuffled deck. All players ante $5 to the pot. Starting as in many poker games the first round requires that to open you must have a pair of Jack\u2019s or higher to start the betting. Then each player in betting rounds hopes to build a better hand by replacing or \"drawing\" cards as needed. Each player begins the game with $2,000 dollars.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Microcomputer Games", "publishers": "The Avalon Hill Game Company", "genres": "Casino", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/369226-arcade-pak-2-five-card-draw-poker\n"}
