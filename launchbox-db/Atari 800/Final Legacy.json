{"altername_name": [], "name": "Final Legacy", "overview": "Final Legacy portrays you as the commander of a last battleship trying to defeat the opposing \"Warmongers\" who are intent on destroying your cities. The game is split into four major modes; navigation, torpedo, sea to land attack, and sea to air attack. Points are awarded at varying rates for enemies downed in any of the modes, as well as how many of your cities survive. Although the different modes are relatively simple shooting exercises, the combined set with a real-time feel to selecting priority targets and working both offense and defense delivers varied gameplay.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Chris Horseman", "publishers": "Atari", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2BmtUPFG3c", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/116689-final-legacy\n"}
