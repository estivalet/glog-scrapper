{"altername_name": [], "name": "Albert", "overview": "\"Albert\" is a PAL-only game released both in a free and commercial version (the commercial version has an additional 10 levels). It features fairly simple platform gameplay; the character Albert runs about gathering gemstones while avoiding insects. While the gameplay is fairly standard, the graphics are exceptional and look more like a 16-bit game instead of over 40-year-old 8bit hardware. The screens are very colorful and detailed, sprites are large, and scrolling smooth as you play through.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "2021", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Janusz Karmanski", "publishers": "Retronics", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfWa4CyehE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161026-albert\n"}
