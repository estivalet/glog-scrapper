{"altername_name": [], "name": "House of Usher", "overview": "House of Usher is an extremely difficult platformer that requires a character looking a little bit like a hunchback to solve riddles in ten rooms to access room X and find the treasure. The riddles have mostly to do with traversing rooms filled with platforms that are breaking away, that are invisible or moving etc.. Sometimes monsters or other obstacles like canon balls have to be avoided. Maneuvering the character is very difficult and the jumps have to be timed very precisely.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "K.
