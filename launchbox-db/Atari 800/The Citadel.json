{"altername_name": ["Cytadela"], "name": "The Citadel", "overview": "The Citadel is a puzzle game where, on each level, the player has to get the protagonist to the exit. The way to the exit is usually blocked with various obstacles: rocks, boxes, pits. Rocks can be pushed around, but only one at a time, and they cannot be pulled. Boxes are similar to rocks, but a row of them can be pushed around as one. Pits need to be filled with a rock or a box, depending on their shape. Teleporters transport the hero to another teleporter. Bombs can be pushed around, and explode when a trigger is pushed, destroying everything (and detonating other bombs) near them. Every level has a time limit. Passwords can be used to skip to later levels.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Joel Goodwin", "publishers": "ASF Software", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148173-the-citadel\n"}
