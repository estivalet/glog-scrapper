The enclosed discs are flipped over to the players color. The game ends when there are no empty tiles left. The player with the most discs on board wins the game.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Mirage Software", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147655-sexversi\n"}
