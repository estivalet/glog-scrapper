If the player makes a mistake the fleet is destroyed. There are 9 levels of difficulty from space private to admiral. At the lowest level, the player sees 2 ships fly into the space port, and must use the menu at the bottom to make sure they exit in order they entered. At higher levels, more spaceships enter, the time to have them exit is limited, the space port can rotate, and ships can exit from both ends of the port.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Interactive Image Teschnologies", "publishers": "Umbrella Software Inc.", "genres": "", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/368786-spaceport\n"}
