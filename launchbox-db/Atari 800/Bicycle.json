{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bicycle", "overview": "An action game created by Dan Devos and published in the From The ANALOG Compendium in 1983, the best Atari home computer programs from the first ten issues of A.N.A.L.O.G. Computing magazine. Bicycle is a one player game. You are a messenger working for the largest shipping company in the world. As part of your daily routine, you must run memos and invoices from the main shipping offices out to the loading and receiving docks. Leaping on your trusty bicycle, you proceed across the vast parking lot, past rows of idling tractor trailer rigs, dodging the many potholes that impede your progress. However, the potholes are not the only things you have to look out for. The drivers of the trucks are in a hurry to leave, and often they can't bother to watch out for one poor little messenger on a bicycle! Needless to say, you have to be careful where you're going! The cyclist is continually proceeding at a fixed rate, and he can also move up and down. Every time you are hit by a truck or fall into a pothole, you lose a cyclist. There is a total of three cyclists in a game. For every space you move, you get one point. For every section of the parking lot, there are two truck drivers walking to their trucks. If you hit a walking truck driver you get 500 points. Watch out! The truck drivers can stand over the pot holes and when the cyclist hits them he falls into the hole.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dan Devos", "publishers": "ANALOG Computing", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148587-bicycle\n"}
