{"altername_name": ["Return of the Mutant Camels"], "name": "Revenge II", "overview": "This game is the second \"Revenge\" game, after Attack of the Mutant Camels (1983) and the first \"Revenge of the Mutant Camels\" (1984). This was released in 1987 without Jeff Minters involvement; confusingly it has a title screen saying \"Revenge of the Mutant Camels\" although the box says \"Revenge II\" and loading screen say \"RMC II\" (for Revenge of the Mutant Camels II). Regardless, much like the others you are running 900-ft tall mutant camels with lasers around shooting their alien captors.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Steven A.
