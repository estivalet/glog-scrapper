{"altername_name": [], "name": "Snowplow", "overview": "An arcade-quality game by Barry Kolbe & Bryan Schappel, published in A.N.A.L.O.G. Computing Magazine issue 64 from September 1988. Your mother begged you to become an orthodontist and straighten out all those crooked ~ teeth. But you just couldn't see spending eight hours a day with your hands in someone else's mouth. So here you are driving a truck for the highway department. Cutting weeds in the summer and filling potholes in the spring. Not to mention burning tons of leaves in the fall. Oh! Then there's winter and all that snow to plow. Follow the center-line markers on the roads until they are completely clear of snow. While you're pushing snowflakes around, storms will occasionally cross your path. If your dozer touches one, it will undoubtedly get diesel line freeze and crash. As time goes on, the storms get more frequent and faster, so beware. Avoid the crazies out driving in the snow, risking their lives. Fortunately, a bell sound warns you that they are on the road. If you hit one, you score a 100-point bonus. These people will honk their horns at you, but I'd just ignore them and keep going. And don't forget to keep your gas tank full. Remember the Knight-Rider and KIT? Me neither. But KIT had turbo boost. And can jump to the edge of the screen (assuming there's a road there; you wouldn't want to jump into a tree, would you?). If you need to clean off your windshield or take a sip of coffee during plowing, just hit any key to pause. Press a key again to continue. Well, what are you waiting for?
