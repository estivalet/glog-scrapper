{"altername_name": [], "name": "Robot Knights", "overview": "How brave are you? Are you brave enough to handle the hazards of Evil Otto's dungeons? No problem if you are a Robot Knight. You have to stop Otto from waking his latest creation-a monster that could destroy the whole of FUTUREWORLD! You find yourself in Otto's dungeon which is full of his creations such as Zombies that throw fireballs at you. The only way you can kill these creatures is to deflect the fireballs back at them by using your shield or firing your bow at them (This depends on whether you are SIR BRAVE or SIR BOLD). You must avoid being touched by the Zombies ... that results in all your precious energy points being absorbed and you will self destruct. You can build your energy points by keeping your eyes peeled for various objects you can collect like Energy Condensers; Treasure; Oil Cans. You must collect everything on each level ... and destroy all the creatures if you want proceed to the next level. Ultimately you must find Otto's laboratory and the monster and destroy both of them - simple, isn't it? - Only if you are skilled enough. To move use the joystick. To jump press the fire button. To fire (Sir Bold) pull joystick back and press fire. Be warned, in competition knights can attack each other by accident. So be careful which way you fire!! Should you need a break, press Space bar.
