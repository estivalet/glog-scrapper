{"altername_name": [], "name": "Zeppelin", "overview": "Zeppelin is similar to the 1981 arcade game Vanguard, in that you are playing a shooter with a ship navigating caves that has four-directional fire capability. You are the pilot of the zeppelin, and your mission is to explore the 250 rooms of the caverns, locate dynamite and blow up the enemy lair on each of 7 different levels. Along the way you will battle enemy zeppelins, hamburger creatures (that you can feed hamburgers you find), switches to open doors, and many other dangers. Unlike many action/arcade games, Zeppelin has a cooperative feature in which multiple players can share responsibility for the ship, split between pilot and gunners.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "William Mataga", "publishers": "Synapse Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/112721-zeppelin\n"}
