{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gem Drop", "overview": "Gem Drop is a fast-paced puzzle game and is based on the concept of Magical Drop III. The goal is to clear all gems on the screen before they squash the character at the bottom of the screen. The player controls the character at the bottom and can collect up to ten gems of the same color. These are then launched at the ones at the top to knock them off the screen. When three of more gems of the same color connect, they match and explode. Any adjacent games of the same color will also explode, causing chain reactions. A higher score is provided for making more gems disappear in one go.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "September 5, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "New Breed Software", "publishers": "New Breed Software", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147389-gem-drop\n"}
