{"altername_name": [], "name": "Little Devil", "overview": "This game was clearly \"inspired by\" Bomb Jack, and has similar platform play characteristics - various maps, a character that can make giant jumps to retrieve items on the levels of the platform (in this case, \"souls\" that have a countdown timer and are lost after they reach zero). Touching any of the monsters coming after you will result in death. Occasionally bonus items to retrieve appear which are moving unlike souls. If you are about to run out on timers, you can reset them using the Select key, but only three times in a game.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Don Rigby", "publishers": "Byte Back", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/150706-little-devil\n"}
