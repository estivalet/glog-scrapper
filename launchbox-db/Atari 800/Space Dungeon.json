{"altername_name": [], "name": "Space Dungeon", "overview": "Space Dungeon is a modification of the 5200 game to work with 8-bit computer joystick inputs. Like the 5200 version, if you have two sticks you can use them together, left one to maneuver and right one to fire in a joystick direction. If you don't have two sticks, you must press the fire button on the left stick and hold it in the direction you want to shoot, pausing your movement. You are the commander of a space archaeological expedition, gathering up the scant remains of a distant planet. Your mission is to collect these treasures, which hold the key to the planet's destruction, and take them to a crystal-powered computer. Scientists believe that the information garnered from the cosmic chunks could save Earth from a fate similar to that of the destroyed planet.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atari (USA)", "publishers": "Atari", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Dungeon", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/144642-space-dungeon\n"}
