{"altername_name": ["ROTO"], "name": "R.O.T.O.", "overview": "R.O.T.O. is an Analog take on the commercial game H.E.R.O. The game was originally provided in Action! language from the magazine. Deep in caverns under Arcadia, fuel canisters of semi-matter ore to power the city's defensive shield have been cached away against the day when the aliens would return. Composed o/ mixed-charge matter, hyke (as it is called] is easily persuaded to annihilate itself in the manner of matter-antimatter reactions, but is more easily stored. Now that the attack has begun, brave volunteer retrievers must don helipacks, fly down into the caves and bring up the ore, so that Arcadia may not fall.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mike Stortz", "publishers": "ANALOG Computing", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148961-roto\n"}
