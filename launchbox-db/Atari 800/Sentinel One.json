The player confronts progressively more lengthy enemy waves, but the enemies do not become more difficult. The player has limited fuel to complete each wave, and when enough enemy ships are destroyed, the player refuels, and starts a new wave. The player has 3 ships, and it's game over when all are lost.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Inhome Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/144684-sentinel-one\n"}
