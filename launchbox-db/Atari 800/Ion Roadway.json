If you win, you'll be set free to race again, if not, you and even your memory will be erased from the universe. The player controls a car than can move left and right, and is capable of reverse, neutral, and 4 speeds. The player must race along the track while avoiding opponent antimatter cars. The player has 5 vehicles, and it's game over when all are lost. The player has limited fuel, and must refill every lap by stopping in the pits. The player gains bonus points by hitting green bonus posts, but these temporarily spin out the vehicle.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "APX", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148119-ion-roadway\n"}
