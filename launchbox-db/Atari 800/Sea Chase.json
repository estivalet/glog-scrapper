{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sea Chase", "overview": "Sea Chase is an action game with the player controlling a submarine destroying depth charges dropped from above. The player starts in a minefield; touching any of the mines will destroy the sub. A destroy patrols above dropping depth charges, which can be shot with torpedoes from the sub. The sub itself has inertia so moving without touching a mine can become difficult. Randomly on the map there will be a glowing \"treasure\"; this replenishes the subs oxygen, and after capturing ten of them the sub receives an anti-destroyer missile which allows you to advance to the next level. At higher levels a red enemy sub may also appear. Sea Chase was written by Ed Fries, who went on to a career at Microsoft that included helping form the Xbox gaming division.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ed Fries", "publishers": "Romox", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/145107-sea-chase\n"}
