{"altername_name": [], "name": "Space Bowl", "overview": "Space Bowl is a 2 - 4 player soccer-like game for the Atari 400/800. A 3 - on - 3 sports game for 2 - 4 players featuring large insects as players. Each team has a small net which continues to scroll vertically across the sides of the screen. 4 points are rewarded every time a shot is scored. Gameplay options allow the player to define the time per game and number of players. Each player controls one insect on the field at a time, and can pass or shoot. The player who next gets the ball becomes the active player. The defensive player can intercept passes or kicks, and can take the ball away from player who has the ball. The game has basic rules for a ball going offside, where it is returned to the opposing team. At the end of regulation time, the player with the most points wins. If it is a tie, the players go to sudden death overtime.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Gamma Software", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/144681-space-bowl\n"}
