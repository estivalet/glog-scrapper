Despite appearing separately in many collections, these games were distributed together originally. Starfire is reminiscent of Star Raiders/dogfight ship combat; the player turns their ship vertically and horizontally, always firing to the center of the screen. Fire One is a submarine game, shooting torpedos from the bottom of the screen to ships, with a sonar display at the top of the screen.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Epyx", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/159467-arcade-classics-starfire-and-fire-one\n"}
