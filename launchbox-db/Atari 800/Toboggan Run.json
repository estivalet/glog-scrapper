There will also be \"chasms\" appearing in the field which are bottomless pits. If you ride into a chasm or tree, you will lose the game. When you maneuver the toboggan to the bottom of the screen you will be awarded points based on the number of trees on the screen. You will then advance to the next level of play.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "General Masters Corporation", "publishers": "ALA Software", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/368807-toboggan-run\n"}
