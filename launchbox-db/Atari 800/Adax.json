{"altername_name": [], "name": "Adax", "overview": "Adax is an arcade adventure game where the player becomes a special agent, dispatched by the Earth military to the planet Adax in order to blow up a secret alien base and recover several disks with secret info. The agent must travel around the six sectors of the planet, dodging or killing dangers and finding crates with objects inside--such as keys, ammo, \"spheres\" or disks. The enemies can be dispatched by kicking or punching them, by shooting them with a pistol (though ammo is limited), or by tossing \"spheres\" that roll along the ground and explode on impact. The \"spheres\" can also destroy the ever-present landmines which otherwise have to be jumped over. The keys can open locked doors, but are one-use. In an adventure game fashion, there are also special items with specific uses. Each sector contains a vehicle that can take the agent to any other sector. Contact with an enemy or falling from a height drains the agent's health, but killing enemies restores health.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Rafa\u0142 W\u00f3jcik", "publishers": "L.K.
