{"altername_name": [], "name": "Robal, Duch", "overview": "This is a compilation of two games:- 1) Robal is an adaptation of the classical concept of snake games. The player has to guide a worm through a labyrinth. The player must feed the worm to score points and gain access to the next board, however feeding the worm makes it grow longer. The worm loses a life when he bites its own tail. If the worm manages to eat all the fireflies, he will be transferred to the next level. 2) Duch is a side-scrolling arcade game. The player's task is to find all magical items scattered around the maze. Only one item is visible at a time, after collecting it another object appears. Contact with obstacles and enemies takes away some energy. The player can find or buy in the store a few useful items, such as missiles, dynamite, extra energy, oxygen bottle, balloon, fire, money.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Piotr Kulikiewicz", "publishers": "Mirage", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147932-robal-duch\n"}
