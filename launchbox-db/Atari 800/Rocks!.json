{"altername_name": [], "name": "Rocks!", "overview": "A game from Douglas Engel and published in A.N.A.L.O.G. magazine issue 54 in May of 1987. The crew was ecstatic\u2014after tour years of searching. an inhabitable star system had been found for the Earth's refugees. As the fleet passed each of the ten planets of the system, scanners showed more signs of the ancient civilization that once prospered here. There were even some energy readings. A landing party was dispatched to investigate. Its members returned with reports of gigantic pyramids, huge underground cities, massive nuclear furnaces, giant radioactive waste dumps\u2014 and no signs of life. The star system was soon brought back to life. People moved into the underground cities and activated thee reactors. The advanced technology of the civilization was harnessed to create impenetrable defense screens of artificial asteroids called Rocks, to protect each planet from the aliens who had destroyed the colonists' home. Everything seemed to be progressing very well, until the day the colony discovered what had happened to the former inhabitants of the system. The nuclear waste dumps would continue to increase in radiation until it reached now-critical levels. You've been assigned to the radiation dispersal team working to save as many of the plants as possible. Using remote controlled shuttle pods, you must carefully navigate a pod through the rocks and land on the disposal pad, where a canister will be loaded. Next pilot back and teleport the canister into one of the passing fleet ships for transport into deep space.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "May 1, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Douglas Engel", "publishers": "ANALOG Computing", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148963-rocks\n"}
