{"altername_name": [], "name": "Preppie!", "overview": "Preppie! is a Frogger imitation, in which instead of a frog you control a preppy trying to retrieve his golf balls from a shore across the screen; along the way you must dodge groundskeepers and golf carts, then maneuver from log to log in a stream. When all balls are retrieved you progress to the next level. There are ten levels in all. Preppie! received high scores at release and was regularly called out for extraordinary graphics and music for a 1982 game. The four voice music and complex graphics without flicker were considered demonstrations of the Atari 8-bit power relative to competitors. The source code for the game and it's sequel were donated by the author Wetmore to the Internet Archive in 2016.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Russ Wetmore", "publishers": "Adventure International", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preppie!_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/108510-preppie\n"}
