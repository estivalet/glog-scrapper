{"altername_name": ["Mercenary: Kompendium Ausgabe"], "name": "Mercenary: Compendium Edition", "overview": "A compilation of Paul Woakes's 3D exploration and flight game Mercenary, and the Second City expansion pack. Having crash-landed on the planet Targ, the player's main objective is to find a means of escape. There are several ways to achieve this end. A civil war between two factions affords the player an opportunity to earn money to buy their escape from Targ. Mercenary: The Second City, released in 1986, is an expansion pack. Initially its major distinction is the new color scheme, however, after a similar objective, the substantive differences reveal themselves subtly: there is a different city layout, a more intricate underground complex, a new set of puzzles to overcome and several significant changes with game objects.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Paul Woakes", "publishers": "Novagen Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercenary_(video_game)#Re-releases", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/168560-mercenary-compendium-edition\n"}
