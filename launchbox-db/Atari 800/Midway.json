{"altername_name": [], "name": "Midway", "overview": "Midway is a 1 player versus computer variant of the board game Battleship. Played on a 17 x 8 grid, each player places 10 ships, and each ship only takes up one space. Ships have different point values, and each player starts with 1 carrier, 1 tanker, 2 battleships, 3 destroyers, and 3 submarines. Each player takes a turn typing in a coordinate to see if they hit and destroy the enemy vessel. Previously played squares are shown on the board. Players get to decide how many turns the game will last, and the player with the highest score at the end is the victor.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "R.
