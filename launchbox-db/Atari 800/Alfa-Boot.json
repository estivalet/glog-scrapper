{"altername_name": [], "name": "Alfa-Boot", "overview": "Alfa-Boot is a Polish language adventure game with a point-and-click interface; the protagonist is a special agent, sent out to stop a radioactive leak in a nuclear submarine down in the ocean. The game uses a simple interface where the player can move a cursor around to select an object in the first-person-view image of the location he's in, and interact with this object in a number of ways. Many objects can be examined, with their descriptions appearing at the bottom of the screen. There is also an ever-present \"go\" option which allows the player to follow any exit out of the room, including those not visible on screen.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "StanBit", "publishers": "StanBit", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/149686-alfa-boot\n"}
