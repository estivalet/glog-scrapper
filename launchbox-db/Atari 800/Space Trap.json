{"altername_name": [], "name": "Space Trap", "overview": "Space Trap is a 1-player space-themed arcade game for the Atari 8-bit computer. The player must destroy all Anthorian spacecraft before the black hole closes, and the player is lost forever. The player controls a small spaceship that can move in all directions and fire directly forwards. Navigation consists of setting a ship's horizontal and vertical thrust, and the ship will continue in that direction until alternative force is applied. The ship can fire directly forwards, and turns by alternating thrust. A number of Anthorian ships sit outside the black hole, and the player has limited fuel to try to destroy all of these. If the player runs out of fuel, the black hole starts to close, and the Anthorian ships are restored. If the player strikes the green barrier, they are rapidly propelled in the opposite direction. When the black hole fully closes, it is game over.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Artworx", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148034-space-trap\n"}
