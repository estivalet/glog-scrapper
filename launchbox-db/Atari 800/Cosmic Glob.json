{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cosmic Glob", "overview": "A one or two player shooter, published in A.N.A.L.O.G. Computing Magazine issue 48, November 1986, page 96. In the year 2500, a giant energy cluster heads toward the Earth. Fighters are sent to intercept; only one returns. Is this the end? The surviving fighter brings little hope.

With the formation trapped in a weakening force field just short of the planet, you must destroy the horror before it destroys you \u2014 and the Earth.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "November 3, 1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Rich B.
