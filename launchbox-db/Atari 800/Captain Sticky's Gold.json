{"altername_name": [], "name": "Captain Sticky's Gold", "overview": "Captain Sticky's gold is a non-scrolling, 2D game with an underwater theme. The player assumes the role of a diver, and has to collect gold bars appearing randomly on one of three submerged platforms. To reach them, the diver has to avoid fast moving fish, enemies (which he can shoot with his harpoon), deadly force fields, and bombs dropped from a helicopter. To complicate matters further, there's also a limited air supply, and an overall time limit. There are 8 levels, which then repeat at a higher difficulty.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Steven Riding", "publishers": "English Software Company", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Software", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2BittOmDnc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/110508-captain-stickys-gold\n"}
