{"altername_name": [], "name": "Jeepers Creepers", "overview": "Jeepers Creepers is an arcade game for the Atari 8-bit system. The player controls a small insect which must travel around the lines of a board trying to fill in all the squares. Hunting the player are yellow wasps, which if they catch the player, causes them to lose a life. If the player surrounds an insect square, a wasp-eating beetle will be released which will hunt down some of the wasps which chase the player. When the player surrounds a key, it transports them to a random level. When the player has filled in all boxes on a level, they advance to the next level. The player has a total of 3 lives, and if all are lost, it's game over.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Quality Software", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/144701-jeepers-creepers\n"}
