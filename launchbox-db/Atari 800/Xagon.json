{"altername_name": [], "name": "Xagon", "overview": "Xagon is somewhat like Q*bert, in that you jump about on a set of hexagon pillars, but arranged differently, and the purpose is not to change the colors to be alike, but get all the pillars to the same elevation (when you jump on them, they move down, and then periodically move up when you are not on top of them). To make it more complicated, other creatures will spawn that kill you if they touch you, and occasionally a money bag appears that gives a bonus score.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "David Pentecost", "publishers": "MACE", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnVjbXSGwAI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151507-xagon\n"}
