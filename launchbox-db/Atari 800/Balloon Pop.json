{"altername_name": [], "name": "Balloon Pop", "overview": "Balloon Pop is a 1-player arcade game for the 8-bit Atari. The player controls a small see-saw that can be moved horizontally on the bottom of the screen. A character jumps from the side of the screen, and the player must move the upper end of the see-saw under the character as they fall, to propel the character on the other side up into the air. On the top of the screen are a number of balloons that the player attempts to pop by bouncing their characters into them. If the character falls to the floor without the see-saw properly positioned beneath them, a life is lost. The player starts with 5 lives, and it's game over when all are lost. There are 2 levels of gameplay, that have different see-saw widths.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "White Bag Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/166141-balloon-pop\n"}
