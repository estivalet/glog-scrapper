{"altername_name": [], "name": "Clonus II", "overview": "Clonus II is a graphical adventure game for the Atari 400/800. You have wandered into the city of the future, circa 2086. You have no money nor belongings, but your goal is to create a clone of yourself. There is a large city to explore, and the player must make enough money to buy a head, torso, two arms, and two legs, to create a clone. After creating a clone, the player is hunted by the police force, regularly throwing the player in jail when they are discovered. The player can walk out of jail unharmed, though, as there are no bars in the jail. The city layout is identical to that seen in the original Clonus. There is an arena where the player can battle a gladiator, a casino to make money, and a clone store which sells body parts. There are various warp chambers throughout the city, which take the player to special locations including a troglodyte cavern and the offices of the game's developer. Several zones have wandering monsters which will attack the player. When the player encounters a monster, they will lose 10 units of energy in their defeat of the creature. The player starts with a total of 100 energy units, and when all are lost, it's game over.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Crystalware", "publishers": "Crystalware", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148052-clonus-ii\n"}
