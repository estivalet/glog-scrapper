{"altername_name": ["Dianes"], "name": "Diane's Magic Game", "overview": "Diane's Magic Game is a ROM hack of Dan Strikes Back, a 1-player arcade game for the 8-bit Atari. The only real difference is the title screen. Your diamond has been stolen and it is a girl's best friend! You must travel steadily deeper into a series of caverns. On each level, you must trample the mushrooms and collect the small diamonds to open the passageway to the next deeper level of the vault. The player must avoid the creatures that roam the underground caverns, and all the while a Blob slowly chases after the player. The player can move horizontally and downwards, they can also move vertically while in tight vertical shafts. If the player strikes an enemy, they lose a life. Three lives lost, and it's game over.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/149499-dianes-magic-game\n"}
