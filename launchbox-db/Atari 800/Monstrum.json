{"altername_name": [], "name": "Monstrum", "overview": "Monstrum is an adaptation of the classical concept of snake games. The player has to guide a pink snake that is constantly moving through a scrolling labyrinth. The player must feed the snake to score points and gain access to the next board, however feeding the snake makes it grow longer. The snake loses a life when he bites its own tail or falls into the skull. If the snake manages to eat all the dots, the level exit will open and allow access to the next level of the labyrinth. If the player will do the job before the time runs out he receives bonus points for each remaining second.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "ASF", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/146074-monstrum\n"}
