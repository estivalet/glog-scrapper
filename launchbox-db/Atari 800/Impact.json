{"altername_name": [], "name": "Impact", "overview": "Impact is a 2 - 4 player arcade game for the 8-bit Atari computer. Each play controls a skimmer, which can move in all directions, and has inertia. Each skimmer is armed with a bumper, which will temporarily enact a forcefield around their vessel. If the player hits an unshielded vessel, they'll destroy it. After the shield expires, that vessel is temporarily defenseless until the shield can recharge. If 2 unshielded vessels collide, both are destroyed. Each player starts with the same number of vessels, and the last player standing is the victor. Players can set a timed game, and can give different players a handicap, allowing their shields to last longer. There are 17 different game boards to choose from.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "APX", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148118-impact\n"}
