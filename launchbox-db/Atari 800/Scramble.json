{"altername_name": [], "name": "Scramble", "overview": "Scramble is a high quality port of the original arcade game to Atari 8-bit. It is available for both 5200 and computer versions (differing only in joystick control due to the hardware differences there). It is available commercially in cartridge form for the original hardware. The player must navigate their ship across a side-scrolling terrain through six unique stages. Each stage has its own challenges and obstacles, including ground targets, rockets, fuel tanks, flying saucers and meteors. The player must avoid or destroy these hazards while maintaining the ship's limited fuel supply. The objective is to reach the end stage and destroy the enemy's base while trying to get a high score. How To Play: To play Scramble, use the joystick to navigate your ship over the terrain while avoiding the enemy attacks. Press the fire button to launch missiles and drop bombs (configurable from the options screen, if the setting is not \"both\" use space bar to drop bombs). Points are scored for traveling a certain distance and destroying enemy installations. Additional fuel is gained by destroying the fuel tanks. A player starts with 3 ships; a bonus ship is awarded at 10,000 points and every 50,000 points. The game ends when all ships have been destroyed.
