{"altername_name": [], "name": "Super Pac-Man", "overview": "Super Pac-Man is the third title of the Pac-Man series of games, released in Japan on August 11, 1982 and North America on October 1, 1982 in arcades. It is also the second game to be created by series originator Namco, as Ms. Pac-Man (the second in the series) and Pac-Man Plus (released a few months before Super Pac-Man) were created without Namco's involvement. Like in its predecessors, Pac-Man must clear the maze in order to pass the level. But instead of eating dots, he must open the gates with trapped Fruit inside, which can be done by eating Keys (all fruit must be eaten to finish the stage, but not all keys are required). In earlier levels, keys unlock nearby doors, but later levels switch up the locations to be very far away from each other. Power Pellets also make a return, following the same formula as in other Pac-Man games. The Atari 8-bit platform version of the game was a functionally complete prototype, but Atari never released the version due to the sale of Atari in 1984.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Landon Dyer", "publishers": "Unreleased Prototype", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Pac-Man", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAoXWTmQnp0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/135598-super-pac-man\n"}
