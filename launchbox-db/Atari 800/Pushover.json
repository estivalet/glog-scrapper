{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pushover", "overview": "Pushover is a 1 - 2 player puzzle game for the Atari 8-bit computer. You're locked in a life-or-death struggle with your opponent high atop a two-sided cliff. As quickly as possible, you must interpret three or more command symbols. The player must as quickly as possible respond to the command with the joystick. Options include: arrows, numbers, letters, and a mix of these. When a player makes a correct answer, they push their opponent closer to the edge. When a player loses 3 rounds, it's game over.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Joel Gluck", "publishers": "APX", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/150917-pushover\n"}
