The player selects a number, and must then move across a field of elephants by only stepping on those that are a multiple of the number selected. If the player moves to the top of the screen and back, they can chose a new number. If they complete all of the numbers, then they go to a higher challenge with more numbers available. If they miss an elephant or step on the wrong elephant, they must restart the challenge.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "SageSoftware", "publishers": "APX", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148139-ringmaster\n"}
