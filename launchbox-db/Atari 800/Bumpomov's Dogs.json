{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bumpomov's Dogs", "overview": "Bumpomov's Dogs is a 2-player arcade game for the 8-bit Atari computer. Two dogs must move through a maze, trying to pick up the small bones lying on the ground. Each dog can hold a maximum of 30 bones at a time, and the player must return their collected bones to their doghouse for safety. Each dog can throw dog treats, which if they strike their opponent, will cause them to drop all their collected bones. The dogs can not stop nor reverse direction, and can only change direction when they encounter an intersection within the maze. The first player to safely return 100 bones to their doghouse is the winner. When two characters become separated within the maze, the game switches to a split screen mode.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gray Chang", "publishers": "APX", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148113-bumpomovs-dogs\n"}
