{"altername_name": [], "name": "Battle Eagle", "overview": "Battle Eagle was an entry into the 2013 ABBUC Software contest. It is a vertical scrolling shooter game, in which you use the joystick to maneuver your ship to avoid walls while simultaneously shooting various ships and obstacles that appear. Sometimes there are multiple paths through an area to choose from. The guns on the player ship autofire when the trigger is held down, and it requires multiple hits to take out most enemies; so it is best to simply keep the button held down during gameplay.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "2013", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Cosine Systems", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wr5oa0gJqJQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/149723-battle-eagle\n"}
