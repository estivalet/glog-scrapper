{"altername_name": [], "name": "Jellybeans", "overview": "In JellyBeans you must remove JellyBeans from a \"lockbox\" before it fills up. The lockbox can hold a maximum of 75 JellyBeans in a 5x15 configuration. There are five different colored JellyBeans, which can be removed by matching 3, 4 or 5 JellyBeans in the center row of the box. The lockbox will always contain a minimum of 25 JellyBeans. Removing 3 or more of these JellyBeans will cause the lockbox to regenerate the missing JellyBeans. This leaves room for 50 more JellyBeans, but watch out!!! However, the lockbox will periodically generate 3 extra JellyBeans. The period of time between each succesive generation will be shorter than the last. This means that the Jellybean generations will become faster, and faster, so you must keep up!!!", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "2004", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "", "developers": "Chris Martin", "publishers": "", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/150540-jellybeans\n"}
