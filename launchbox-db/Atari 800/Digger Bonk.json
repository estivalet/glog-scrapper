{"altername_name": ["Diggerbonk!", "Diggerbonk"], "name": "Digger Bonk", "overview": "Diggerbonk is a 1-player arcade maze game for the 8-bit Atari computer. You are an alien, who has landed on Titan, the moon of Saturn. Your goal is to clear out the dangerous mine shaft, and collect the valuable Titan ore. The player controls a small square who moves about a maze that continuously scrolls from the top. The player must move quickly, for if they get caught on the bottom on the screen, the game is over. The goal is to reach 30,000 points, and there are 9 levels of progressive difficulty. If the player hits the enemies of the maze, it's game over. Enemies include: purple gurples, yellow blinkers, and aqua-chasers. Energy fields and timebombs also provide dangers. Some powerups can temporarily make the player invincible, or allow them to break through a section of wall.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Steve Robinson", "publishers": "Antic Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/150354-digger-bonk\n"}
