{"altername_name": ["Chopperoids"], "name": "Chopperoid", "overview": "Published in Compute Magazine December 1983 Issue 043. You're a chopperoid pilot on a life-and-death mission: Navigate through the deadly asteroid field to reach a disintegrating satellite with nine scientists on board. You must transport them one at a time back through the asteroid field to the safety of the heliport. Written for the Atari, a joystick or trackball is required. This game is entirely in machine language for speed and smooth motion. The problems involved in cleaning up chemical waste dumps have caused such a public outcry that all future chemical research has been banished to space. One chemical company has placed its research facilities on a satellite in geosynchronous orbit just beyond a dense asteroid field. The rationale was that the asteroids would provide a natural security system to prevent other companies from pilfering top-secret company formulas. However, an experiment on the satellite has gotten out of control and gallons of a potent solvent have leaked out. This chemical is so strong that it's causing the satellite itself to dissolve. Nine scientists are trapped on board, and you must take to your chopperoid and brave the asteroid field to save them.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "L.L.
