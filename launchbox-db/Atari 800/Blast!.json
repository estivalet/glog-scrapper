{"altername_name": [], "name": "Blast!", "overview": "From A.N.A.L.O.G. magazine issue 44 from July 1986. The control room of the Space Defense Center was chaotic. Technicians milled about, carrying their reams of printouts; white-haired scientists debated the reliability of the McPherison fusion shield in outer space, and military officials barked orders to nobody in particular. The date was September 23; the year was 2140. Titan 16, a research probe orbiting the planet Pluto, had picked up evidence of an object traveling at near light speed. This in itself wasn't particularly remarkable. Several natural phenomena were known to attain speeds of that magnitude. What was making the scientists and the military so nervous was that the object was headed directly toward Earth. Even more ominous: it had changed course to avoid a comet in its path. the thing continued on its present course, it would reach Earth in less than ten days. The world trembled with anticipation. Almost everyone agreed that it was an alien artifact of some sort.That was about the only thing everyone could agree on. One person's answer to the important questions was as good as any other's . . .What was it? Were there aliens on board? Would they be friendly? Most important, why was the object coming? Five days later, the first photographs of the object were transmitted to Earth by Titan 8, orbiting Saturn. The subject was a blue dome of about 50 meters in diameter. It was covered with black and green markings, presumably writing of some sort. On the dome's base, two dish-shaped devices like radio telescopes were attached. There was a large hole in the center of the base of the dome. Still the artifact hurtled toward the Earth. Finally, as predicted by the scientists, it reached its \"target.\" Unfortunately, it seemed to know more about Earth than the Earth's creatures knew about it. It was in geosynchronous orbit directly above the Space Defense Center. The planet waited. For two days, the object hovered over the Space Defense Center. It was decided to send fifteen of Earth's newest ships to meet the object and attempt to make contact. The messenger ships were 6 kilometers from the artifact when seven creatures emerged from its large hole. They sped toward the greeting party, seized the ships and dragged them into the craft. The ships were never heard from again. Nobody was quite sure what to make of this hostility from the alien ship. The World Congress debated for 48 hours before deciding to send three more ships to meet it. This set of ships would be armed, however. If the creatures wanted to come out and steal more of Earth's fleet, they'd have a fight on their hands. Blast! continued Still the artifact hurtled toward the Earth.

As you approach the alien craft, the two dishes detach from the dome and separate. There's a brief flash of light, then a gray force field springs into being between your command ship and the alien vessel. The creatures emerge from the artifact. They penetrate the field easily. If your ship is destroyed you'll be teleport- ed to one of the remaining ones, so you aren't that concerned with your safety. You doubt that they can stand up to the high-energy particle beam generator mounted on the front of your ship, anyway. Indeed, you clear away the first twelve creatures with ease. But what's this? The field is coming closer! It will be harder to dodge the creatures now. .", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "July 1, 1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Steven Grimm", "publishers": "ANALOG Computing", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148951-blast\n"}
