The player controls a nebulous cloud which, scrolls horizontally at the top of the screen. Below the player, numerous hamburgers take flight, veering off on strange angles. The player must fire down and destroy the hamburgers. If the player comes in contact with a burger, they grow larger. At the end of each round, the player shrinks a bit, but if they grow too large, they will explode, ending the game. Waves have progressively more burgers, and the player begins to encounter larger burgers which split into smaller burgers when hit. Finally, on the last stage, the player encounters the boss burger, which is the width of the game field.
