{"altername_name": [], "name": "Go Elwood Go!", "overview": "Released for the Silly Venture programming contest in 2010, Go Elwood Go! is a side scrolling game in which you control the mentioned Elwood, who happens to strongly resemble a character with a brother from some blues movie. Bullets appear on the right in groups of threes and randomly release towards you, and occasional alligators/cars also appear running along the surface. You can jump over things and fire a shot one a time; a fired shot jumps with you (up and down), so it's possible to curve a shot into an enemy bullet at times.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "2010", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gonzo", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/150265-go-elwood-go\n"}
