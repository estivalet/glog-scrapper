{"altername_name": [], "name": "Kiki Pong", "overview": "Kiki Pong is unsurprisingly a Pong variant; the game can feature 1 or 2 players and has a sideways playing field. A player controls a typical paddle, but the objective instead of eliminating the other player is to hit various toys on the playing field (you are \"cleaning up your room\"). When two players are present they cooperate with the goal of cleaning up all the toys.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "2013", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bartek Gatz", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/150632-kiki-pong\n"}
