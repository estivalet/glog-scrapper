You control a spaceship at the bottom of the screen and need to defend yourself from numerous waves of attackers. But in MegaMania, the attackers are much more bizarre than invading aliens. There are hamburgers, diamonds, steam irons, bow ties, space dice, and more! You need to earn points by destroying as many of these strange attackers as you can before your energy supply becomes depleted.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Activision", "publishers": "Activision", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megamania", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/Gdas2K6DKVQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72122-megamania\n"}
