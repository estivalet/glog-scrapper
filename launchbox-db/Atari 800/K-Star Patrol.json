{"altername_name": [], "name": "K-Star Patrol", "overview": "A side scrolling shooter with some interesting features for an early title. You control a ship on the left of the screen with your joystick with a patrol squadron behind you, you can move up or down, and fire. Moving to the right increases your speed, moving the stick to your left activates a shield in front of your patrol to protect them. Pushing the stick in a 360 rotation will detonate a screen-wide bomb; you get one bomb per completed level. Alien ships attack terrain your are crossing, and in later levels there are surface mounted guns that fire at you, and a \"leech\" creature that cannot be destroyed (but can be repelled) by your guns. If the leech gets too close, it will drain all of the energy from your ship, and your only choice is to use a bomb.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "CBS Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/144592-k-star-patrol\n"}
