{"altername_name": [], "name": "Lawkeeper", "overview": "Unreleased prototype. The game involves a square \"jail\" in the middle of the screen, with characters running around the edges. You patrol the inside square, always linked to it, and can extend a line to the edge of the screen to capture the characters, putting them inside the jail. Eventually parts of the jail are broken down and you need to repair it (by rolling over the destroyed segments).", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "", "developers": "Mike Contos", "publishers": "Unreleased Prototype", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/145191-lawkeeper\n"}
