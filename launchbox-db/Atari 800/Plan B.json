{"altername_name": [], "name": "Plan B", "overview": "Conversion of the BBC Micro version of the same name. Plan B was developed and published by Bug-Byte Software for both the BBC Micro and the Acorn Electron in 1986. It was programmed by Andrew Foord with music by Peter Foord. You control a war drone teleported inside the computer complex and must find and destroy all the computer parts and then escape, while constantly fighting off the security robots. Extra rockets can be picked up and oil cans and spanners will replenish your energy, but be careful not to shoot these before picking them up. Some parts of the scenery can be shot to allow passage, to destroy computer parts or gain access to items, although it may not be immediately obvious which sections can be destroyed. Ten keys need to be found to open the front door in addition to other keys which can be used to gain access to the other areas.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "2012", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Andrew Foord", "publishers": "", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151110-plan-b\n"}
