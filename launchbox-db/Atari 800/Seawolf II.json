{"altername_name": [], "name": "Seawolf II", "overview": "Seawolf II was released only as a package game along with \"Gun Fight\". Both are adaptations of older Bally/Midway arcade games to the Atari 8-bit. The arcade version was known as \"Sea Wolf II\" but for the Atari was renamed \"Seawolf II\". The player(s) take submarines at the bottom of the screen, which can fire one vertical torpedo at a time and must wait for the it to complete its path before firing another. A limited number of torpodos can be loaded at one time, after they are depleted they reload with some delay. The objective is to shoot ships or enemy subs at the top of the screen, while avoiding the intervening minefield. Ships are worth different points depending on their speed and difficult to hit.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Epyx", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_Wolf_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/145007-seawolf-ii\n"}
