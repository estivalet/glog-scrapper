{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dragon", "overview": "Published in Compute! Magazine issue 039 in August 1983. You are a hungry fire-breathing dragon trying to catch some lunch. You're also fighting time as you chase assorted foods up and down ladders and across corridors. Using a joystick to control the pursuit of your wily prey, you must breathe fire to consume the apples, pretzels, and other delights by pressing your fire button. But be careful. The feast moves around randomly to avoid the stream of fire. You are allotted 60 seconds, and if you eat something your score is the amount of time left. If you do this within 60 seconds, you start over but only with 55 seconds and so on down to 10 seconds. If you make a catch within the final 10 seconds, you're back to 60 again. As a warning, the border will change colors when only 5 seconds remain. If you fail to make your catch in the allotted time, the game ends with an option to play again. Also, \"Dragon\" records the high score.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "August 1, 1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Steven R.
