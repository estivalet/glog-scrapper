{"altername_name": [], "name": "Colony 7", "overview": "A war has broken out and pirates threaten to steal the food supplies of your colony. The colony has been supplied with three Armoured Defence Vehicles (A.D.V.s) that have the role of protecting it from the two large pirate space stations in orbit. Gameplay is a classic fixed screen shooter and consists of moving the A.D.V along the bottom of the screen, shooting at pirate raiders and avoiding their projectiles. Raiders can swoop down and snatch food from your stockpile. If all the food is depleted, a life is lost.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "System 3 Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/145121-colony-7\n"}
