{"altername_name": [], "name": "Action Adventures", "overview": "Action Adventures is a set of three compiled BASIC games: 1) Climber, a Crazy Climber style game, 2) G*Man, a Q*Bert style game, 3) Diamond Dig, which resembles Dig Dug or Mr. Do! Each is fairly primitive for the Atari and are actually relabeled versions of previous games known as Squish'em!, Hookey!, and Diamond Mine. Since no credit is given is seems likely this package was an unlicensed distribution of previous games.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Keypunch Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/149684-action-adventures\n"}
