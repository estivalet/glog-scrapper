{"altername_name": [], "name": "Adebar", "overview": "In Adebar you control a stork who flies left to right on a scrolling screen. You can use the joystick up to flap your wings (which raises or lowers you on the screen against the variable wind pushing you) and the button to stick out your talons (then push up to dive).
