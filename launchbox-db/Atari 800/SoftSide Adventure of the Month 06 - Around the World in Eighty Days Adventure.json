{"altername_name": ["Around the World Adventure", "Around the World in Eighty Days Adventure"], "name": "SoftSide Adventure of the Month 06: Around the World in Eighty Days Adventure", "overview": "Around the World in Eighty Days Adventure is the sixth in a series of monthly text adventures for multiple systems. The player tries to complete the feat of recently successful Phileas Fogg, by also traveling around the world in eighty days using available technologies of the time. The player starts in London, and takes a hot air balloon ride to Barcelona, Spain. From there, they explore the desert, and take a yacht to Marseilles, France. In Marseilles, the player must outsmart punks, and take the train to Italy. In Italy, the player must scare a fat woman with a mouse to take a steamship to Bombay, India. While attempting to take a train across India, the player becomes stuck in the jungle, and must befriend some elephants to travel across the subcontinent. While traversing the jungle, the player rescues an Indian princess, and arrives in Ahmadabad, India, and then takes a train to Calcutta. The player just barely makes a steamship to San Francisco, and travels across North America, getting some help from Tinkerbell along the way. The player ultimately arrives in London with one day to spare. All commands are via 2-word VERB NOUN entries, and game play contains several object puzzles. There is no save or restore feature.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "SoftSide Publications", "publishers": "SoftSide Publications", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/368952-softside-adventure-of-the-month-06-around-the-world-in-eighty-days-adventure\n"}
