{"altername_name": [], "name": "Star Raiders", "overview": "As the pilot of an interstellar starship, your mission is to destroy all enemy spacecraft on the galactic chart and prevent them from destroying your starbases. There are three different types of fighters roaming throughout the galaxy; cruisers, fighters, and basestars. With the help of your galactic map, you can find the sectors of the galaxy where these fighters are located and then warp there to destroy them. When all of the fighters in a sector are destroyed, you can warp to a new location for the next battle. Be sure to keep an eye on your starship's energy level; warping to new locations, being hit by enemy fire, or colliding with an asteroid will drain your energy. If you completely run out of energy, your starship will be destroyed, however you can warp back to a starbase to refuel at any time. Returning to a starbase will also repair other types of damage your starship can receive, such as faulty engines, loss of your shields, and faulty photon torpedoes. When all of the enemy ships have been destroyed, you win the game and receive a rank.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1979", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atari", "publishers": "Atari", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.82", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Raiders", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_VDM8nC9sM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/32484-star-raiders\n"}
