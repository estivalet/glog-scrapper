The Olympics, in the year 2000, feature a new event - the first designed to test the athlete's mine. A robot is placed deep inside a maze and relays visual information to a computer in front of the athlete. With the aid of a 3-D view on the screen in front of him or her, the athlete must guide the robot through the maze as fast as possible. The event is called Captivity. The player attempts, from a 1st person perspective, to escape a randomly generated 26 x 15 maze. There are 20 methods of maze generation. The player can move forwards, backwards, left, and right.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Craig Patchett", "publishers": "PDI", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/144625-captivity\n"}
