{"altername_name": [], "name": "Roderic", "overview": "Godart the evil wizard has kidnapped the beautiful princess Fiscella. The valiant prince Roderic, knowing that Godart's keep is virtually impossible to infiltrate by an intruder, proposed himself as a hostage in exchange for Fiscella. Godart agreed, counting on a large ransom. Yet he forgot about young Roderic's knowledge of magic. A few spells and magical herbs, and Godart was gone for good. Now Roderic is alone in Godart's castle - and he needs to get out. Roderic is a platform adventure game, where you have to collect items scattered throughout the castle to use them in solving puzzles elsewhere. You can carry up to 3 items at a time. With them, you can open blocked passages or avoid sudden death. There are some situations in the game which can kill you - falling chandeliers and rooms filled with deadly traps, to name a few. The castle has three levels (1st floor, basement, roof), between which you can move with an elevator.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Mirage Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/370157-roderic\n"}
