{"altername_name": [], "name": "Beach Landing", "overview": "Beach Landing is a World War II themed arcade game. The player controls a landing raft on D-Day during World War II, as they try to land Allied soldiers on the French beaches near Normandy. On the first screen, the player loads troops from a large landing vessel floating out in deeper waters. All the while, Nazi artillery bombardment threatens to sink the landing vessel. The player must choose their landing location, and travel to the bottom of the screen. On the second screen, the player encounters a zoomed portion of their landing area. They must avoid mines, Nazi artillery fire from the coast, and other defensive structures, to drive their watercraft up to the shore in order to unload troops. When the troop land, they will plant an American flag on the beaches. The player must then return to their original location, and load more men to a different location along the beach. The player gains points for each successful landing. The player starts with 5 watercraft, and when all are lost it's game over.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Optimum Resource, Inc.", "publishers": "Weekly Reader Family Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lz1hS1QewmM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73938-beach-landing\n"}
