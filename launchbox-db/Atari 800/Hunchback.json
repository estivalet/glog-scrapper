{"altername_name": ["Hunch Back"], "name": "Hunchback", "overview": "Hunchback was a game that ported to several platforms based on the arcade game of 1983. The Atari version was built in prototype but never officially released. Help Quasimodo dodge fireballs and arrows while leaping over pits and pikemen, sometimes with the help of a swinging bell-pull rope, in hopes of rescuing his beloved Esmeralda from the top tower, all the while being slowly chased across the castle parapets by an invincible knight in full armour. Once you get the hang of any individual obstacle, the game starts throwing them at you in tandem, until toward the end you're tracking the swing of the rope, the thrust of the lance, the approach of the arrow and the advance of the knight all simultaneously.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Steven Macilwee", "publishers": "Ocean Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunchback_%28video_game%29", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/150487-hunchback\n"}
