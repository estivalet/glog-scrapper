{"altername_name": [], "name": "Preppie! II", "overview": "Preppie II features the continuing adventures of Wadsworth Overcash. Up and coming prepester Wadsworth thought he had it all, until an initiation stunt gone wrong left him in trouble with the top fraternity on campus. After barely escaping his banishment retrieving balls from a golf course of hellish design in Preppie!, Wadsworth must now compete in a new challenge to advance to the next level of fraternity consideration. Wadsworth is armed with a cloak which makes him invulnerable to enemy attack for a a limited period of time each level. Each level of difficulty consists of 3 rooms separated by a doorway. The goal is to walk over all areas of the map to turn them purple. When all squares are colored in all 3 rooms, the player advances to the next level. Room 1 and 3 features frogs which continuously try to hop towards the player. They can be avoided by using spinning doors to block the frogs' path. The 2nd room features several horizontal passageways, from which lawnmowers continuously scroll from the left or the right. The player must use interconnecting pathways to avoid this danger. Between levels, players are treated to a brief intermission involving an alligator. After each level, the dangers move at a faster rate. The player has a total of 3 lives, and if all are lost, it's game over.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Russ Westmore", "publishers": "Adventure International", "genres": "", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/144857-preppie-ii\n"}
