{"altername_name": [], "name": "Space War", "overview": "Space War for the Atari 8-bit systems is a variant of the classic mainframe game of dueling spaceships. The two opponents fly around a sun, trying to destroy each other with their guns. Controls follow the Newtonian model established in the original Spacewar!: once accelerated with the thruster, the ship will follow on its course until the thruster is fired in a different direction. Several options can be toggled: the point limit can be set to 10, 21 or none. The sun in the center of the game can be set to exert positive, negative or no gravity on the players' ships, and the gravitational force can be set in five levels from very weak to very strong. The playfield can be set to either wrap around or to have the ships bouncing off its boundaries, and the maximum speed of the ships can be set in four different levels.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Antic Software", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148143-space-war\n"}
