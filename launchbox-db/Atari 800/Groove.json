{"altername_name": [], "name": "Groove", "overview": "The objective of the game is to hit the little creature at the bottom of the screen. To do that, you need to dig through the terrain between you by shooting it, which will destroy some, but it gradually grows back over time. Ships will be launched at you that will kill you by touch, but can be destroyed with your shots (which awards no score points). There is a spawner of the ships that cannot be destroyed that kills you with touch, as well as a walking enemy that looks like a MULE (or AT-AT from Star Wars) that freezes when you hit it but cannot be destroyed.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Frank T.
