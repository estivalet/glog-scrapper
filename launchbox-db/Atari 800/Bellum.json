{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bellum", "overview": "Bellum is a 1-player side-scrolling space shooter for the 8-bit Atari. Why has the dauntless Monty Gillespie-Smith volunteered for yet another hazardous mission? He's answering his Empire's call in its time of need! His vital mission is to deliver a cargo of India tea to the officer's club. He must navigate futuristic landscapes in his trust biplane, Geraldine. The player controls a small biplane, which can move vertically, as well as accelerate and decelerate. The ship has the ability to fire directly forwards and drop bombs. The player tries to clear six stages of futuristic alien landscape, while avoiding rockets, laser fields, asteroids, and other environmental dangers. The player has limited fuel, and must shot fuel depots to recharge during longer missions. The player starts with five lives, and if all are lost it's game over. The game borrows heavily from the 1981 arcade games Scramble and Super Cobra.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Adam Michael Billyard", "publishers": "APX", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5bbAsl3VJ8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/144914-bellum\n"}
