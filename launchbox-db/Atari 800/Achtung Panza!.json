{"altername_name": [], "name": "Achtung Panza!", "overview": "Achtung Panza! is an up to three way tank combat game, viewed from a top down perspective. Moving the joystick left/right rotates the gun of your tank, pushing forward will turn the tank to face where the gun is pointed then move. All three tanks share a field with plenty of obstacles that will absorb shots as you try to shoot the other tanks. There is unlimited ammo but each tank has a finite health and can only take so many hits.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "2004", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Maciej Dubicki", "publishers": "Sente Software Group", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "3", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/160834-achtung-panza\n"}
