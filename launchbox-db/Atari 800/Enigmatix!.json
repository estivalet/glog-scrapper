{"altername_name": [], "name": "Enigmatix!", "overview": "Enigmatrix! is a platform and puzzle game. You play as a bouncing ball; you keep bouncing when you hold down the fire button, when you let off you slowly lose your bounce. There are various blocks on the platforms that will change based on you bouncing on them; some will release blocks elsewhere, some can do up and down, some are destroyed when you touch them, etc. Sometimes actions are different from bouncing on a block versus \"resting\" on it without a bounce. The objective is to manipulate the blocks so that you can make it to the exit. The game comes with a level editor that allows you to make your own custom levels and save them should you choose.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Stephen Firth", "publishers": "page 6 Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/149383-enigmatix\n"}
