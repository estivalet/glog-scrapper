{"altername_name": [], "name": "Acrobat", "overview": "Acrobat is a game developed by Peter Rizzuto and it was from volume 7, issue 2 of Compute! dated February 1985. The game is simple. Run and jump over objects and rack up points until you die. Quite possibly one of the earliest examples of an endless runner game. There is also another guy that throws arrows at you that you have to jump over as well.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Peter Rizzuto", "publishers": "COMPUTE!
