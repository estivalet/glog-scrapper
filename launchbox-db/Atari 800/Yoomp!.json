{"altername_name": [], "name": "Yoomp!", "overview": "Yoomp! is the winner of the 2007 ABBUC software competition. Like a combination of Trailblazer and an often-seen demoscene effect, you fall down a tube, landing on each square progressively in a rhythmic manner. Landing on certain tiles will have certain effects, such as making the screen quake, decreasing the brightness or forcing you to jump. Navigating the tube itself is a matter of planning ahead and compensating for your limited movement capabilities.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "2007", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Marcin \u017bukowski", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/TNxICcU3bPo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72142-yoomp\n"}
