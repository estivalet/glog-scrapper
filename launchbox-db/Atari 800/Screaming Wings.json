{"altername_name": [], "name": "Screaming Wings", "overview": "A top-down vertically scrolling shoot \u2018em up with a World War 2 feel resembling 1942. You pilot your aeroplane through 9 levels of forests, fields and oceans. You\u2019ll be facing hordes of enemy planes and their bullets, contact with which costs you one of your 3 lives. You can dart slightly off the screen to dodge bullets, similarly to SWIV. A number of power-ups are available, including a drone weapon which will shoot from the opposite position as you (for example, if you\u2019re 75% of the way across the screen, it will be 25% of the way across).", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Don Rigby", "publishers": "Red Rat Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/145458-screaming-wings\n"}
