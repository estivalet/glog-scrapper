{"altername_name": [], "name": "Strzyga", "overview": "Strzyga is an arcade game inspired by Montezuma's Revenge. The game requires being on the run constantly. Each board is haunted by three ghosts who come after just two seconds and start chasing the victim. Collecting objects (jars, masks, torches, swords, bombs) must be combined with a continuous avoidance of ghosts and numerous obstacles (spikes, snakes, cactuses, deadly plants). The main task of the game requires finding 100 jars, which allows access to the vampire guarding the treasure.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Rafa\u0142 W\u00f3jcik", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148921-strzyga\n"}
