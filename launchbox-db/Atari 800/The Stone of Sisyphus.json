This is a dungeon crawl game - equip your character, enter the dungeon, fight monsters and win treasure. Traps abound as well. Many events are random. You can save your character (assuming he survives) to use in later episodes. This episode is touted as 'a thinking man's adventure'.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Chameleon Software", "publishers": "Adventure International", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/144451-the-stone-of-sisyphus\n"}
