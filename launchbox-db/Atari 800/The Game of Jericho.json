{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Game of Jericho", "overview": "The Game of Jericho is a 1-player arcade game based upon the Battle of Jericho. The player takes the role of Joshua as the Israelites conquer the Canaanite city of Jericho. The player controls Joshua, who can move horizontally about the bottom of the screen and fires lightning bolts vertically towards the walls of Jericho. Guarding the walls are shields and Canaanite generals. In the Apple II version, the player can shoot between the shields to destroy the generals, while in the Atari version, the player must shoot between small gaps in the shields which intermittently appear. While doing this, the player must avoid Canaanite arrows which rain downwards. The player's goal is to shoot all seven pieces of wall guarded by the shields and generals, revealing the word \"Jericho\". After doing this, the player advances to a more difficult level. Intermittently a spy appears, and if they are shot, the rows of generals reappear.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Davka Corporation", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/144956-the-game-of-jericho\n"}
