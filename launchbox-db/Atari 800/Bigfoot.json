{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bigfoot", "overview": "Unrelated to similar named games on other 8bit computers. This apparently unreleased game looks like Robotron but plays somewhat like Pac-man. There is a single map randomly populated by hard points that must not be stepped on, some creatures that move about after the player, and other items that need to be picked up to complete the level. The player cannot shoot and tries to capture all the items before they are touched by one of the pursuing creatures.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dave Kosmal", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/149727-bigfoot\n"}
