{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cosmic Life", "overview": "Imagine pitting yourself against a dangerous space rival in a cosmic fight for survival. your goal is to place more thriving colonies on the surface of the planet than your opponent. But only thriving colonies stay on the surface. Others wither and die. Colonies consist of individual space pioneers who are placed on the planet by your joystick-controlled flying saucer. But the planet's environment is hostile, and pioneers must be placed in groups if they are to survive. At the same time, resources available on the planet are limited, so if too many pioneers are placed together they will starve. Occasional space storms don't make life any easier. To WIN, you must carefully nurture the growth of your colonies, while disrupting (whenever possible) the growth of your rival's space outposts. Only the fittest survive.
