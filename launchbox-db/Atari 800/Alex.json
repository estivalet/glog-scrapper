His goal is to collect all the screws on the planet needed to repair the ship and reach his flying capsule, avoiding alien forms of life and numerous traps. The players will encounter many obstacles on their way, for example chests that will have to move properly, closed doors requiring to find the key, deadly cannons or electromagnets attracting metal objects. Robbo can use the gun after finding ammunition, bombs placed on the board and travel through teleporters. Some versions even include hidden codes to get past a particularly thorny level.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Boguslaw Kornafel", "publishers": "Robo-Soft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147222-alex\n"}
