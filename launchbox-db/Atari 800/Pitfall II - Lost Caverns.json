{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pitfall II: Lost Caverns", "overview": "You play Pitfall Harry searching for the Raj diamond, his niece Rhonda, and a variety of treasures somewhere in the Andes. Poisonous frogs, eels, scorpions, bats and other hazards get in the way. Pitfall II is the sequel to Pitfall!, the original platform game. Gameplay has remained pretty much the same, with each screen presenting a side view of obstacles to get past, and potentially treasures to collect. The landscape is more maze like, with a variety of paths and dead ends to search. Along the way there are checkpoints the player will encounter. When the player dies, Pitfall Harry will be sent back to the most recently crossed checkpoint.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Activision", "publishers": "Activision", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.8", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitfall_II:_Lost_Caverns", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/0fmaus8RBRc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90867-pitfall-ii-lost-caverns\n"}
