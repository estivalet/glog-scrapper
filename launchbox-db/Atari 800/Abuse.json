{"altername_name": [], "name": "Abuse", "overview": "A revolutionary new program that gives the home computer a wicked mind of its own. ABUSE transforms one of these mild-mannered machines into a rude, slightly demented smart-aleck whose whole purpose is to exchange insults with the operator. It forces the user to talk to it, responds creatively to whatever the user types in, and in the process comes up with potentially millions of unexpected new curses and obnoxious suggestions. ABUSE has special, ingenious ways to thwart the experienced operator, but can just as easily mistreat someone new to computing, even someone who has never seen a computer before. ABUSE is a real milestone in home software technology - the first program that fills people's widespread need to say what they really think. ABUSE is a text parser similar to Eliza (but specializing in insults).", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bob Martin", "publishers": "MMG Micro Software", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109364-abuse\n"}
