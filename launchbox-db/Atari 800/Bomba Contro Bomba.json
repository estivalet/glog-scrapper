{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bomba Contro Bomba", "overview": "Bomba Contro Bomba is an unauthorized re-release in Italy of a game called Chain Reaction! from Compute magazine. The objective is to eliminate all of your opponent's bombs from the 5x6 grid. Players alternate placing one bomb each turn. If a placed bomb has enough bombs adjacent to it, it will explode and this can cause a chain reaction, taking out other bombs that are surrounded in turn.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Doriano Benaglia", "publishers": "LindaSoft", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162328-bomba-contro-bomba\n"}
