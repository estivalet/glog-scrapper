{"altername_name": [], "name": "Marbled", "overview": "Marbled was first place in the 2011 ABBUC software contest. It is a puzzle game in which the objective is to move a marble to the exit square on the board. You can move the marble one square by placing the cursor on it, pushing and holding the button, then moving the stick in the direction you want the marble to move. There are squares on the board that will interact with the marble in certain ways; such as a directional arrow that will cause the marble to move in that direction as soon as it enters the square with the arrow. Others have various effects such as teleporting the marble, providing bonus points, or even immediately killing the marble. You can exchange two squares on the board (before the marble has touched them) by highlighting one, pressing fire, then highlighting the one to be exchanged and pressing fire. The puzzle is how to move through the maze while avoiding traps or dead ends by exchanging when possible.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "2011", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Marik Pavl\u00edk", "publishers": "ABBUC", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/150721-marbled\n"}
