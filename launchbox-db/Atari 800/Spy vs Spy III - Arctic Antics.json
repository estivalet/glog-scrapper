{"altername_name": ["Spy vs Spy: Arctic Antics"], "name": "Spy vs Spy III: Arctic Antics", "overview": "The third and final installment (after Spy vs. Spy and Spy vs. Spy: The Island Caper) sees the spies on an iceberg. They're seeking items (gyroscope, fuel canister, key card) and then seeking to leave via a rocket-ship before a blizzard sets in. New trap items include a saw (for cutting holes in ice), a plunger detonator (with dynamite), an ice pick and snowshoes. There are some pitfalls (thin ice and snow drifts). Hand-to-hand combat is done with snowballs. Watch your spy's body heat or he'll become a permanent resident.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "May 1, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "First Star Software", "publishers": "Databyte", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/144463-spy-vs-spy-iii-arctic-antics\n"}
