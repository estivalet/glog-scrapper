{"altername_name": ["Fire One!"], "name": "Fire One", "overview": "The horizon is filled with enemy battleships, destroyers, PT boats and more, all steaming toward your home port. Your fleet is the only thing that stands between them and their final destination. This isn't just any fleet you're facing, it's their biggest, commanded by their most experienced Admiral. You have the ships and fire power to match them boat for boat, and you're commanding the fastest submarine on or under the seven seas. However, it's going to take more than fire power to win this battle, your battle plan better be right on target. This could be the biggest battle of the Pacific Campaign, for the loser it will be the last! This game appears to have never been released stand alone, but rather as part of a compilation.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Epyx", "publishers": "Epyx", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/145052-fire-one\n"}
