{"altername_name": [], "name": "Space Eggs", "overview": "Space Eggs is a fixed screen shoot 'em up that is quite similar to Space Invaders and Phoenix, games where aliens inch down the screen in waves to attack the player's tank. In Space Eggs, instead of firing shells, the player shoots eggs which when destroyed releases monsters, space wolves, giant-bomb-throwing lips, and the most dangerous of all, killer fuzz balls. The killer fuzz balls bounce and shake and move towards the player with frantic inevitability.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dan Thompson", "publishers": "Sirius Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Eggs", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/144290-space-eggs\n"}
