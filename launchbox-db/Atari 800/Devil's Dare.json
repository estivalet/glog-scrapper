I hired a marketing representative and she made me change the name to Devil's Dare and add the refund your money if you beat the game deal. She marketed that unsuccessfully, sold maybe fifty copies total by mail and at trade shows. Both of these versions were written in assembly language and distributed on both diskette and cassette. I think there may have been some copy protection on the diskette. I ended up refunding only four or five purchases because they were able to beat the game as the offer required\".", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "John Golini", "publishers": "Jay Gee Programming", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148879-devils-dare\n"}
