{"altername_name": [], "name": "Arkanoid", "overview": "Arkanoid (\u30a2\u30eb\u30ab\u30ce\u30a4\u30c9, Arukanoido) is an arcade game developed by Taito in 1986. It expanded upon Atari's Breakout games of the 1970s by adding power-ups, different types of bricks, a variety of level layouts, and visual layering and depth. The title refers to a doomed \"mothership\" from which the player's ship, the Vaus, escapes. Arkanoid revived the Breakout concept, resulting in many clones and similar games for home computers, even over a decade later.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Taito", "publishers": "Imagine Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.08", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkanoid", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkKkyDjpWX8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/108193-arkanoid\n"}
