{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tagalon", "overview": "Tagalon is an action arcade game. The player's task is to find the largest possible number of jewels and a key to the castle. The search takes place around the castle and its courtyard. The seeker encounters on his way other knights, peasants and skeletons. The player can find a variety of items, such as a bomb, shield or extra energy. But the greatest skill is the avoidance of contact with the enemy. The player may carry only one item at the same time. Picking up a new object means loss of the old one.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Micro-Discount", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/fT16K7t02O8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72140-tagalon\n"}
