{"altername_name": ["Bank Bang!"], "name": "Bang! Bank!", "overview": "Somewhere between a shooter and a reaction game, Bang! Bank! is a clone of Bank Panic. The player takes on the role of a bank security guard of the Wild West, protecting the bank's twelve doors on each level. Three doors are visible on the screen at a time, and the player can walk right or left to reveal other doors. Customers and bandits come through the doors; bandits must be quickly shot before they do the same to you, but shooting an innocent person by accident results in losing a life. If a customer is able to enter the bank unmolested, they will deposit money; once all 12 doors have had customers deposit money through them, the next level begins.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "OUR 5oft", "publishers": "Mirage Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/132476-bang-bank\n"}
