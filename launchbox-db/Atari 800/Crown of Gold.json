{"altername_name": [], "name": "Crown of Gold", "overview": "Crown of Gold is a 1-player arcade game for the 8-bit Atari. The Great Crusades are over, and good King Richard has returned to England to reclaim his crown. Wicked Prince John has fled, leaving Nottingham Castle booby trapped with dynamite. The crown glitters by itself in the Crown Hall, protected by deadly arrows. The player starts in the castle hallway where they can enter 8 separate rooms. Seven of these rooms contain a maze, and the player must defuse 4 sticks of dynamite before the timer runs out. If the player enters the Crown Hall, they must cross the screen to reach the crown while avoiding streams of arrows shooting across the screen.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "General Masters Corporation", "publishers": "K-Tek Software", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/368720-crown-of-gold\n"}
