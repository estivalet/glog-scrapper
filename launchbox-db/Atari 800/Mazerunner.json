{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mazerunner", "overview": "An overhead maze game for one or two players created by Matt Fruinn and published in A.N.A.L.O.G. Computing Magazine issue 74 from July 1989. There are three different visibility levels. These are clear, blackout and flash. When the visibility is clear, the entire maze is visible at all times. When it's set on blackout, the maze is black and the walls are not visible. In the flash level, the maze is black except for periodic flashes of visibility, which last for a fraction of a second. In all three levels the players and monsters are always visible. The object is to maneuver your player from the top left corner of the maze to the exit located at the lower right of the maze. The game can be paused by pressing any key, and can be aborted by pressing a console key (not System Reset), except when the game has been paused. Along the right side of the screen are choices to modify the game. To change any of the values, press Option until the larger cursor is opposite the category you want to change. Then press Select, either to move the smaller cursors, changing the visibility or game variation, or to change numbers, representing speeds or number of monsters.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "July 3, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Matt Fruin", "publishers": "ANALOG Computing", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/149185-mazerunner\n"}
