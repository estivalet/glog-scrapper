{"altername_name": [], "name": "Block'em", "overview": "Block 'Em contains 3 arcade games for the 8-bit Atari computer. These three games are: - Blockade: Similar to the arcade game Tron, two players navigate an icon about a field, while they leave a progressively elongating tail. The goal is to destroy the opponent by forcing them to run through one of these tails. Game speed, number of points for victory, and block size are modifiable. - Captive Sssnake!: Move a progressively elongating and accelerating snake through a maze, and try to navigate it into the constantly moving black dot representing a hole. The player loses if they strike a wall or a snake tail. - Ghost Wall: Compete against a computer opponent which can move through walls with impunity. The goal is to survive as long as possible while both characters leave an elongating tail.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jos\u00e9 R.
