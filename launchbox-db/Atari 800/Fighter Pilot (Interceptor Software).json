{"altername_name": [], "name": "Fighter Pilot (Interceptor Software)", "overview": "The object of this game is to shoot down the various hostile planes that make their way across the screen in a series of waves, by aiming the crosshair at them planes and shooting them down using the joystick. The radar tells you what direction the planes are approaching from. You are encouraged to use a small amount of ammo, as you start each new wave with less ammo than the previous one. Five skill levels determine how fast the planes move and the amount of ammo available.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Interceptor Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/2cUTz7lo69I", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/146529-fighter-pilot-interceptor-software\n"}
