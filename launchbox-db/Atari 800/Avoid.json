{"altername_name": [], "name": "Avoid", "overview": "In avoid you control a player ship at either the bottom or top of the screen (bottom is player one, top is player 2). Player level is selected before start and a \"0\" means no player for that position. The object is to score enough points by shooting up (or down) the screen at your opponent or other spaceships. Your ship can move side to side by not vertically; going all the way either screen edge is a \"crash\" and after 5 crashes your game is over. You also only get one shot for each change of direction, although there is no limit to number of shots if you keep changing direction.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1980", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Computer Magic", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162312-avoid\n"}
