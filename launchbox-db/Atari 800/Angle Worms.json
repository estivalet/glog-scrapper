{"altername_name": [], "name": "Angle Worms", "overview": "Angle Worms is a two-player arcade game. Both players control a continuously moving and elongating worm. The two players compete on a screen with multiple obstacles to see who can grow the longest worm. If the player comes in contact with an obstacle or a piece of an elongating worm, they lose the match. The longer a player survives, the more points they get for winning that match. Each player gets a limited number of shots, which can be used to shorten a worm if they cut off their own tail. The games ends when one player reaches the predetermined score at the beginning of the match.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1980", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Stan Ockers", "publishers": "Adventure International", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147177-angle-worms\n"}
