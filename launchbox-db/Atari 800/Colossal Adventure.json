{"altername_name": ["Jewels of Darkness #1: Colossal Adventure"], "name": "Colossal Adventure", "overview": "Colossal Adventure takes its cue from the very earliest mainframe text adventures. Our hero must rescue the elves and find fifteen pieces of treasure. There are many dark areas, so lights and batteries are at a premium. Be careful of vicious dwarves, who can be killed using axes. You can carry up to four objects at a time; the useful ones include a newspaper, keys and sandwiches. The vocabulary includes saying spell names, DROPping items to stay within the carrying limit (and for other specific reasons), CATCHing a bird, and standard directions plus IN and OUT.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Level 9 Computing", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/145156-colossal-adventure\n"}
