{"altername_name": [], "name": "Guardians of the Gorn", "overview": "Guardians of the Gorn is a 1 or 2 player arcade game for the Atari 400/800. The player must rescue spaceships and aliens from the grasp of the deadly Gorn and his Guardians. The player crawls along the webs of the spider-like Guardians, while avoiding their grasp. If they catch the player, they'll be fed to the moth-like Gorn. The Gorn will intermittently appear on the screen to try eat the player. The player can destroy tendrils as they walk along them, but must be careful not to knock themselves off. After collecting all objects on the screen, the player must return to the corner of the level where they started. The player has 3 lives, and when all are lost, it's game over.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Inhome Software", "genres": "", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/144683-guardians-of-the-gorn\n"}
