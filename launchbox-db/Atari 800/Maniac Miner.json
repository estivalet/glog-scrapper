{"altername_name": [], "name": "Maniac Miner", "overview": "Maniac Miner is a 1-player side-scrolling arcade game for the Atari 8-bit system. Working deep in the dark shaft of Goldbrick Mine, you are Rocky, the Maniac Miner. You are trying to make your fortune by collecting the shiny rubies, opals, gold, and diamonds within the mine. You must try to collect these treasures as quickly as possible, while avoiding swooping bats and jumping over creeping spiders. The player starts with 6 men, and can lose a life if they contact a bat, spider, or if they jump into the ceiling. For every 5 treasures collected, a magic pole appears, allowing the player to descend one mine level. There are 9 individual levels of difficulty, and the collect is to maximize score by descending as deep as possible.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Allen Stuart King", "publishers": "Gentry Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/145058-maniac-miner\n"}
