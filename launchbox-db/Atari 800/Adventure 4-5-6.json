{"altername_name": ["Adventure Value Pack #2"], "name": "Adventure 4-5-6", "overview": "Compilation of Voodoo Castle, The Count, and Strange Odyssey. The games are text adventures, controlled through the use of written commands. These can consist of a single word, such as those used for player character movement, including north, south, east, west, up, and down. They can also take the form of simple, two-word verb/noun phrases, such as \"climb tree\". Although the game can recognize about 120 words, the parser only takes the first three letters into account. This means not only that the parser occasionally misidentifies words, but also that commands can be truncated: \"lig lam\" would be interpreted as \"light lamp.\"", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Scott Adams", "publishers": "Adventure International", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/159368-adventure-4-5-6\n"}
