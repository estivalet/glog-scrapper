{"altername_name": ["Galactic Saga II: Galactic Trader"], "name": "Galactic Trader", "overview": "Galactic Trader is the sequel to Galactic Empire and the second game in the Galactic Saga. The planet Galactica's forces have conquered the Central Galactic System, but with the new empire now established and at peace, the fleet commander responsible for the campaign finds himself without a job. Left with only a small personal ship, some fuel and a few credits, a career change from conqueror to trader is in order. Profits are made by transferring cargo from one planet to another - the farther away a commodity is sold from its source, the more profit is to be made. Keeping with the absence of faster-than-light travel or communication established in Galactic Empire, it is impossible to know what a commodity goes for on a certain planet unless it is visited. While the ship computer keeps track of prices, these might be out of date when a planet is revisited. The prices follow a dynamic economic model of supply and demand. Bartering is also necessary on most planets, since only on Galactica cargo can be converted to credits. The game goal thus necessitates visits to Galactica from time to time, but this harbors another risk: the new emperor, jealous of the former fleet commander's popularity, might attempt to assassinate him. Each visit to Galactica increases the chance of an untimely death.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Br\u00f8derbund Software", "publishers": "Adventure International", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/146724-galactic-trader\n"}
