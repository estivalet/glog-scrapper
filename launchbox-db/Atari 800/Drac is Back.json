{"altername_name": [], "name": "Drac is Back", "overview": "You have decided to venture into Dracula's castle in search of treasure. The halls are infested with vampires, werewolves and monsters, and your aim is to survive the beasties and accumulate as much gold as possible in this text based dungeon crawler. While visiting rooms, other effects may occur. Sometimes a demon will steal some or all of your money unless you kill it first. For this reason, it is a good idea to leave most of your money in the bank at the shop. Also, Igor will sometimes appear and steal your holy cross, making you more vulnerable to vampires. A map of all of the visited rooms is available, but it only shows the direction of your last exit from that room instead of showing all available exits.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Syncro", "publishers": "Syncro", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147985-drac-is-back\n"}
