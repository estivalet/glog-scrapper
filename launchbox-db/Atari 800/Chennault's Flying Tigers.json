{"altername_name": [], "name": "Chennault's Flying Tigers", "overview": "In Chennault\u2019s Flying Tigers your mission is to protect the Chinese from Japanese bombers as flight lead with the legendary Flying Tigers stationed at Kunming, China. You are equipped with Curtiss P-40C aircraft that are heavily armed and faster than your Japanese opponents. The Japanese fighters are much more maneuverable and can climb faster than your Curtiss P-40C. Your main targets are the Japanese bombers which are flimsy and flammable. The player controls the interception of inbound Japanese formations using keyboard commands. Once in close range of the enemy, the player uses a joystick to line up attacks on individual planes in the Japanese formations. Each engaged plane is either damaged, shot down or escapes which the computer then computes kill probabilities of the other pilots in your flight.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "4D Interactive Systems", "publishers": "Discovery Games", "genres": "Flight Simulator", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/166169-chennaults-flying-tigers\n"}
