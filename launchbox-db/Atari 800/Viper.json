{"altername_name": [], "name": "Viper", "overview": "Viper isn't a game for the nervous. Things are happening all the time. It could drive you crazy. On the floral planet of L'ryana, the dense, lush jungle is teeming with killer vipers. You, chief leader of the exterminating force of the Star Federation, must kill all the vipers with your special neutrino beam blaster. But the vipers aren't all you'll have to worry about. The planet of L'ryana is a deadly place. There are poison mushrooms and flowers to worry about, as well as vicious bugs. And to top it off there's the special creature that moves in three dimensions. He's called the Evil Evan and he's dangerous. If he comes near you - you're finished. Viper is a one- player game of skill and performance under pressure. With high resolution graphics, and arcade action, it'll keep you busy for a long, long time... if you survive.
