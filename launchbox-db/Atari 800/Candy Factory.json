{"altername_name": [], "name": "Candy Factory", "overview": "In Candy Factory you play as a piece of round candy that must bounce his way to progressively higher rooms in a candy factory. Rooms consist of individual platforms and ladders, and the player must climb to the top of each room to the ladder which leads to the next level. There are bonus candies that can be picked up, but they are not necessary for reaching the next level. There is a bonus counter in the top right of the screen that continuously ticks downwards. The player starts with 5 lives, and if the timer reaches 0, the player will lose a life. The player must avoid threats including: floating faces, smashers, and bricks falling from higher up in the factory. If the player falls from any height, even 1 pixel, they will lose a life. After ascending 9 rooms, the player will reach the top of the building, where they must catch a balloon and float to safety. They will then restart at the beginning of an identical tower with palette swapped floor tiles.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Eric Knopp", "publishers": "Gebelli Software Inc.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOyF88hyRHo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/116724-candy-factory\n"}
