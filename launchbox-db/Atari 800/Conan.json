{"altername_name": ["Conan: Hall of Volta"], "name": "Conan", "overview": "Conan is a side-view action-platform game with seven levels to conquer. Game play consists of combat with enemies (via thrown \"power swords\" that Conan carries), and avoiding various traps and pitfalls by leaping/vaulting through levels. The character is unusually well animated for games of the time. There is no save game facility. The Atari 800 version, like the C64, was a straight forward port of the Apple II version which came first. The Atari version features substantially improved music from the Apple original.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Datasoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.88", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conan:_Hall_of_Volta", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/108223-conan\n"}
