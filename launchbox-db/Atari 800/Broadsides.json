{"altername_name": [], "name": "Broadsides", "overview": "Broadsides is a tactical simulation of ship-to-ship combat between sailing ships of the Napoleonic era (late 18th and early 19th Century). The game can be played as two different games. The first game is an arcade mode where you can sail right into the action, set your course, maneuver, and fire your guns as fast as your crew can load. For authenticity and historical detail, the tactical game puts you on the quarterdeck where you will make all the decisions real captains had to make.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Strategic Simulations", "publishers": "Strategic Simulations", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadsides_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/J92AcVxnbqk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72094-broadsides\n"}
