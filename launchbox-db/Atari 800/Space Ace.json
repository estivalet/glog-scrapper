{"altername_name": [], "name": "Space Ace", "overview": "Not related to the well Don Bluth animation game. In this game you operate a spaceship from a top down view. The screen scrolls from top to bottom, and you are in an asteroid field which you have to either dodge or shoot to avoid. At random intervals hostile ships of various types will come on screen, some of which can also be shot. Getting hit by an asteroid or an alien ship costs you a life.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Greg Young", "publishers": "London Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/144691-space-ace\n"}
