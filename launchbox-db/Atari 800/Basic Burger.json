{"altername_name": [], "name": "Basic Burger", "overview": "Basic Burger is a clone of BurgerTime. It was coded entirely in BASIC by David H. Butler and published as a type-in by ANALOG Computing in the 85/05 issue of ANALOG magazine. Game description: You have opened a new restaurant called Basic Burger. However, jealous competitors have contaminated your food. Your three chefs must assemble Basic Burgers while avoiding contaminated food. The contaminated food moves faster than your chef, but can be killed by falling burger parts or flying peppers (your trigger). Your pepper shaker contains only five flying peppers. To renew them, you must catch the bouncing pepper shaker which occasionally travels through the maze. Assembling burgers, killing contaminated food and collecting bouncing money earns points. For each 10000 points, you earn a new chef. The contaminated food comes in from the sides. By listening to their entering sound, you can tell which side the food will enter from. At the start of each round, a random maze is generated with up and down ladders. The speed of all players increases from rounds 1 to 7.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "David H.
