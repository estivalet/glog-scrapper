{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dog Daze", "overview": "Dog Daze is a 2-player arcade game for the 8-bit Atari computer. Two dogs appear n the screen, each controlled by a different player. Fire hydrants appear on the screen, and the first player to reach the hydrant makes it that color. Immediately a new hydrant then appears on the screen. On the top of the screen is a counter, and for every successfully tagged hydrant, it moves towards that player. The first person to take control of the counter is the winner. If the player runs into a hydrant previously tagged by an opponent, they also lose a point, until the screen is almost filled by tagged hydrants. Each player can throw a bone, and if hits an untagged hydrant, the player gains the point. If the bone misses, it needs to be collected before it can be thrown again. At the end of a timed section, a car will begin to come across the screen, and if a dog is hit, it's game over.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Gray Chang", "publishers": "APX", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147187-dog-daze\n"}
