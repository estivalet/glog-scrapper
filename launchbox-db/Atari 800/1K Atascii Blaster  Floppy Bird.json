{"altername_name": [], "name": "1K Atascii Blaster/ Floppy Bird", "overview": "1K Atascii Blaster is so named because it a) is less than 1K of code and b) uses the Atascii (\"ATari ASCII\") character set. It is a side scrolling shooter where you control a ship with the joystick, and can fire to destroy atascii letters in your way, or dodge them as they scroll to the left. Floppy Bird is similar to the famous Flappy Bird phone game; you control a bird who flies on screens scrolling right to left, and most both keep yourself aloft and dodge the barriers that appear at the top/bottom of the screen.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "2016", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Frederik Holst", "publishers": "ABBUC", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/160359-1k-atascii-blaster-floppy-bird\n"}
