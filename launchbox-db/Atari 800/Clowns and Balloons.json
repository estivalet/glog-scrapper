{"altername_name": ["Clowns & Balloons"], "name": "Clowns and Balloons", "overview": "Clowns and Balloons is similar to the 1977 Exidy arcade game \"Circus\", but more advanced in graphics and sound. In the game you control two clowns holding a trampoline, and use it to bounce a third clown in the air where balloons cross above. Popped balloons add up the score, and if the clown falls without hitting the trampoline he dies. There is a physics to controlling the angle and speed of the bouncing clown, much like Breakout or Arkanoid style games. Action can be very fast and the screen is colorful, with many sprits in motion. The music is also exceptionally smooth and catchy.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Frank Cohen", "publishers": "Datasoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ty2CpeSM-yA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/116654-clowns-and-balloons\n"}
