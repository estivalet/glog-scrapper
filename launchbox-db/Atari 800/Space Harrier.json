{"altername_name": [], "name": "Space Harrier", "overview": "Space Harrier is a homebrew conversion of the 16bit game to Atari 8-bit series. It is widely recognized for its capture of the gameplay of the original and stretching the Atari hardware to its limits with fast action 3D perspective, digitized sound, and colorful presentation. Like the arcade game, it is a fast-paced rail shooter game played in a third-person perspective behind the protagonist, set in a surreal world composed of brightly colored landscapes adorned with checkerboard-style grounds and stationary objects such as trees or stone pillars.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "2018", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Chris Hutt", "publishers": "", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1Oi3zgpGu8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151280-space-harrier\n"}
