{"altername_name": [], "name": "Starfire", "overview": "Came packaged in a double games pack that contained arcade conversions of Star Fire and Fire One. Star Fire is a 1st person shooter where you are in control of a space ship and you have to destroy as many fighters as possible before your fuel runs out. The fighters come flying towards you firing fireballs and with your laser sight you can fire lasers at them back. If your ship detects a fighter then a lock-on target appears and you can move your ship to move the sight onto the fighter. Once locked on your laser will shoot and destroy it. As you are fighting a timer representing your fuel counts down but certain amounts of points adds more fuel. When your fuel is empty it is game over.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Epyx", "publishers": "Epyx", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Fire", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WevxUuQRSMo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/145006-starfire\n"}
