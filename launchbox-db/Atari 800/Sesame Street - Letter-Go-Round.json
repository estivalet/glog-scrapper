{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sesame Street: Letter-Go-Round", "overview": "The Sesame Street Muppets invite a child player for a spin on the Letter-Go-Round!. By catching and matching letters on a spinning ferris wheel, children practice recognizing and matching letters, simple spelling and word formation. There are several types of game: * Upper case matching; * Lower case matching; * Mixed case matching; * One little word; * What's missing?; * Spell the secret word. At the start of each game, one of Muppet pets brings out a letter to match or word to spell and drops it on the seesaw. A letter appears on each ferris wheel bucket and as the Letter-Go-Round spins, child player should find the right letter to match or complete a word. Child may choose and try any letter, because there is no time limit to play. When a match is made or a word is completed, Muppet pets will dance and cheer a child player to the next round of play. The game is recommended for 1 player aged 3 to 4.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "CCW, Inc.", "publishers": "CBS Software", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/369849-sesame-street-letter-go-round\n"}
