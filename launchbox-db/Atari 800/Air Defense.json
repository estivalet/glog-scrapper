{"altername_name": [], "name": "Air Defense", "overview": "From Compute! April 1983, a Missile Defense type game. The object of the game of \"Air Defense\" is to defend your land (at the bottom of the screen) from falling bombs. The bombs appear at various places at the top of the screen. As they fall, the player must line up the crosshair of his gunsight and fire when the bomb and crosshair are aligned. Press SPACE to fire. The player gets only one shot, and timing is critical. After 20 bombs have appeared, the game ends, and the player is given a score showing hits and misses and a point score. One of the unique features of the game is the increasing difficulty factor: as the player improves his skill, the crosshair is gradually moved toward the top of the screen, and quicker reflexes and improved technique are required to destroy the falling bombs. As a reward for increasing skill, the player earns higher point values for successive hits. In addition, the player receives a higher score the sooner the falling bomb is destroyed.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Charles Brannon", "publishers": "COMPUTE!
