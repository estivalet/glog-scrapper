{"altername_name": [], "name": "Computer War", "overview": "It's thermonuclear war! Break the computer code to launch your missiles, then guide your interceptors before enemy missiles converge with your cities. This is a game in two parts. The first part plays a lot like a sliding block puzzle. You are given a figure in a 3 x 3 grid to match. Using the joystick and fire button, you rotate pieces in a larger grid to try to match the smaller figure. If you do that, you can select a missile launch site. Eventually, the enemy will launch its own missiles. You position your cross-hair at the radar dot for the enemy missile, and can then launch an interceptor. This part of the game is more action-oriented as you \"fly\" your interceptor to take down the enemy nuke.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Thorn EMI", "publishers": "Thorn EMI", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZE6FzK61758", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/117537-computer-war\n"}
