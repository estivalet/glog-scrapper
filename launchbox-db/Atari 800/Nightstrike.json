{"altername_name": ["Night Strike", "Night Strike!"], "name": "Nightstrike", "overview": "An electric hush falls over the gathering darkness of evening only to be suddenly shattered by the scream of sirens. The enemy, in a last desperate offense, has targeted population centers for saturation bombing attacks. The defense of the city rests solely upon your mobile anti-aircraft tank units. As unit commander, you must direct and position your ranks to destroy incoming enemy bombers while avoiding low-level bombers and rocket bombs, which seek to destroy your defense positions. The player controls a small tank that moves horizontally on the bottom of the screen. The player can fire vertically, or 45 degrees to the left or right. Planes fly in from the sides, and drop bombs on the nearby city. As the nearby city takes damage, buildings in the background begin to crumble. The tank is armed with an unlimited supply of 20 mm anti-aircraft rounds, but also has a limited supply of flak shells and flares. Flak shells explode over a large area, taking out a large radius of enemy vessels. Flares must be fired to detect enemy bombs on higher levels, as they fade into the darkness. The player starts with 3 tanks, and it's game over when all are lost.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Solitare Group", "publishers": "TG Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/146569-nightstrike\n"}
