You discover a leak in the cooling tower, and are tasked with maintaining a safe level in the tower to prevent a nuclear disaster. You do this by carrying buckets of water from a sink at the bottom of a series of platforms and ladders, and dumping them into the top of the tower. Mutant radioactive mice crawl from both sides of the maze, and the player must jump over them. The player receives bonus point for jumping over a mouse and each bucket filled into the tower. There are 4 skill levels.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Stephen Romejko", "publishers": "APX", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VS80mlLhC8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/144645-melt-down\n"}
