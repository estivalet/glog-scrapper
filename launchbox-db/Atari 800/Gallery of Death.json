{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gallery of Death", "overview": "Gallery of Death is a carnival shooting game where the targets shoot back! You control a gun that moves back and forth across the bottom of the screen. Rows of targets scroll past, and you have to shoot them, and amass the highest possible score. You will lose a life if you are shot by a target, or if you run out of bullets. Losing all three lives ends the game. The scoring system is a little complicated. Objects further away are worth more than closer objects. Red targets are worth less than yellow or green. And the different objects also require a different number of shots to take down, with targets in the second row taking 3 shots per hit. Targets in the final row will replenish your bullet supply by 1 to 4 shots depending on its colour.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "George A.
