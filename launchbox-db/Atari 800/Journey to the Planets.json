To do this, you need to collect various treasures from several unexplored worlds. Sometimes you will need to shoot your way to a particular treasure; other times, you will need to solve a set of puzzles to reach your goal. Once you recover all the treasures, you must pilot your starship through uncharted space with a limited amount of fuel and find your home planet.
