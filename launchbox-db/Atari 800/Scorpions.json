{"altername_name": ["Scorpions v2.0", "Scorpions!"], "name": "Scorpions", "overview": "Scorpions! is a puzzle game in which your objective is to arrange a number of scorpions you begin the match with on top of glowing points on the screen. When you move the stick, all scorpions on screen will move in unison (e.g., up and they will all take one step up) unless blocked by a wall. Around the screen will also be squares of lava; pushing a scorpion into one of these will kill it and end the screen. The puzzle is arranging your movements against walls until you are in a formation that can step all scorpions simultaneously on glowing points, on various moves blocking one or more scorpions from moving, and thus changing their configuration. It is very easy to get in a non-winnable configuration and sometimes takes several subsequent moves to realize that. An updated version changes the title from Scorpions! to Scorpions v2.0, but does not change gameplay. It has improved graphics and different/more maps.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "2006", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Krzysztof Dudek", "publishers": "XXL", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=_9n8Peodl6M", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151259-scorpions\n"}
