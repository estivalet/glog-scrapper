{"altername_name": [], "name": "DungeonLords", "overview": "DungeonLords was printed in ANALOG Magazine issue 67. The game involves you controlling a character in a randomly generated dungeon, with the objective of rescuing as many prisoners as possible. To do this you will have to find your way through the maze of a dungeon, picking up keys (you can only carry one at a time) to unlock doors, and avoiding or fighting the snakes, birds and demons. Monsters do not shoot and will enter the dungeon when a teleporter is glowing red. You get only 1 point for killing a monster, but 1000 for either finishing a level or rescuing a prisoner, plus 100 points for each treasure you collect.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Brian Bradley", "publishers": "ANALOG Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/150059-dungeonlords\n"}
