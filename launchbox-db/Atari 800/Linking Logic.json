{"altername_name": [], "name": "Linking Logic", "overview": "Linking Logic is an educational game meant to improve children's logical reasoning and planning skills. The aim of the game is to guide one of two children (Buddy or Betty) through the five floors of a building, from the top to the bottom. This is done by flying a bird who can place various objects (bridges, springs, walls and ladders) along the path. These are needed to prevent the child from falling through holes or changing its direction. Once the objects have been placed the game can be started and the child will start walking. As they walk a button has to be pressed as they pass patterned tiles. Those tiles will then be placed in spaces on the bottom floor. If a tile is missing when the child reaches the bottom floor the game is lost.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Frieda Lekkerkerker", "publishers": "Fisher-Price", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/WGuUN8-msNU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/146567-linking-logic\n"}
