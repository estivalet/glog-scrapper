{"altername_name": [], "name": "Fire & Flood", "overview": "Fire & Flood is a 1-player arcade game for the 8-bit Atari. The house on the cliff is burning! People are trapped! Minutes after the devastating eruption of Mount St. Helen, as storms rage and floods engulf the lowlands, the player must maneuver their helicopter through flying debris toward a daring rescue. The player must rescue as many victims as possible before the rushing water covers the launch pad. The player's helicopter moves in all directions, and the player must navigate to the burning house and return to the launch pad. Each successful return awards points. Falling debris deflects the helicopter, making it hard to navigate.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "General Masters Corporation", "publishers": "K-Tek Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/368798-fire-flood\n"}
