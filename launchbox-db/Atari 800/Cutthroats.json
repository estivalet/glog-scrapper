Various characters about the port help or hinder the player in their quest to retrieve treasure from the shipwrecks. The game randomly picks between two possible ships the objective of the adventure at run time. In addition to this unique characteristic, many of the characters in the game move about the map with a specific schedule, causing replays to vary based on what time other characters or situations are encountered.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jerry Wolper", "publishers": "Infocom", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutthroats_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/116669-cutthroats\n"}
