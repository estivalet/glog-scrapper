{"altername_name": ["S.A.G.A. No. 02: Pirate Adventure"], "name": "Scott Adams' Graphic Adventure #2: Pirate Adventure", "overview": "This is the enhanced version of the original all-text Scott Adams Adventure, Pirate Adventure. Additions to the original game include illustrations for each location, and support for the VOTRAX voice synthesizer. Otherwise the game remains essentially the same as the original. In this adventure, you shuffle between three locales: an unremarkable (at first) London flat and two islands littered with dangerous critters and people. The goal of the game is to find the two pirate treasures on the treasure island. You move about and use objects by typing one or two word commands such as NORTH, INVENTORY, or GET SNEAKERS. You only have to type the first 3 letters of a command or object for the parser to recognize it.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Scott Adams", "publishers": "Adventure International", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_Adventure", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148915-scott-adams-graphic-adventure-2-pirate-adventure\n"}
