{"altername_name": [], "name": "Orc Attack", "overview": "Orc Attack: You Against the Hordes is a side-view single screen game where you must move along the top of your castle wall to protect the castle from hordes of Orcs. You move left or right and movement is like you are on ice where you must compensate for your inertia to stop in the correct position. At the bottom of the screen are the Orcs and they move into a position with a ladder and climb up some of the way. Other Orcs will then place their ladder on top of that ladder to get higher. To defend the castle against the Orcs you have to drop rocks on they heads and you must go to either side of the screen where a rock icon is and then you must find a gap in the battlements to drop the rock and kill the Orcs. If there is no gap over any Orcs then you can remove the Battlement by repeatedly hitting it.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Thorn EMI", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orc_Attack", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/AOhOkDPD68s", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86093-orc-attack\n"}
