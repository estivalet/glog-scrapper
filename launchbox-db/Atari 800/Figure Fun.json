{"altername_name": [], "name": "Figure Fun", "overview": "Two educational games to teach multiplication, division and number series. FIZZBUZZ is a computer version of the old parlour game where players call out Fizz or Buzz each time a number comes up that is divisible by the agreed Fizz or Buzz numbers. THE TRAIN GAME is a test to see how many numeric series you can solve in a certain time. A train steams through the mountains and off the side of the screen. When it reappears it is pulling several cars with numbers on the side, but the last one is empty. This is the car you have to fill before the train can move again.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "A.
