{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gwobby Strikes Back!", "overview": "Gwobby has returned from rescuing Mrs G from the evil clutches of Emperor Nyorb, and everything seems fine. But one day the Nyorbcraft hovers over Dorple, and the renowned burgular Blue Cat drops down and steals Gwobby in his sleep, and takes him back to Nyorb\u2019s base in Cave Cwaddilor. To escape from each chamber, Gwobby has to harbour the power of the Cwaddilor rings, but Blue Cat and Nyorb do whatever they can to stop him escaping, including Nyorb and his henchman the Drogs filling the cave with crazy hazards and contraptions which make the rings harder to reach!
