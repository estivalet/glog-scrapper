{"altername_name": [], "name": "Businessman", "overview": "Businessman is a simple trading game, developed in Poland. Starting with $1,000 and a debt of $30,000 (which rises at an exorbitant rate of 26% every turn), you need to buy and sell six different cargoes (tea, opium, tobacco, cannons, matches, and cotton) in five different ports (Bangkok, Singapore, Madras, Calcutta, and Manila). After buying and selling the cargo, you can travel to another port (each trip results in your debt increasing with interest); the prices in various ports fall and rise quite randomly. Your ultimate goal is to pay off the entire debt. During travel, there is a chance of a storm that destroys half of your current cargo. At any time, you can visit your creditor to repay or borrow some money.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/166143-businessman\n"}
