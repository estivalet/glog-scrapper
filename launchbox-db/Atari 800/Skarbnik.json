{"altername_name": [], "name": "Skarbnik", "overview": "Skarbnik (Treasurer) is a puzzle game where your goal is to arrange gems (which come in various types) into specific designs. The design you have to make is on the right of the screen, and your current arrangement of gems is on the left. By clicking on a gem here, you turn it - and all the gems around it - into another type of gem. After a few such changes, the gem disappears and all the ones above it fall down. Initially, the puzzles are quite easy, but later they get harder. The game is divided into a few levels, each of them having a number of puzzles, which are presented to you in random order.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "ASF", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/146898-skarbnik\n"}
