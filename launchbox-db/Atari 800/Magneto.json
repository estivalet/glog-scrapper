{"altername_name": [], "name": "Magneto", "overview": "Magneto is a game that's sort of a combination of Pong and Breakout. Pong because you don't have to break bricks like in breakout, but also Breakout because you play the game from a vertical perspective. Unlike Pong, however, there is no AI opponent. Rather you have to hit the ball off the top of the screen as often as you can without losing all your paddles. The game was developed and released by Aim Software. The year of release is unknown as of right now, however.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Aim Software", "publishers": "Aim Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/155555-magneto\n"}
