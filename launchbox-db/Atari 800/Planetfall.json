{"altername_name": [], "name": "Planetfall", "overview": "Planetfall is a science fiction interactive fiction computer game written by Steve Meretzky, and the eighth title published by Infocom in 1983. Like most Infocom games, thanks to the portable Z-machine, it was released for several platforms simultaneously. Although Planetfall was Meretzky's first title, it proved one of his most popular works and a best-seller for Infocom; it was one of five top-selling titles to be re-released in Solid Gold versions including in-game hints. Planetfall utilizes the Z-machine originally developed for the Zork franchise and was added as a bonus to the \"Zork Anthology\". As the player, you are an Ensign 7th Class of the Stellar Patrol, who soon finds himself marooned with only a robot companion \"Floyd\". You need to overcome various hostile conditions on the planet to return yourself to safety.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Steve Meretzky", "publishers": "Infocom", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetfall", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLYKS-acIiM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/111786-planetfall\n"}
