{"altername_name": [], "name": "Space Binvaders", "overview": "Space Binvaders was 1st place in the ABBUC software contest of 2009. You control an a ship at the bottom of the screen. Scrolling down to you are various 8 bit values, expressed in binary 1's and 0's. Your job is to flip a value to 0xFF (11111111) by shooting bits from gun. When a bit hits a position in the binary number, it will always flip it to the other value (logical not). Once a value is fully 0xFF it will scroll down quickly off the screen (and you must dodge it).", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "2009", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Radek Sterba", "publishers": "ABBUC", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151279-space-binvaders\n"}
