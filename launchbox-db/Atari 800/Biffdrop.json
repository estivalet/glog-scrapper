{"altername_name": [], "name": "Biffdrop", "overview": "THE STORY SO FAR Two weeks ago a flock of sea gulls had flown to the Icked Medfly Museum and stole a valuable ring. They're holding the ring for ransom at the infamous Gulls' Grotto. Slyvester Biffdrop, Inspector of Mysterious Mishaps for Icked Industries, is assigned to recover the ring. He's now at the entrance to Gulls' Grotto. GULLS' GROTTO One mile south of Balogna Beach is one of the world's most dreaded areas-Gulls' Grotto. Few have returned from this extremely dangerous series of caves. Here is a list of some items said to be found in the Grotto: Gruesome Gulls - They fly throughout Gulls' Grotto. Their touch is deadly to Sly. Eggs - The gulls have laid numerous eggs throughout the Grotto. Sly must kick an egg (touch it with his webbed foot) to dispose of it. Doors - Doors lead to other rooms in the Grotto. A door opens only when Sly has destroyed all the eggs in a room. Lasers - These turn on and off intermittently. One zap and it's goodbye Sly. Spikes - Sly's experience in \"Escape From Epsilon\" has taught him that spikes are very sharp, and are deadly if fallen upon. Ladders - Sly can climb up ladders, but not down (a hereditary phobia). Jelly Cubes - Sly can walk and fall through these, but you can't see Sly when he's in one. Hard Cubes - These look like Jelly Cubes, but Sly cannot penetrate them. Hard Cubes and Jelly Cubes are usually mixed together, so you must help Sly find his way through the mazes of cubes (counting footsteps sometimes helps). The Ring - The ring is in the last room (room eight) of Gulls' Grotto. Touch the ring, and you (and Sly) have won! HINTS Get to know Sly - test his limits to see just how much he can do. Sly is a duck and has wings, so he can fly to a limited extent while in midair. Practice controlling his jumps and falls. When you come to a new room, position Sly in a safe spot and figure out a strategy for that room.
