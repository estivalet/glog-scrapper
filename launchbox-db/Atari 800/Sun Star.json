{"altername_name": ["Solar Star"], "name": "Sun Star", "overview": "Early in the 21st century the Xxarion Star Corporation placed its first solar energy grid in orbit around the sun. The grid utilized the suns energy to create special energy crystals that allowed travel through space at the speed of light. It was not long before a total of sixteen energy grids were in orbit around the suns of the star systems throughout the galaxy. Unfortunately, now at the dawn of the 22nd century, due to build up of unstable disruptive energy pulses, it has become impossible for normal supply craft to collect the energy crystals from any of the orbital grids. To recover as many crystals from the grids as possible, a supply craft has been totally redesigned, giving it awesome speed and extraordinary fire-power. This craft is called the Sun Star. You have been chosen to fly it.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Glenn G.
