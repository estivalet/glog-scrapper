{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ants in Your Pants", "overview": "Benny has gone out for a day in the Country. He is tastefully dressed in his favourite pair of Pink Striped Bermuda Shorts. Unfortunately there is a particularly Vicious colony of ants in the field where he is taking a Picnic and the sight of Benny's Shorts drives them Mad. The only way Benny can stop them is to stamp on them before they can reach the centre where they will stand on each other until they can invade Benny's Bermudas. Unfortunately the more ants Benny squashes, the madder they get and the faster they run. The red ants are the most difficult to kill.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Allan Knopp", "publishers": "Atari Explorer", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYPO7yyYD_w", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/163531-ants-in-your-pants\n"}
