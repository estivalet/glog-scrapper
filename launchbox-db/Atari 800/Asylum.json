{"altername_name": [], "name": "Asylum", "overview": "The story takes place in a labyrinthine asylum. One rather confusing feature of that labyrinth is that some sections of it seem to exist in several places at once. So an item dropped in a certain place will also show up in another place of the labyrinth, in a corridor of the same shape (but different orientation), and vice versa. This game was technically a sequel to a game called Asylum on the TRS-80 and as a booter game for MS-DOS, however since the original game was only released on those two platforms, the sequel was called Asylum II on those systems, but just called Asylum on every other conversion.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Michael O.
