{"altername_name": [], "name": "Syn Boga Wiatru", "overview": "Syn Boga Wiatru (Son of the Wind God) is a platform game, set in Inca cities and temples. The player is a professor who, on each of the game's four levels, is trying to find a priceless amphora. Jumping around and climbing ladders and ropes feature heavily. The main threats, apart from steep drops, are various enemies that walk around; falling a long distance or contact with an enemy drains the professor's health. Running out of health ends the game immediately. The professor has two thrown weapons: rocks and knives, both of which kill enemies instantly. There is limited ammunition, and rocks have the additional demerit of being affected by gravity over long distances. Ammo can be replenished by collecting diamond-like pickups. There are also keys, used to open locked doors (each key is one-use, so it's necessary to decide which doors to open and which to leave alone). Finally, the player can find cups that replenish health.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Rafa\u0142 W\u00f3jcik", "publishers": "L.K.
