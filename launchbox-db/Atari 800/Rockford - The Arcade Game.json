{"altername_name": ["Rockford"], "name": "Rockford: The Arcade Game", "overview": "Rockford is based on the arcade game of the same name, which was originally developed on a Commodore Amiga. Interestingly the arcade game copies the approach of gameplay from Boulder Dash, a game developed for the...Atari 8bit. The game has four difficulty levels, with 80 screens. The player must collect the designated amount of treasure items before he could leave the area and proceed to the next level. Every world features 4 levels, making it 20 levels altogether. The player dies if a stone or a treasure item falls onto him, collides or touches an enemy (even brushing against is enough for the kill), or runs out of time. The player must also watch out not to get himself or the exit locked. The player can kill enemies to break through walls and to obtain the desired amount of treasures. There are several special characters and contraptions to assist the player, such as faucets, clocks, plasma walls and worm-like creatures.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Icon Design", "publishers": "M.A.D.
