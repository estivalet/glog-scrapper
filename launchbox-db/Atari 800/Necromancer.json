{"altername_name": [], "name": "Necromancer", "overview": "Tetragorn the Necromancer has a fleet of evil beings at his disposal, from spiders to ogres and Hammerfists. You play Illuminar the wizard, aiming to use the forces of light and nature to triumph over dark. There are three stages of play to this action game. Standing constantly in the centre of the screen, you must use your long-range Wisp weapon to create an army of them, while also fending off Ogres. Venom Spiders infect your trees - to prevent them from withering away, you must first kill the Spider, then hit the tree with your wisp. Eye-Pods (did Steve Jobs play this game?) can be hit to produce even more seeds.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bill Williams", "publishers": "Atari", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.62", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necromancer_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/Lnc3vI0fgJA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72124-necromancer\n"}
