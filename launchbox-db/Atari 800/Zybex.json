{"altername_name": [], "name": "Zybex", "overview": "The player takes the role of two convicts, Rinser and Cassalana, escaping from an execution in intergalactic prison. To buy their freedom, the convicts must collect tokens to open later levels by destroying the big end of level bosses. There are 16 levels, with a choice of \"open\" levels when one is completed. First level, Arcturus, is always the first level to be played. The last level is called Zybex. Two players can play simultaneously in all versions. When playing, firing is automatic, with the fire button switching weapons. Two players can play simultaneously, an unusual feature for the time.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Brian Jobling", "publishers": "Zeppelin Games", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.6", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zybex", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IQBY9WhQKA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/108474-zybex\n"}
