{"altername_name": [], "name": "Meteor", "overview": "Meteor is a simple game of dodging a screen-covering meteor shower that moves from right to left on your screen. You can maneuver your ship in any direction with the stick as you attempt to dodge the oncoming swarm. Because of how dense the playfield is, Meteor feels more like a racing game than a space one, with you constantly dodging to find lanes among the rocks.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Russell Payne", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/150738-meteor\n"}
