{"altername_name": [], "name": "Android", "overview": "Android is a platform game, set in a space base filled with hostile robots; the player controls a remote-controlled android, out to gather spare parts for a computer. The player must explore the game world and search every nook and cranny for the parts; apart from jumping, the android can crouch. Climbing ladders is a little awkward, as the player has to jump from step to step. Enemy robots deplete the android's health when they touch or shoot him; the android is armed with a gun, but ammo is limited, and enemies come back to life when the screen is visited again. Ammo and health can be refilled by finding appropriate pick-ups scattered throughout the base. Falling from a large distance also depletes health. The game can be switched between colored and black-and-white mode at any point.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "January 1, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "1Button", "publishers": "K-Soft", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/23446-android\n"}
