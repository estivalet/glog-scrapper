The trouble is: you will be unable to find the asteroid without a flight plan. This early adventure game is very short, and, in order to accomplish the task, the game requires you to enter one- or two-word commands to perform various actions. The game may be saved to a floppy disk at any point in the game.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1980", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "On-Line Systems", "publishers": "On-Line Systems", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_Asteroid", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/146478-hi-res-adventure-0-mission-asteroid\n"}
