{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ghost!", "overview": "Although it looks like an arcade game, Ghost! is closer to puzzle gameplay. The screen is populated by various nodes that have arrows, some graveyard decorations (tombstones etc) and two ghosts. You as the player control a cursor that moves from arrow to arrow. When you place fire it changes the direction of an arrow, when a ghost hits an arrow they will move in the direction it indicates, and also flip the arrow randomly. And finally if a ghost lands on an arrow where the player has the cursor, the ghost will pause until the cursor is moved. The objective is to get both ghosts off the playing field through the one available exit, by manipulating arrows until that is the path the take. You lose a life if the two ghosts collide.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "David Manginelli", "publishers": "Action Software", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/149234-ghost\n"}
