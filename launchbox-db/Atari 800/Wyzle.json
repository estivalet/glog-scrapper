{"altername_name": [], "name": "Wyzle", "overview": "Wyzle was distributed via the Atari Program Exchange. The game mixes various aspects of side-scrolling shooters (mostly Defender and Scramble); you pilot a spacecraft, which you have to control with the joystick for direction (although there is gravity to fight that will pull the ship down). You can shoot to either side or drop a bomb based on the direction you're pushing the stick when you press fire. Shots from side to side go in a straight line; bombs inherit the movement of your ship, so they can be \"thrown\" by building a high sideways speed then pushing down to drop them.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "David Buehler", "publishers": "APX", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148145-wyzle\n"}
