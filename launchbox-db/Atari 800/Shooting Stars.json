{"altername_name": ["Stars"], "name": "Shooting Stars", "overview": "A single player, action avoid-it game created by Dennis Fox and published in A.N.A.L.O.G. Computing Magazine issue 16 in February 1984. Shooting Stars is an assembly-language game that strands you on an asteroid with almost zero gravity. Red-hot particles of space debris are bouncing all around you. Death is virtually certain in this hostile environment. The question is, how long can you survive? Your objective is to avoid contact with the \"shooting stars\" for as long as possible. You are represented by a little astronaut figure, which can be moved around the screen with a joystick plugged into port #1. You begin the game with five lives. The number of lives remaining is displayed in the top part of the screen, along with a clock which shows how long you have survived. An extra life is awarded at the 3minute mark, and another at the 5-minute mark. A bell will signal the earning of an extra life. The longer you remain alive, the faster the flying particles will move.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "February 1, 1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dennis Fox", "publishers": "ANALOG Computing", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148605-shooting-stars\n"}
