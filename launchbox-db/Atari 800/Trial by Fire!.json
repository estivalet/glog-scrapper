{"altername_name": [], "name": "Trial by Fire!", "overview": "A catch-it style game by Greg Knauss of Magnum Opus and published in A.N.A.L.O.G. Computing Magazine - Issue 69 - 1989/02. When the game first starts, you should see a buOding at the right of the screen with fire coming out of the second-story window, the back end of an ambulance at the right, and two firemen in the middle. A baby should be bouncing on their net for no very good reason. The baby will now bounce off the net again. Push the joystick to the right. One more bounce and the baby will safely land in the ambulance. (Yes, I realize the improbability of an ambulance with a sunroof, but if it didn't have one, there wouldn't be a game. So there.) Soon another baby will jump from the window. This continues until the number of babies you have saved is equal to the present level times three. When this happens the level is increased and you must then rescue a number of babies equal to that level times three.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Magnum Opus", "publishers": "ANALOG Computing", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/368811-trial-by-fire\n"}
