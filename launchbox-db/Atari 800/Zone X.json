{"altername_name": [], "name": "Zone X", "overview": "The age of technology makes its demands, nuclear energy opens new horizons, but more and more plutonium waste is constantly generated, how can it be made safe? Government storage tanks are full so they've resorted to unused mine shafts. But mankind breeds its own subversives, bent on destruction who attempt to seize plutonium from one such shaft. The theft went badly wrong leaving this awesome material scattered around emitting its deadly radiation. Someone must put their life at risk before this tragic disaster becomes an awful reality. As ever things aren't quite that simple. Your radiation suit has a limited time resistance and your endeavors are hindered by the automaton robot guards and self operating laser doors that no one has been able to disable since the catastrophe broke out. Guard yourself carefully in this underground maze, the future of mankind, at peace and at war rests on your shoulders.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Derek Johnston", "publishers": "Gremlin Graphics Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=in_dcchsSPU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/145257-zone-x\n"}
