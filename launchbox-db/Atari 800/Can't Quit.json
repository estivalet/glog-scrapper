{"altername_name": [], "name": "Can't Quit", "overview": "Can't Quit is a 1 - 2 player gambling game for the 8-bit Atari computer. The goal of this game is to move your playing piece from the left to the right on 3 or 4 rows of the game board. The game board is designed in a hexagon with rows numbered 2 to 12. Rows 2 and 12 have 5 spaces, rows 3 and 11 have 7 spaces, all the way to row 7 which has 15 spaces. The player rolls 4 dice, and the player can chose whichever 2 rows contains a sum of 2 of the dice rolled. Depending on the rows chosen, the playing pieces will march one space to the right, or 2 spaces if a double is chosen. On the first rolls, the player chooses the 3 or 4 rows that will be their goal to move a piece all the way to the right. The player can chose to quit after any roll, and forfeit the next turns to their opponent. If the player rolls a dice combination that does not allow them to progress on their chosen rows, then that player loses all progress during their recent turns. The goal is to take a number of spaces, but not to be too greedy and lose all progress. The first player to march across their 3 or 4 chosen rows is the victor.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jay Trotta", "publishers": "APX", "genres": "Casino", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148147-cant-quit\n"}
