The player controls a small vessel on the bottom of the screen which can move horizontally and fire vertically. On the bottom of the screen are a limited number of power packs. A player must grab a power pack to have the energy to fire, and every shot will reduce their energy supply. A red snake-like figure will swarm about, and green bugs will break loose from this, and attempt to steal you limited power packs. If a monster grabs one of these, they can be shot, but the player must be careful not to be hit my the falling pack. If the player shoots the red snake, a bouncing bomb will drop at the player and threaten them. When a player has lost all power packs, it's game over.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bruce Thompson", "publishers": "Inhome Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.62", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWpNOnSpkL0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73727-alien-swarm\n"}
