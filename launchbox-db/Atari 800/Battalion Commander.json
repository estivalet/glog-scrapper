{"altername_name": [], "name": "Battalion Commander", "overview": "Battalion Commander is a real-time tactical (platoon/company level) simulation of modern warfare. The player is put in the role of a lieutenant colonel in charge of an entire armored battalion of either U.S., Soviet, or Chinese army. A combination of 5 scenarios and 40 maps of varied terrain (rivers, hills, minefields) is available, as well as infantry, tanks, APCs, artillery, assault guns, and other units. The commands are issued by pointing a spot on the map with the cursor (using the joystick) and then pressing a key combination selecting which company/platoon has to perform what action (these include fire support, smoke screen, laying bridges, digging in, etc.). A handicap can be chosen for either side to adjust difficulty.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "David Hille", "publishers": "Strategic Simulations", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.12", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73905-battalion-commander\n"}
