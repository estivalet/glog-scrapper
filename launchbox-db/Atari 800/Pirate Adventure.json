{"altername_name": ["Adventure No. 02: Pirate Adventure"], "name": "Pirate Adventure", "overview": "Published by Adventure International and the second game of the series, after Adventureland, this text-based adventure game was one of many adventure games created by Scott Adams, in this case based on his wife Alexis' ideas. The setting was inspired by the novel Treasure Island and involved a quest to retrieve Long John Silver's lost treasures. Gameplay involved moving from location to location, picking up any objects found there, and using them somewhere else to unlock puzzles. Commands took the form of verb and noun, e.g. \"Climb Tree\". The player started the game in a flat, and progressed via a bit of magic to Pirates Island. Here, the player had to build a ship to reach Treasure Island and there find two pieces of treasure. The player also had to contend with an unpredictable pirate ally; it was the first text adventure game of the Adams series in which the player shared the adventure with a second character.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Adventure International", "publishers": "Adventure International", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_Adventure", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/68244-pirate-adventure\n"}
