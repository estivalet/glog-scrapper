{"altername_name": [], "name": "Krazy Kopter", "overview": "Krazy Kopter is a basic shooter with three levels and difficult controls; you maneuver a helicopter over a ridge with bridges crossing it, you can drop one bomb at a time, and your job is to eliminate the fast moving cars on the bridges. If you miss even a single car you lose a life. When a bomb is dropped you must wait for it to cover the entire distance of the screen, so if you miss at all it can be very difficult to catch a car before it crosses.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tim Huntington", "publishers": "English Software Company", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/145005-krazy-kopter\n"}
