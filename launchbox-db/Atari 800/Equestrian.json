{"altername_name": [], "name": "Equestrian", "overview": "EQUESTRIAN is an arcade style game for all ages. Your joystick becomes a pair of reins as you maneuver your horse through a demanding cross country and steeple chase style course. The smooth action of your horse as he travels the three dimensional course assures you of a realistic and challenging session. With a choice of three horses and three courses, EQUESTRIAN is always ready for you to set a new record time. Unlike many arcade games, there's no set number of lives to use up. Once EQUESTRIAN starts, the horse can finish the entire course without any control from the joystick. Although the score is terrible, younger children can play this way. EQUESTRIAN has a unique set of three courses. Courses 1 and 2 always play the same. Course 3 however, is new each time you turn on the computer. You can play the new course over and over, or you can create a brand new course each time you play. Select a horse and plug in a set of reins. There are record times to shatter!", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Al P.
