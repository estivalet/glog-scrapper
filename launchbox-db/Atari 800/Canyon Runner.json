{"altername_name": [], "name": "Canyon Runner", "overview": "In \"Canyon Runner\" you are a pilot on a mission through a very perilous canyon. You must survive this test. The only way to do so is by maneuvering your tiny plane through the endlessly scrolling canyon. At first, it's easy. But chunks of rock and other obstacles soon get in your way as you maneuver through the canyon. Any of these could lead to the destruction of your plane. To avoid disaster, you have to avoid all the dark areas and hit all the areas marked BONUS. When you begin to think that everything is going to be fine and that you are home safe, things suddenly become difficult and you encounter a mind-boggling time warp. The time warp has enveloped part of the canyon. The pulsing colors of the time warp can easily distract you, so be careful. If you make it through this time warp, you will be faced with a narrower canyon.
