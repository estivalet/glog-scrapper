Players take turns trying to guess the results of survey questions. The first player to ring in and answer correctly can either choose to guess as many survey answers as possible, or can give the opportunity to the other team. After the guessing team has gotten 3 wrong answers, the opposing team has one opportunity to steal their points if they can guess a single further answer. The player with the most points at the end is the winner.
