It's damp and cold in this swamp, but at last you have four of the critters cornered. They are hiding in a 10 x 10 swamp, and each turn you search one location in the swamp, and are informed the distance you are from all 4 creatures. Using this information, you must try to catch all the mugwumps in 10 turns or less.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bob Polaro", "publishers": "APX", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/368684-mugwump\n"}
