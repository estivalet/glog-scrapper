{"altername_name": [], "name": "Time Pilot", "overview": "Time Pilot is a recreation of the arcade game to the Atari 8-bit line. It is not an emulation version or a direct port; the code was written from scratch put with a careful eye towards accuracy in game play and presentation, within the limits of hardware. It runs on Atari 8-bit computers and the XEGS console. There are some differences to display due to the 4:3 versus 3:4 layout, making this version have a smaller viewport, but gameplay remains the same (joystick for direction and fire for shots). The conversion is well regarded for its arcade feel in gameplay and technology achievements on the platform. The source code is available for public download.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "2018", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jaroslaw Padula", "publishers": "New Generation Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Pilot", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLrXn0m76LE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151456-time-pilot\n"}
