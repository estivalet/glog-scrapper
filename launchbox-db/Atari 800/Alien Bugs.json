Alien Bugs will spawn under the trees, hiding them briefly, and make their way towards the player. The player has to lure them into touching the pond by moving around it, since it is deadly to both the aliens and the player.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Andrew Davie", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161035-alien-bugs\n"}
