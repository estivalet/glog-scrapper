{"altername_name": [], "name": "Chromatics", "overview": "A match-three game. Sets of colored boxes fall from the top, Columns-style. You can move them left or right, and reposition the order of the falling set by pushing up on the stick (but they don't rotate, blocks are always in vertical columns). Lining up 3 or more blocks of the same color destroys them and the rest of the blocks collapse. You can set the difficulty (speed of falling) and the number of blocks required to make a match before a round. This was a bonus game that was released alongside Cultivation, which was also a puzzle game.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kemal Ezcan", "publishers": "KE-Soft", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/146283-chromatics\n"}
