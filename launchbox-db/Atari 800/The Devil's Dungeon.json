{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Devil's Dungeon", "overview": "Devil's Dungeon is an early text-based RPG for the TRS-80 that was rewritten for the Atari line of computer in \"Stimulating Simulations Second Edition\" in 1979, specifically for the brand new Atari line of home computers. Game play features an infinitely deep dungeon, where each level contains 16 rooms which randomly interconnect with each other. Input is via keyboard. The goal is to gather gold from rooms and kill monsters for experience. These can then be used to improve a character's strength and speed. Each room has a chance of containing a monster. The player and monster will take turns attacking until one is destroyed. The player receives experience for destroying monsters, and can receive gold for each room they explore. Other dangers include demons which can drain half a character's speed, and poison gasses which can drain half their strength. Battle and exploration cost a character strength and speed, and if either are lost the character dies. If the player locates room 1 on a level, they can replenish strength and speed. High scores are achieved by maximizing gold accumulation.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1980", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "C. W.
