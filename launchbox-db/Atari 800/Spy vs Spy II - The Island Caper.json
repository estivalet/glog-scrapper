{"altername_name": ["Spy vs Spy: The Island Caper"], "name": "Spy vs Spy II: The Island Caper", "overview": "A follow-up to the first Spy vs Spy game now sees the spies stranded on a desert island. This time, instead of the four items which allow you to leave for the airport, the spies must try to collect three pieces of a missile and escape from the island in a waiting submarine before a volcano erupts. There are a few pitfalls to avoid such as quicksand and sharks. There are also new traps (hidden pits, napalm, snares and a pistol) and hand-to-hand combat is done with swords instead of clubs. There are seven difficulty levels which affect how much time will elapse before the volcano erupts and the size of the playing area.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "August 1, 1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "First Star Software", "publishers": "Databyte", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spy_vs._Spy_II:_The_Island_Caper", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/144462-spy-vs-spy-ii-the-island-caper\n"}
