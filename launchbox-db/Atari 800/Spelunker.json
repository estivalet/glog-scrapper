{"altername_name": [], "name": "Spelunker", "overview": "In this game, you are a spelunker who climbs deep down mountain caves in search for treasure. The levels consist of many platforms, connected to each other by a riding cart, ladders, ropes, etc. You'll have to time your jumping well, because a slight fall will lead to your death, and the abyss is near! You should jump over various obstacles, avoid ghost-like enemies, climb on ropes, and use inventory items such as dynamite to create obstacle-destroying explosions that will bring you nearer to the desired treasure.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Micro Graphic Image", "publishers": "Br\u00f8derbund Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spelunker_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/VCwXNB24v78", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72135-spelunker\n"}
