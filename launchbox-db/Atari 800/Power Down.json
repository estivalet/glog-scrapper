{"altername_name": [], "name": "Power Down", "overview": "The task in Power Down is to infiltrate a fortress built on an asteroid by the evil Argon, inside a one-hour time limit. You have five ships, but there are many ways to lose one. Lazer beams and triangular rays toggle on and off, so require timing and planning to avoid. Argoniks patrol the area, and are fatal to the touch - however, they can work in your favour, as they activate some types of indestructible blocks on contact, changing the blocks' frames from white to red as a signal to you. Most doors are closed by default, and are activated by firing into their brown covers. They can be closed in the same way - this is a defensive tactic to block Argoniks, but make sure you are not in the way of the door as it closes. You can collect and activate shields to deflect and block various hazards - although the ultimate challenge is to complete the game without them.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Mastertronic Ltd.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/1jwH3ZAnraY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86124-power-down\n"}
