{"altername_name": ["Hardhat Willy"], "name": "Hard Hat Willy", "overview": "Hard Hat Willy is a 1-player arcade game for the Atari 400/800. Life is tough when you're only 6 inches tall, especially when you come home to find your house invaded by the Woka-wokas. Willy must stabilize his home and destroy the enemy eggs laid throughout. The player controls Willy, a small creature with a large prehensile tongue. At the beginning of each level, the player faces off against a large centipede, and the player must grab pieces with their tongue. Any sections that escape then roams through the level to harass the player as they explore their home. The player is also at danger from gnashing teeth which roam the level and environmental dangers. In each stage, the player must use their tongue to grab a hard hat from flying birds. This hat protects for 1 hit against monsters, but is also required to smash eggs through the level. There are also sections of wall which need to be stabilized by walking past them. When all walls are stabilized and eggs are smashed, the player progresses to the next level. Each level makes a slight alteration to the map, which opens up new larger areas to explore, and more wall to stabilize. The player starts with 9 lives, and when all are lost, it's game over.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bruce Thompson", "publishers": "Inhome Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/149405-hard-hat-willy\n"}
