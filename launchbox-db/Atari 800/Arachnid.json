{"altername_name": [], "name": "Arachnid", "overview": "Arachnid is a 1-player arcade game for the 8-bit Atari published in SoftSide Magazine 04/83. The player controls a highly-technical robotic spider clone, which the player must try to keep alive on a plexiglass viewing area filled with radioactive alien spiders. In order to stay alive, the player must eat fruit and other spiders that are colored brown or red, while avoiding blue and yellow colored items. Some of these items fluctuate in color. The player gains health when they eat the correct colored food, but lose health when moving, or eating the wrong colored food. Every 1000 points, the player progresses to a more difficult level, with 10 levels in total. There are 3-speed options. On higher levels, the player must avoid the green Flying Zapper, which instantly destroys the player. The highest levels contain 2 or 3 Zappers.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "John Ortiz", "publishers": "SoftSide Magazine", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/166140-arachnid\n"}
