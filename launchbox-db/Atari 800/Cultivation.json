{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cultivation", "overview": "Cultivation follows the basic formula of Puzznic. The player has to clear a level within a time limit by moving symbols of the same design left or right, taking into account possible ways in which they may fall if there is no space beneath them. When symbols of the same design come in contact with each other, they disappear. An editor for constructing levels is included.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kemal Ezcan", "publishers": "KE-Soft", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/146284-cultivation\n"}
