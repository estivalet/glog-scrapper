{"altername_name": [], "name": "Stockmarket", "overview": "Stockmarket is a 1 - 6 player metal trading game for multiple systems. Each player starts with $1000, and each player can buy or sell lead, zinc, tin, and gold. High prices are likely to go down and low prices are more likely to go up. The price of each share is set at approximately half of its maximum value at the beginning of the game. Newsflashes randomly appear, which can cause drastic changes in metal prices, and the players can gain bank interest or encounter capital gains tax. There are 4 levels of play difficulty. The game ends when one or more players have $1 million.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "George A.
