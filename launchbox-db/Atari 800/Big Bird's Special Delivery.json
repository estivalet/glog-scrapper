{"altername_name": [], "name": "Big Bird's Special Delivery", "overview": "Big Bird's Special Delivery is a pre-school computer game where the player can practise classification of objects. In a playful setting of shops, Big Bird and Little Bird work to delivery mail to one of four locations. This computer activity aims to teach children understanding of form class and function. The objects are controlled by pressing one of three keys on the computer keyboard to control Little Bird. When a round of play is completed the shops will light up after the mail is correctly delivered. If there is a mail mix-up, the shopkeepers gently point out mistakes and encourage the child to try again.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "CCW, Inc.", "publishers": "CBS Software", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvPgJ2OMCs4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/127640-big-birds-special-delivery\n"}
