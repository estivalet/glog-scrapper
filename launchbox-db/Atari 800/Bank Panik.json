{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bank Panik", "overview": "Bank Panik is a crosshair shooter for the Atari 8-bit line of computers. It is heavily inspired by the similar titled arcade game Bank Panic. The game was developed by Oliver Schmidt of Propaganda Software and published by Computer Kontakt in 1985. You are in a bank in the Midwest in the days of Jesse James. Your job is to take money from loyal bank customers and fend off any bank robbers. Right now you are standing in front of the first 3 of a total of 9 bank entrances. In the 2nd row you see the numbers 1-9, each number belongs to a door. If a dollar symbol appears next to one of the numbers during the course of the game, it means that money has been deposited at this door. To complete a level, you must try to collect money on all 9 doors. In the 3rd line there are 3 clocks which, in an emergency, count down to zero like a countdown.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Propaganda Software", "publishers": "Computer Kontakt", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164342-bank-panik\n"}
