{"altername_name": [], "name": "Galactic Avenger", "overview": "Galactic Avenger is a 1-player space-themed arcade game for the Atari 8-bit computer. In the outermost regions of the galaxy X-Zorb, there is a quadrant made up of 10 consecutive sectors. At the heart of each lies a Galactic Federation starbase. Ten stardates ago, these starbases sent out a distress signal that the dreaded Krell Empire has overrun and captured the entire quadrant. You have been selected to command the Federation's elite strike force, to free the starbases from the 5 advanced Krell starships that guard each one. The player controls a Federation battlecruiser, which can move horizontally on the bottom of the screen, and fire vertically upwards. Krell ships move horizontally, and fire towards the player. After the five defending ships are destroyed, the player must quickly use their tractor beam to capture the rapidly scrolling starbase, or the Krell will transform it into a Krell Battlestation and destroy the player. The player has 5 ships, and loses one with each hit. With 5 ships lost, it's game over.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mark Van Alstine", "publishers": "Cosmi Corporation", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po3H9u5Zu3w", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/112787-galactic-avenger\n"}
