{"altername_name": [], "name": "Battle Trek", "overview": "Battle Trek is a strategy space battle game. You are captain of the USS Ranger on combat patrol in the sector. The player must engage Vegan battleships in strategy-based space combat. A difficulty level from 1-50 is available for the player. The player must navigate to a number of star sectors using their warp engines to destroy all Vegan vessels. Within a sector, ship navigation can be automatic or manual by selecting thrust level and direction in 360 degrees. The player's ship is armed with positron lasers and a meson cannon for offense. A limited crew supply is available, and they are lost as the ship is damaged, and can not be replenished. Shields help protect the vessel and limit crew fatalities when powered. When no enemies are present, the player can launch probes to investigate the local sector. The player has the option to manually control power distribute of their vessel or allow the computer to automatically do this. The player's vessel has 4 separate shield and positron laser positions, as well slots for the meson cannons, ion engine, light engine, and batteries. The player must redistribute power to these different ship sections to optimize ship performance. The ultimate goal is to defeat all Vegan ships present in space.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Chris Frazier", "publishers": "Voyager Software", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/145902-battle-trek\n"}
