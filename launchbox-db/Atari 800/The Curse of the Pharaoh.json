{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Curse of the Pharaoh", "overview": "The Curse of the Pharaoh is a graphical adventure game. Many years ago, a lone thief defiantly entered the tomb of Pharaoh Ickabathan and stole the two rubies which had been placed as the eyes of the mummy. The thief, however, became hopelessly lost trying to escape the tomb of death, and in the process, dropped the rubies. Sightless, the mummy instinctively sprang to life and sought out the intruder, viciously slaying him on the staircase. Avenged, the mummy returned to its sarcophagus, but placed a curse upon the land until its eyes should be returned. The player must enter the pyramid, and explore in search of the two lost gemstones. These must be returned to the mummy, to lift the curse that haunts the land. All items and locations are graphically displayed on the screen. The player must type in all commands as a single word, and there are several inventory based puzzles. There is no save or restore feature.
