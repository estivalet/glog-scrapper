{"altername_name": [], "name": "Golf Challenge", "overview": "Golf Challenge is an 18-hole arcade golf simulation for the Atari. The player controls a small character, whom they can position anywhere on the field of play. The character has a single golf club, which can swing in a 360 degree arc. The power of the player's swing is based upon how far of an arc the club goes through prior to connecting with the ball, and the direction of the swing is dependent upon the angle the club connects with the ball. There are a total of 18 holes, which contain basic hazards including trees, sandtraps, and water. When the player places the ball on the green, the player enters a zoomed-in view of the putting green, but still positions and swings their club in the same manner. The game keeps track of the score through 18 holes.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Harold Schwab", "publishers": "Sierra On-Line", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_Challenge_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/wm3FvUvyZUE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/144500-golf-challenge\n"}
