{"altername_name": ["Star Maze (Sir-Tech)"], "name": "Star Maze", "overview": "There are two \"Star Maze\" games for the A8, this is the first one released and more popular (the other is an educational game from Roklan). The object of Star Maze is to collect the nine jewels in a large, randomly generated, maze-like structure. The player flies through the maze in a spaceship that looks and controls like the ship from Atari's Asteroids arcade game: one button applies thrust, the other button shoots in the direction the ship is pointing. The joystick orients the ship. A hyperspace key drops the ship in a random location in the maze, and a finite number of antimatter bombs (R key) destroy all visible enemies. Unlike Asteroids, the ship has limited fuel, and the hyperspace option uses a significant amount of it. A jewel can only be collected it the ship's speed is below a certain threshold, then the jewel can be flown to the mothership in exchange for additional fuel. Completing a maze gives a bonus based on how much time it took. There are 16 levels.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gordon Eastman", "publishers": "Sir-Tech", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Maze", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151323-star-maze\n"}
