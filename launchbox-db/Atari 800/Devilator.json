{"altername_name": [], "name": "Devilator", "overview": "The objective of Devilator is to control the boarding / off boarding of passengers on an elevator that moves between 5 floors under your control with the joystick. Passengers will pile up on the right side with a number indicating your level, you can move the elevator to them with up/down, then use left/right to pull a passenger onto the elevator or push them off to the correct floor. The passengers pile up quite fast so the challenge is whether you can keep ahead before a lane on a particular floor fills up.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Yakov Epelboim", "publishers": "Zebra", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/149922-devilator\n"}
