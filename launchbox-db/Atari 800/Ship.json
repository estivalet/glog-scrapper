{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ship", "overview": "Ship is a timed puzzle board arcade game. The player controls a constantly moving device which has to remove all the colored squares from the board and reach the exit before the time runs out. To do so, the player must touch a blot of paint, changing the color of the device, which allows him to remove squares of the same color. In addition to the time limit, the player has to watch out for moving enemies and crosses which change between red (harmless) and white (deadly). Once in a while the player may acquire bonuses appearing on the level, such as extra time, temporary ability to control the device (moves into one indicated field), temporary immortality shield. Further levels introduce a lot of board modifications, such as teleports moving the device to a different location.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Mirage Software", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148170-ship\n"}
