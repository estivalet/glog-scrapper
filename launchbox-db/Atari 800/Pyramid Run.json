{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pyramid Run", "overview": "You're the first person in over 3000 years to have successfully reached the bottom level of the Great Pyramid of the Egyptian Pharoh Cheotemkahmen, supreme ruler of the Fifth Dynasty, and the jewels and riches are yours fo collect! All that remains is to take whatever you can carry, and climb to the exit at the top of the pyramid, and safety. However, there are still one or two problems to overcome before spending your newly-found wealth. The Great Royal Court Sorcerers of the Fifth Dynasty were charged by Cheotemkahmen with the responsibility of insuring that his eternal sleep should be undisturbed. To forever allow his rest to be peaceful, they insured that the Demons of the Dark Places would be loosed on any trespasser of the hallowed corridors of the Great Pyramids, and now you've got to conquer them to reach your freedom. Monsters, lightning bolts, radio- active fire, and more, much more, lie between you and your escape. PYRAMID RUN is a race against time and the Demons of the Dark Places, set upon a scrolling view of the tunnels of the Great Pyramid. You may choose to begin at any of five levels of difficulty. Fantastic full color graphics and spectacular sound effects highlight this game, with dozens of the most hideous and original monsters in computer gaming.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ed Annunziata", "publishers": "MMG Micro Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/145227-pyramid-run\n"}
