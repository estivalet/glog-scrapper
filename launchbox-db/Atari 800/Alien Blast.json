{"altername_name": [], "name": "Alien Blast", "overview": "Alien Blast is one of the few Atari 8-bit games released that was not from Atari itself but supports the Atari light gun (included with the XEGS system, but rare elsewhere). It is a simple Space Invaders type game, except the gun is used to aim and shoot. It appears the code attempts to compensate for the offset of the \"sights\" of the gun from the barrel, but generally this just comes across as inaccurate positioning when shooting.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Richard Gore", "publishers": "Dean Garraghty Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161034-alien-blast\n"}
