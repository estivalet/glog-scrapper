{"altername_name": ["Dunjonquest: Temple of Apshai"], "name": "Temple of Apshai", "overview": "Temple of Apshai is the first in Automated Simulations' Dunjonquest series of role-playing games series and one of the first computer role-playing games. The game could be described as a graphical \"roguelike\", but actually it resembles the mainframe classic DND more, as you cannot see the whole level, but only your surroundings. Furthermore, the level maps are not randomized like in Rogue. Still, the gameplay has a lot in common with Rogue and other early dungeon crawls: A solo character explores a monster-infested, multi-level dungeon to grab some treasure, everything in top-down view.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Automated Simulations", "publishers": "Epyx", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Apshai", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/146525-temple-of-apshai\n"}
