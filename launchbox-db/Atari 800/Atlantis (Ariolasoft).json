{"altername_name": [], "name": "Atlantis (Ariolasoft)", "overview": "While cleaning a closet at the marine biological institute in Sandramar, France, Boris Larunge stumbled upon a document which he immediately forwarded to the scholar Janusz Perheszh\u00f6e in Chablis. Perheszh\u00f6e studied it carefully and realized it could be the most sensational discovery since the the beginning of the gold rush in California. He sat down with Captain Eugen Mone, expert diver Franz Gurgelha\u00df and the Spanish Consul General in Istopol. The latter, Jose Atapualga de Minelao Estrabaldi-Vacante, made the necessary preparations for an expedition under the secret name \"Lemuria.\" A few months later, a ship was found adrift near the Canary Islands - undoubtedly the expedition's ship. Whatever you may think of it, the story seems credible. Now go and dive for the treasure.
