Scale the tower, run the gauntlet of arrows and reach the pinnacle for success. In disgust, you've taken refuge in the lost mountain town of Golenden, where your host (he's the ancestor of the man who was considered to be the most important citizen of Golenden at the time of the fall of civilization \u2014 the plumber) has been most gracious. Unfortunately, you rather tactlessly referred to his daughter as \"that repulsive little squash-faced gnome,\" and now, as your punishment, you must scale the ancient Kason's Tower. At the start of the game, your man is on one side of a floor of the tower, and a pole is on the other. Use your joystick to move your man across the floor to the pole, avoiding the arrows that will be flying toward you. Pull down on the joystick to duck beneath the high arrows, and press the trigger to jump over the low arrows. When you reach the pole, your man will be teleported to the next floor. Upon the completion of the top floor, your man will begin on the next level. You're given five men at the beginning of the game, and when these are used up, the game is over.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "James Rogers", "publishers": "ANALOG Computing", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/150800-kasons-tower\n"}
