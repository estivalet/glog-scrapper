{"altername_name": [], "name": "Eckn", "overview": "Eckn was a winning game from the ABBUC Software contest of 2007. You are presented a board with four different colors of squares arranged randomly. Your task is to find examples of rectangles, identified by four corners of the rectangles being the same color (you only have to match the corners, not anything inside). The rectangle can be anywhere from 2x2 to the full size of the board. You place the cursor on a square and press the button to identify one corner of the rectangle, then find the opposite corner and repeat. Once a rectangle is identified the colors within are scrambled and you start looking for your next matching rectangle corners.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "2007", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Christian Kr\u00fcger", "publishers": "Berlin Softworks", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/150080-eckn\n"}
