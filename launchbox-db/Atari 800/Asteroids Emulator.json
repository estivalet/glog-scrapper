{"altername_name": [], "name": "Asteroids Emulator", "overview": "This is an emulated version of the 1979 Asteroids arcade game, running on an Atari 8bit computer. The original Asteroids used a 6502 processor close to identical to the Atari 8bit, and that code is run unmodified, while high level emulation attempts to replace the vector graphics drawing of the original by using the 8bit rasterized display. The result is extremely accurate in gameplay.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "2012", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Norbert Kehrer", "publishers": "", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/149702-asteroids-emulator\n"}
