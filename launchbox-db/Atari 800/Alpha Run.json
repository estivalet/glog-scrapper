{"altername_name": [], "name": "Alpha Run", "overview": "Alpha Run is a race, or chase, run over letters or numbers in sequence without exploding the bombs that also lie in the way. A simple game, it teaches the alphabet order and the number sequence 1 through 9. The little blue race car is controlled by a joystick in port One. When the car runs over a number or a letter in proper sequence, the number or letter disappears. If the car runs over a bomb, hits a wall, or touches a number out of sequence, everything explodes and the game starts over. If the sequence is completed, the bombs are rendered harmless. Run over them to end the game. Your final score equals the time elapsed during the run.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Steve Groll", "publishers": "Antic", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZr-M4fxjsI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/149248-alpha-run\n"}
