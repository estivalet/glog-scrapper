{"altername_name": [], "name": "Alien 8", "overview": "Alien 8 is a homebrew port of the game of the same name from ZX Spectrum/BBC Micro, originally by Chris and Tim Stamper, which was published by Ultimate Play The Game (the company that would eventually become RARE). On a dying planet in a distant galaxy, the last of the creatures known as the \"guardians\" stored all of their libraries, records, and knowledge on a single starship together with cryogenically preserved members of their race. A single robot, Alien 8, is tasked with keeping the occupants of the vessel alive for the duration of its journey. The ship is launched towards a new solar system and Alien 8 performs his task for thousands of years during the journey. However, as the ship nears its destination, it is attacked and boarded by hostile aliens. The cryogenic life support systems were damaged during the attack and Alien 8 must restore them to an operational status before the ship's automatic thrusting systems manoeuvre it into planetary orbit", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "2013", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Emkay", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.38", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGHWSIh-qvA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161031-alien-8\n"}
