{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bacterion! The Plague of 2369", "overview": "ANALOG Computing July 1984: The year is 2284. The \"Robotron Incident\" of 2084 has long been forgotten, and the field of genetic engineering has led to the fabrication of synthetic humans. Each fabricated unit is genetically engineered to perform a specific task to perfection. Fifty years later, through a unanimous vote of the United Nations, these \"Syntrons\" have been installed into every top political position in the world. Each represents the opinion of the particular government they were assigned. The fate of continents rests in the hands of the Syntrons. Now the year is 2369. Long-term studies of the Syntrons\u2019 behavioral patterns yield strange results. A genetically invulnerable bacteria has infected the species. The bacteria preys on the cerebral nerves responsible for all higher order brain processes, making the individual deranged and quite unstable. This bacteria has begun to trickle down to infect the Syntrons\u2019 counterpart: man. Soon, mankind will teeter on the very brink of insanity and demise, unless a means can be found to halt the plague of 2369: Bacterion!", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "ANALOG Computing", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148597-bacterion-the-plague-of-2369\n"}
