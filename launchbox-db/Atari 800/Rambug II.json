{"altername_name": [], "name": "Rambug II", "overview": "A shooter created by Dave Miller and Matthew J. W. Ratcliff and published in A.N.A.L.O.G. magazine issue 52 dated March 1987. Deep withm your Atari there are 200 bugs, ]ust waiting to fly across the data bus into the microprocessor's \"power matrix\" and crash the system Rambug 11 places two electrodes across the pulsating matrix m the form of horizontal \"charging plates\" \u2014 one above and one be low As the bugs fly across the power matrix, you must center the electrodes Qvet the little crashers [with a joystick in port 1) and annihilate them with the flash of a lightning bolt (fire button) . Your electrodes draw their power from the matrix \u2014 a limited supply \u2014 beginning each game with 2000 watts of energy. There are twenty rounds of ten bugs each to complete the game. (Yes, it's possible to finish.) Use your powerful lightning bolt sparingly to make it to the end. Your electrodes are fragile, like the filament of a light bulb. Should a bug hit one when it's not energized, the electrodes will short out and disintegrate. Fortunately, you have five of these \"debuggers.\" If a bug approaches an electrode from the side, protect yourself by pressing the fire button just before it gets there. You can also blast several bugs at a time as they cross paths within your' field of fire. If a bug successfully crosses the power matrix, he makes his way into your CPU and destroys one of your spare electrodes. If all your electrodes are destroyed, or you run out of power, then the bug's \"crash run\" was successful, and the game ends.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "March 2, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dave Miller", "publishers": "ANALOG Computing", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148962-rambug-ii\n"}
