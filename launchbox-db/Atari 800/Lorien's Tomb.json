{"altername_name": [], "name": "Lorien's Tomb", "overview": "Lorien's Tomb is a timed puzzle board game similar to Puzznic. The player's task is to remove the mysterious objects blocking the passage to further levels of the pyramid. The obstacles should be disposed of by setting two or more of the same components next to each other before the time runs out. The items can be moved only to the sides and immediately disappear upon contact with another identical element. The player can use the instantly moving (horizontally or vertically) platforms to transport the item to a different place.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "L.K.
