{"altername_name": [], "name": "Boggler", "overview": "Boggler is a board game with some resemblance to Othello/Reversi for 1 or 2 players. It was developed by Gary Braun and published as a type-in game in the March 1983 issue of COMPUTE! Magazine. In the tradition of popular board games like checkers, Boggier should offer hours of iitrigiiing strategic planning as you try to capture your opponent's pieces and avoid capture yourself. This is a simple, yet challenging, game of skill. The object of the game is to capture five pairs of your opponent's pebbles or to get five consecutive pebbles in a row, either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. In this version, the computer acts as the playing board, checking all moves for validity and keeping score for the two opposing players, who alternate turns. At the top center of the screen is a box indicating, by turning either black or white, whose turn it is. White always goes first in the center of the board. A joystick is used to position the player's pebble in the desired location, and the fire button is used to drop the pebble.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "March 1, 1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gary Braun", "publishers": "COMPUTE!
