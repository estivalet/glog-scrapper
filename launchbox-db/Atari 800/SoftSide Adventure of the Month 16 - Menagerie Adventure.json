While out on a pasture, you see strange vehicle ahead that appears to be a spaceship. As you are drawn closer, the door opens and you walk inside. Stepping inside, the door suddenly closes, and the alien vessel rapidly accelerates into space. You realize you've been captured aboard an alien zoo ship, and you are to be their newest attraction. Captured aboard the alien vessel, the player must explore the ship, and use the assistance of other alien creatures from throughout the solar system to escape your prison. Each of these creatures from different planets have unique skills which will allow the player to finally access the navigation control of the alien vessel, and reroute the vessel back to Earth, allowing their escape. All commands are via 2-word VERB NOUN entries, and game play contains several object puzzles. There is no save and restore feature.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "SoftSide Publications", "publishers": "SoftSide Magazine", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/368976-softside-adventure-of-the-month-16-menagerie-adventure\n"}
