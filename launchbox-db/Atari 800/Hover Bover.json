{"altername_name": ["Hover Bovver"], "name": "Hover Bover", "overview": "Your lawn needs mowing and your mower doesn't work. Now what? You look next door and see your neighbor's lawnmower. When he's not looking, you grab his lawnmower and start mowing your lawn. Try to avoid being caught as you mow up to 16 lawns while avoiding your flower beds. If you mow a flower bed then the gardener will arrive to try and take away the mower. Your dog can help you keep that pesky neighbor away while you finish your work. However, the dog's tolerance of the mower noise decreases over time and he may eventually end up attacking the mower.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "LLamasoft", "publishers": "LLamasoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/0xSrwz72BpM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/146540-hover-bover\n"}
