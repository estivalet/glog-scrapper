{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bootleg", "overview": "Bootleg is a 1 - 2 player arcade game for the 8-bit Atari computer. The speakeasies are counting on you! unless you can deliver the moonshine, they can't open tonight, and you've they don't like to be disappointed. The player must thread their way through city streets in their delivery wagon trying to gather different types of booze. While doing this, the player must avoid the Prohibition agent who cruises the streets. Here's faster than you, and can set up roadblocks, and will give chase if you approach too close. You can thwart his pursuit by throwing out traps and monetary bribes to slow him down temporarily. After picking up 10 drinks, the player can exit the level to the right, and enter the next city district. Intermittently, an electrical storm passes overhead and disorients the Prohibition agent. The player has limited gas, and must complete the maze quickly, picking up fuel pumps. The player starts with 5 lives, and when all are lost, it's game over. There is a total of 20 different levels.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Eric Freeman", "publishers": "APX", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IeITh6GlWI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148111-bootleg\n"}
