The player controls a timed downhill skier, who attempts to navigate a wooded track while travelling through 10 gates. The player can steer themselves left and right as they travel downhill. If the player strikes a tree or gate post, they become slowed down, and must slowly extricate themselves from the obstacle. The player loses 10 seconds for every missed gate.
