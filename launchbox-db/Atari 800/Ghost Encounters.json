{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ghost Encounters", "overview": "Ghost Encounters is a puzzle game for the 8-bit Atari. This is the sequel to Action Quest. Played from a top-down perspective, the player controls a small ghost within a haunted mansion, who is tasked with collecting a number of treasures. The ghost is armed with a small gun, which can fire in 8 directions, and can be used to defeat monsters and solve puzzles. New in this game, the ghost can further transform into useful objects, including: a shovel, a torch, a key, and can make itself thinner. Each room has a short description which might provide a hint, and the player has a limited timeframe to gather the treasure on each level before turning from white to dark and losing a life. The player starts with 10 lives, and if all are lost it's game over.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "JV Software", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/144690-ghost-encounters\n"}
