{"altername_name": [], "name": "Incoming!!", "overview": "In Incoming! you must protect your city from wave after wave of incoming helicopters and space shuttles. The helicopters drop fleets of paratroopers who attempt to land on the rooftops of your city. To land safely, a paratrooper must retain his parachute until he touches ground. The shuttles release tiny \u201cbuilding bombs\u201d that expand as they fall and build a new city block when they hit something. Shuttles and helicopters alternate waves. The only defense against all of this is one semi-stationary rapid-fire gun. The gun can shoot up to sixteen steerable rounds at a time. To aim your shots, move the joystick left or right. If you have all sixteen shots in the air at one time, the gun will light up as a warning that you can no longer shoot, until a shot goes off the screen or hits something. Each shot you take will subtract ten points from your score. The parachutes of the paratroopers can be shot off, which causes the paratrooper to plummet helplessly to the ground, destroying anyone below him. In addition, the helicopters and shuttles must be shot repeatedly to be destroyed. The more hits they take, the faster they fly, until they finally blow up. The debris from any explosion will kill surrounding objects.
