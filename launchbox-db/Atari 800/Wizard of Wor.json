{"altername_name": [], "name": "Wizard of Wor", "overview": "Wizard of Wor is an arcade shooter played from a top-down point of view. The player controls a \"Worrior\" who is trapped in a dungeon. The goal is to earn as many points as possible by shooting the numerous enemy creatures which wander about the maze like corridors. The creatures wander about at various speeds, may shoot darts at the player, and some even have the ability to disappear temporarily. At the bottom of the screen the player has a radar which can be used to locate creatures that are invisible. When the the player completes a maze, a Worluk sometimes appears. This creature moves rapidly and will only be on the screen momentarily. If the player destroys the creature before it escapes, the next dungeon will become a double score dungeon and all creatures will be worth twice as many points. Occasionally the Wizard of Wor himself may appear! He moves quickly and can teleport around the maze. If they destroy him, the player will earn a large amount of points. The game may be played by one player or two players simultaneously. The players can cooperate to better defend against the enemy hordes \u2014 but shooting the other player's Worrior grants a large score bonus, which can potentially encourage competitive play.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Joe Hellesen", "publishers": "Roklan Corporation", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizard_of_Wor", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3akTUQOp-E", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/125096-wizard-of-wor\n"}
