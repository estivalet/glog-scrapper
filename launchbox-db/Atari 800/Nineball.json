{"altername_name": [], "name": "Nineball", "overview": "Nineball is a pinball game with nine numbered bumpers. You start the game by shooting the pinball out of a cannon located at the bottom of the screen, which can be rotated before firing. After release, the pinball ricochets around the screen, and the cannon is replaced by a movable paddle. You can move this to prevent the ball from leaving the screen (ala Breakout ). Points are scored for your ball hitting the various bumpers. After all nine bumpers have been hit, a bonus obstacle appears which grants you extra points when hit. There is only one level layout, but there are four game modes. Mode one plays like standard pinball. With mode 2, you lose a ball if you touch one of the bumpers you have not already hit during the game. Mode 3 adds a black hole that alternates from one side of the board to the other and will swallow your ball on collision. Mode 4 combines modes 2 and 3. A cartridge version was announced but never released.", "platform": "Atari 800", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Syncro, Inc.", "publishers": "Zimag", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/144833-nineball\n"}
