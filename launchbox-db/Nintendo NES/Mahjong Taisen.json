{"name": "Mahjong Taisen", "overview": "Futuristic mahjong role-playing game with classic rules, where you fall in a spaceship to an unknown planet. As a result, it is populated by a completely fantastic medieval population. Shortly after the accident, you meet a guard, and he takes us to the king, who is pleased to fight us in the first Mahjong battle. The character has lives and mana that increase with the level. The mana is spent on special actions during mahjong games. During the journey, you can communicate, interact with objects and enter into different battles. If you don't want to fight, you can buy an \"escape ring\" from the stores (like many other objects).", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "May 20, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nichibutsu", "publishers": "Nichibutsu", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83651"}
