{"name": "Blobert", "overview": "Blobert is a tricky single-player platformer for the NES where you control the world instead of the player. Use \u271c to move the world and Blobert will react by, uh, blobbing. Try to get Blobert to climb through all 3 worlds so he can find his way home. On his journey, he'll encounter obstacles which react in different ways when you press \u24b6, including moving platforms, disappearing blocks, claws, fans and canons. Blobert can't die, but if he falls down you'll lose your progress.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "2021", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "", "developers": "Mystical Wheelbarrow", "publishers": "itch.io", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvXJtVDJ42E", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162979"}
