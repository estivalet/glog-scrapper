{"name": "The Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle", "overview": "Our hero Bugs Bunny needs your help on a daring quest to rescue his main squeeze, Honey Bunny - caught in the clutches of those despicable Looney Tunes characters Daffy Duck, Yosemite Sam, Sylvester and Wile E. Coyote. Sufferin' succotash! Hop from one spooky room to another, chase up creaky stairs and slide down rusty pipes. To get to Honey, remember the secret passwords, then collect all the carrots you find. But hurry! Before you can say \"What's up, doc?\" those rascals are on your cottontail. Bugs can throw a good rabbit-punch in a pinch. But for added protection, you can use some unusual objects like boxing gloves, cargo crates and water buckets. And that's not all - after a drink from the Magic Bottle nothing will stop you! With a deft wrist, a quick wit, and a swift kick, you will win the game and have Bugs and Honey hopping happily together again!", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "August 1, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kemco", "publishers": "Kemco/Seika", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.64", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=lC7FFkgtKkQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1595"}
