{"name": "CrossFire", "overview": "CrossFire is a side-scrolling run-and-gun somewhat reminiscent of Contra series, although played at a slower pace. All that is known about the plot is that you are Eric the soldier and you single-handedly fight evil all over the world, from Vietnam to Colombia. You start with your fists and grenades, but soon obtain a sub-machine gun which can be upgraded to spread shot and even to rocket launcher. The upgrades are usually located in breakable crates. Unlike most Contra games, Eric doesn't die in a single hit, but has a lifebar which is partially replenished or extended every time he picks up a weapon upgrade or a medal.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "November 2, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sanritsu Denki", "publishers": "Kyugo Trading", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.6", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/25012"}
