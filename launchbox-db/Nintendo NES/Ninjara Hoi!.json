{"name": "Ninjara Hoi!", "overview": "Ninjara Hoi! is an RPG made in the style of the more well-known Dragon Warrior, which itself spawned a number of clones back in the '80s and '90s. It's known as a bit of a humorous game in same vein as Tengai Makyou, with much of its humor centered around on various pop and historical figures of Japanese culture.<br><br>This game, along with a number of other Famicom titles by ASCII, uses an expansion plug-in for the Japanese Famicom known as a Turbo File. This Turbo File is essentially a memory card, compatible with a number of other ASCII titles at the save time to store save data from the game. Those attempting to play this game on an actual non-Japanese NES or most emulators will not be able to save their game in the traditional ways as intended by the game; you will have to leave the console on or use save-states, respectively, to retain game progress.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "August 8, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "ASCII Corporation", "publishers": "ASCII Corporation", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27478"}
