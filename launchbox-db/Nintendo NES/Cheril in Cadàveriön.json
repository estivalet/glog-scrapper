{"name": "Cheril in Cad\u00e0veri\u00f6n", "overview": "Help Cheril in the sixth game in the Cheril Trilogy! You have approximately one minute to escape each of the four floors in the mansion, each floor being composed by five closed chambers. To progress from one chamber to the next, you\u2019ll have to open the gate by means of pushing around every statue on the screen to their bases. If you get it wrong you can always restart the room by pressing \u00abfire\u00bb over the blueish tile you will find in every room with statues. This will revert the room to the original position.<br><br>You must hurry, because if the time runs out you\u2019ll have to start the current floor over. Luckily, you can collect hourglasses for some more time, but be careful with the mansion inhabitants, who are everything but friendly.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "2018", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mojon Twins", "publishers": "Mojon Twins", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133202"}
