{"name": "Tantei Jinguuji Saburou: Yokohama-kou Renzoku Satsujin Jiken", "overview": "The second game in the Jake Hunter/Tantei Jing\u016bji Sabur\u014d series, this time on a regular Famicom cartridge. A girlfriend goes missing, and the search for her reveals that she was hiding guns. Police suspect a link between the case and an underground trafficking organization.<br><br>Like other Famicom entries in the series, time plays an important role. Any action the player chooses uses a certain amount of time. Failing to solve the mystery within the allotted timeframe results in a bad ending. Commands are chosen from a set of several, like many Japanese graphical text adventure games. Because this game is on a cartridge rather than a Disk Card, progress is continued via passwords rather than save files.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "February 26, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Data East", "publishers": "Data East", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rsmI0Zt_5s", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83818"}
