{"name": "Toki no Tabibito: Time Stranger", "overview": "Toki no Tabibito: Time Stranger is an adventure game with a heavy emphasis on text commands and dialogue, similar to other NES adventure games like Portopia Serial Murder Case or Hokkaido Serial Murders: Fade to Okhotsk.<br><br>Unlike Portopia and its sequels, there is very little detective work to be done. The player simply visits important people throughout Japanese history as a time-travelling cop, answering their questions and incrementally moving forwards through time towards the present. Most of the game is depicted in a first-person mode where the other person sits across from the main character, who then asks and answers questions. There are a few third-person sequences where the player must get back inside their spaceship-like time machine before it leaves.<br><br>While there are a few branching paths depending on dialogue choices taken, the game's narrative is fairly linear.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 26, 1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Kemco", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83820"}
