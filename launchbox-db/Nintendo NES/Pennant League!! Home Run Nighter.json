{"name": "Pennant League!! Home Run Nighter", "overview": "Pennant League!!: Home Run Nighter is a Famicom baseball game in the mold of Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium: All the athletes have a cartoonish super-deformed look to them. Home Run Nighter goes one step further than its contemporaries by having every batter in the fictional teams that comprise the Pennant League their own unique sprite. Some will be taller than others, or have exaggerated facial features. It's possible that some of the athletes (and the managers, which appear during the preparation stage) are modeled on actual Japanese baseballers.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "March 31, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Data East", "publishers": "Data East", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27215"}
