{"name": "Igo: Kyuu Roban Taikyoku", "overview": "Igo: Kyuu Roban Taikyoku is an early computer adaption of the classic Chinese board game known best under the name Go. The board comes in a smaller 9x9 layout instead of the normal 19x19 layout. You can choose from playing against a computer or against another human player or watch a short tutorial which shows how to play the game. You can choose from several difficulty levels, resulting in a different handicap (the human or computer player starts with one or more stones already on the board). The game also features little ninja mascots tossing the \"stones\" on the board.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "August 11, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bullet-Proof Software", "publishers": "Bullet-Proof Software", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAoEO0o0jdg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/77869"}
