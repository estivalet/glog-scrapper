{"name": "Kaguya Hime Densetsu", "overview": "Kaguya Hime Densetsu is loosely based on \"The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter\", an ancient Japanese folktale about a girl named Kaguya that is raised on Earth, only to eventually return to her true home, the moon, as its princess. <br><br>This is a traditional Japanese adventure game. All the actions are performed by selecting commands from the menu, including moving from location to location. You view the locations from first-person perspective, but there are also parts where you navigate your character from a top-down view. Beside the usual adventure commands such as \"look\", \"take\", or \"use\" (an inventory item) there are some more original actions available under \"extras\", such as \"kiss\", \"attack\", and even \"undress\".", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 16, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Micronics", "publishers": "Victor Musical Industries", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27401"}
