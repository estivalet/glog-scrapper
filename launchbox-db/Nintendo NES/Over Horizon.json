{"name": "Over Horizon", "overview": "Over Horizon is a side-scrolling shooter in which the player has to guide a spaceship through various levels and destroy numerous enemies. The ship's weapons can be fired in tow directions and defeated enemies sometimes drop power-ups that equip the ship with different weapons and up to two options. There are three different weapons in addition to the standard shot: Laser, homing missiles and bombs.<br><br>The \"Edit Mode\" presents an unusual feature. In it, players can determine the options positions (which can be changed by pressing the A and B button simultaneously), as well as the properties of the weapons. It is, for example, possible to have the laser behave like homing missiles or the homing missiles like bombs.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "April 26, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hot-B", "publishers": "Takara", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.84", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1899"}
