{"name": "Moonfall: A Legend of Zelda Compilation", "overview": "Moonfall is a compilation album of music from the Legend of Zelda franchise coded onto a cartridge so that it is playable on the original NES console. It is a collection some of my favorite tracks, from some of my favorite titles such as Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask, Twilight Princess, Link's Awakening, Link to the Past, Minish Cap, and Windwaker. The idea was to arrange and code each track in such a way that I could put the collection onto a cartridge and play them on the original console, where it all began.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "2019", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tyler Barnes", "publishers": "Tyler Barnes", "genres": "Music", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cga55bdF4u0&feature=emb_logo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/145304"}
