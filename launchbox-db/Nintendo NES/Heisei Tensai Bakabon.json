{"name": "Heisei Tensai Bakabon", "overview": "A platformer and the second game based on the Tensai Bakabon manga about an idiot boy and his lazy and even dumber father; a sort of proto-Simpsons slice of life comedy manga. The player assumes the role of the father, usually referred to only as Bakabon's Papa, as he makes his way through various capers through 2D side-scrolling platformer stages.<br><br>The game is based on the post-1989 incarnation of the anime series, hence \"Heisei\", but is still otherwise the same series. The first game based on this license is the 1988 (thus, pre-Heisei) Tensai Bakabon for the Sega Master System. Heisei Tensai Bakabon also saw an identically-titled port/sequel for the Game Boy in 1992.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 6, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Namco", "publishers": "Namco", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.86", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=EQc9Uw8Bwy4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27217"}
