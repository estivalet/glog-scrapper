{"name": "Wrecking Crew", "overview": "This amazing Nintendo Programmable game lets you design your own building, place obstacles wherever you want them, and then blow everything to smithereens! You can play the game as designed by Nintendo, or you can be the game designer and build a different maze of barriers to tear down every time. You'll have hours of fun demolishing monsters like Gotchawrench and Eggplant Man, and blowing up a building you built yourself, in this off-the-wall demolition game!", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "June 18, 1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nintendo R&D1", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.53", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zhxbm5XqTqY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/303"}
