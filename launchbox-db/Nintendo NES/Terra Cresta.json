{"name": "Terra Cresta", "overview": "In the follow-up to Moon Cresta, a well-guarded planet is being invaded. You will have to make a succession of passes over the landscape, shooting out ground turrets and aliens. Numbered bases release power-ups when shot - these can either be used in combination or (by pressing the space bar) in Formation Mode, covering a wider range of shooting positions. Each pass over the planet ends with a boss; the third and final one with a boss who can only be killed if you are at maximum power. Death puts you back to the start of the world.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "September 27, 1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nihon Bussan", "publishers": "Vic Tokai", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.89", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7-QmRMTf2I", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/10453"}
