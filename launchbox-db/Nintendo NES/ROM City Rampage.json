{"name": "ROM City Rampage", "overview": "ROM City Rampage (Retro City Rampage) is an open-world game inspired by the Grand Theft Auto series that combines driving with fighting and shooting in a retro 8-bit style. Originally started as a homebrew NES demake of Grand Theft Auto III, it was eventually developed into a full game. The game is set in eighties and the protagonist is a mullet-styled gangster who wreaks havoc in Theftropolis city. It draws many elements from the series it was inspired by, such as the ability to hijack any car, fight on foot with melee and ranged weapons, and shake off the law when too many crimes are committed.<br><br>The main story mode consists of a number of missions that involve heists, extortion, but for instance also helping out Doc Brown from the Back to the Future movies to help repair his time travel car. The game has a quirky style and hectic pace, and is filled to the brim references to popular culture, especially movies, celebrities and other games with many cameo appearances. Next to the main mission various side missions can be taken on or the city can be explored in full at the player's leisure. During certain parts 30 challenges can be triggered where an objective needs to be completed in a short time, such as driving around a tank or getting air time shooting a bazooka. These can later be replayed as arcade challenges from the main menu. In addition there is a free roaming mode with the maximum amount of money right from the start.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Vblank Entertainment Inc.", "publishers": "Vblank Entertainment Inc.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83221"}
