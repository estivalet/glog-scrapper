{"name": "Millipede", "overview": "The gameplay of Millipede is similar to Centipede but differs mostly in enemies:<br><br>Earwig: same as the scorpion in Centipede, making mushrooms poisonous so that the millipede will charge straight to the bottom of the screen after touching them.<br>Bee: same as the flea in Centipede, dropping mushrooms in a vertical line and requiring two shots to kill.<br>Spider: same behavior as in Centipede, bouncing irregularly across the lower portion of the screen. Multiple spiders can appear at the same time on higher levels.<br>Inchworm: when hit, slows all enemies for a short period of time.<br>Beetle: crawls around the player area for a while, then climbs up and leaves the screen, turning any mushrooms it touches into indestructible flowers. When hit, everything on the screen scrolls down one row.<br>Dragonfly: drops mushrooms while zigzagging down, and can be destroyed with a single shot.<br>Mosquito: bounces off the sides of the screen as it descends. When hit, everything on the screen scrolls up one row.<br>DDT bomb (stationary): can be blown up with one shot, destroying all enemies and mushrooms within the blast radius. Whenever the mushrooms scroll down, a new bomb is added at the top of the screen. Up to four bombs can be in play at one time.<br>All flowers and poisoned/partially destroyed mushrooms revert to normal, whole mushrooms when the player loses a life.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "October 1, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atari", "publishers": "HAL", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.58", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JdTOo4FGOw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1396"}
