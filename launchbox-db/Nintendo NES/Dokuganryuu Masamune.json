The player controls Masamune Date, one of the most talented tacticians among the daimyos of the period.<br><br>The game was released around the same time as the NES versions of Hot-B's Takeda Shingen and Koei's Nobunaga's Ambition - each features a different daimyo of the same era as their main protagonist.<br><br>In the game, you play as the warring overlord, and your aim is the unification of 11 regions under one rule. While comparable to other historical simulations released around the same time, this game is a little simpler and features immediate battle scenes, a hexagonal map, and includes mini-games such as a gold mine search and horseback archery. The game keeps a light, almost humorous tone, providing updates in the game via the Namcot newspaper, which shows changes in conversation tone and the emotions of your opponents. The difficulty of the game can be set, there are eight commands, and four types of battle forces.
