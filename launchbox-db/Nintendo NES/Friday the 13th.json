{"name": "Friday the 13th", "overview": "It all takes place out at Crystal Lake. That pleasant little camp where happy children of all ages go to spend a fun-filled summer... but this summer will be different. The fun will have to wait. Jason has decided to come to camp and terror is the only game they'll be playing. Only you can stop this terror. You and your six camp counselors can prevent Jason from running wild. It's not an easy task. You must first fight your way through forests filled with man-eating wolves, caves covered with blood-sucking bats, and hordes of mindless zombies at every turn. If a friend is in danger it's up to you to help... or else you can just kiss them goodbye. Jason doesn't play favorites. He'll take anyone. Don't think that hiding in a cabin or staying adrift in a canoe will keep you safe. The only way to survive this summer is to challenge Jason, face to face, and destroy him. Don't worry that it hasn't been done before... there is always a first time (well, not always).", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "February 10, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Pack-In-Video Co., Ltd", "publishers": "LJN", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.12", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1254"}
