{"name": "America Oudan Ultra Quiz: Shijou Saidai no Tatakai", "overview": "This game has two modes: story and tournament. Tournament mode is the simpler one: you compete against seven opponents in a quiz that concerns various historical, geographical, social, and cultural aspects of United States of America. Some questions require you to choose \"yes\" or \"no\", while others present you a short list of possible answers, of which you should choose the correct one. The participants' responses are timed.<br><br>In the story mode, you can navigate the character you created (male or female) in a top-down city. Avoiding getting hit by the numerous cars in the area, you must make your way to competition halls and participate in quiz shows. More areas will be unlocked as you win the tournaments. This time, giving the correct answer is more than just quickly choosing a word. Giving an answer is presented each time with a mini-game. For example, in one of the competitions answering a question involves running through a football field and making it to the correct part of the touchdown area, which is divided into large \"yes\" and \"no\" sections.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "November 29, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Pixel", "publishers": "Tomy Corporation", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.06", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHo58C49f1w", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/26659"}
