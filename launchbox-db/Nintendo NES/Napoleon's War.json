{"name": "Napoleon's War", "overview": "Napoleon's War is a half turn-based, half real-time strategy game created by Waixing in 1998. Gameplay-wise, it's the same game as Chu Han Zheng Ba: War Between Chu and Han, since it was created on the same engine, but has completely new maps (yet less missions to play), as well as audiovisuals. In addition, it's not clear if this game is original or was ported from an already existing PC game.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "1998", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Fuzhou Waixing Computer Science & Technology", "publishers": "Fuzhou Waixing Computer Science & Technology", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcrF0BbNx18", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/104949"}
