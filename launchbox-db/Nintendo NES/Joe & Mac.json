Hungry and relaxed, Joe returns to the village... BUT WAIT! Where are all the cavewomen? And where is all the food?

With no time to lose, Joe must single-handedly rescue the beloved cavewomen... and find some dinner along the way!", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 1, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Elite Systems", "publishers": "Data East", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.46", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IUFInJOVo0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1713"}
