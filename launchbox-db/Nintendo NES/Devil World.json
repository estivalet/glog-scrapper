{"name": "Devil World", "overview": "Lost in the maze of Devil World, Tamagon the Dragon has to steer clear of the Devil, his nasty co-Devils, and his treacherous helpers, Medaman, the Fried-Eggman and Bon-Bon, and ward off their attacks by breathing fire. After each round, the maze scrolls up, down, right or left. The Devil decides the direction and points with his finger. As you guide Tamagon through the maze, you also have to avoid being sandwiched between the walls.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "October 5, 1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nintendo R&D1", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.59", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF6sUIj7kvw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/7526"}
