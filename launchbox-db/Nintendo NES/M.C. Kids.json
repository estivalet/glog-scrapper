You'll need to move pretty fast to dodge creatures like Goferit and I. Psycho, solve tricky puzzles and explore the secret levels of McDonaldland. If you're going to help the M.C.Kids track down Hamburglar, you're going to have to make some totally fresh moves of your own. Oh yeah - once you've figured out how to play this game right side up - try it upside down!", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "February 1, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Virgin Games", "publishers": "Virgin Games", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.16", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1391"}
