As the commander of a fast and powerful helicopter, you must face an intense struggle against a pair of patrolling choppers before you are allowed to turbo-boost through enemy defenses to reach the motherships. Only with fast reaction and uncanny accuracy can you defeat the motherships which launch a seemingly endless arsenal of weapons.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sachen", "publishers": "Bunch Games", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "2.7", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1849"}
