{"name": "Mega Man 3", "overview": "It's robot rebellion, and nobody's safe! Least of all, Mega Man! This time the superpowerful cyborg takes on a horde of metal maniacs who've had it with being obedient! And they use every android-annihilator ever invented to make you believe it! Mega Man goes berserk, blasting through a galaxy of mining stations in search of energy crystals. But it takes more than guts to battle the phenomenal robot masters who control these worlds. It's a wrenching job, the worst - and the best - that Mega Man's faced so far!", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "September 28, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Capcom", "publishers": "Capcom", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.41", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwZ_YwvYHo4&feature=emb_title", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/344"}
