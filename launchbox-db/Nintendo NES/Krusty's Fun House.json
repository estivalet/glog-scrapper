{"name": "Krusty's Fun House", "overview": "Hey, kids! Give a hoot! Help out your old pal Krusty the Clown! My official Krusty's Fun House is infested with rats! There are over 60 levels in this game, and they're all crawling with the little varmints! I've got my loyal cadets, Bart and Homer Simpson, to guard the rat traps, but I need you to lead the filthy rodents into those traps! Then we blow 'em up! We incinerate 'em! We laser-blast 'em! We electrocute 'em! We Krusterize the little stinkers!!! Hoo boy!<br>Did I mention the snakes, aliens and the flying pigs? Well, watch out for those riffraff! If you can't Krusterize 'em, at least avoid 'em... they're worse than the #@!*%l rats! Making Krusty's Fun House vermin-free is not a pretty task, kiddy cadets-but someone's gotta do it!", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "September 1, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Audiogenic", "publishers": "Acclaim", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.92", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/8174"}
