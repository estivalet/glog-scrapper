{"name": "Outlanders", "overview": "Outlanders is an action RPG based on the manga by Joji Manabe. Tetsuya, being just a regular guy, isn't a particularly able fighter, and at first is only equipped with a sword, though he can eventually find other weapons including a gun. At the beginning, Tetsuya's only companion is the brown, cloaked alien Nao, who helps him escape the holding cell, but eventually he will find others who will help him. Other standard RPG features are also present: items can be found and stored, and some characters can learn magic. The game uses a password system to save progress.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 4, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Micronics", "publishers": "Victor Musical Industries", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.93", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/29822"}
