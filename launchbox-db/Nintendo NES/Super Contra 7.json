{"name": "Super Contra 7", "overview": "This game is based off the Contra series, and has a total of 5 areas with varying themes. The player starts with 4 lives as opposed to 3 (although the stat screen displays 5 lives at the start) and 6 continues instead of 3. The standard enemies are similar to those in the originals, but they speed up when they reach the middle of the screen and never shoot. The level designs are considerably more basic than those in Contra and are mostly original, although the first half of Area 4 bears a strong resemblance to Area 4 from Super C.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "", "developers": "Waixing", "publishers": "E.S.C.
