{"name": "Snoopy's Silly Sports Spectacular!", "overview": "This video game is a collection of six events that uses various characters from the Peanuts series (Donald Duck in the Japanese version) as opponents. Events include boot throwing (similar to hammer throwing), pizza balancing, and sack racing, among others.<br><br>In the background, landmarks unique to Italy are shown (i.e., Leaning Tower of Pisa) and the structures using Roman architecture (i.e., the Colosseum) are shown while the player competes at the six events. Playing the \"River Jump\" event requires impeccable timing; like in the long jump event in the Track & Field video game Dewey (in the Donald Duck version), always pushes the lagging player ahead of the leader, allowing them to catch up. A majority of the game seems to be ported from the Commodore 64 video game Alternative World Games by Gremlin Interactive.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "September 22, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kemco", "publishers": "Kemco", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.92", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1405"}
