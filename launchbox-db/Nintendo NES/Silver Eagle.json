{"name": "Silver Eagle", "overview": "Silver Eagle is a 2D overhead action game reminiscent of Metal Gear with less stealth and more action, in which you walk around a dungeon shooting down enemies as an US American soldier. Worlds are divided on rooms, each one with several medals which you have to collect before advancing to another one. Rooms are filled up with various types of enemies (shooter, grenadier, bomber, etc.) and labyrinths, providing a gradual challenge on medal collect. You can walk and shoot only on the four basic cardinal points, having a special power (grenade), which damages and kills all enemies on the screen.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Thin Chen Enterprises", "publishers": "Sachen", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/47551"}
