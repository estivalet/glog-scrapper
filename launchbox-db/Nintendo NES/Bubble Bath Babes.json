{"name": "Bubble Bath Babes", "overview": "This is a Tetris variant with an adult theme. At the bottom of the play field, a naked woman bathes, sending up bubbles of different colors. Your task is to arrange those bubbles on the top of the play field in such a way that they create a line of several bubbles of the same color. When you succeed, the bubbles of the same color will disappear. When the whole play field is filled by bubbles, you lose. There are two types of gameplay (one grants you powerups which allow you to clear quickly a large amount of bubbles), with four stages each. You'll get various mildly erotic scenes after completing the stages, and a \"reward\" in the end. There is also a two-player mode.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "C&E", "publishers": "Panesian", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoDJICxx0Ys", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/18758"}
