{"name": "Rampart (Konami)", "overview": "In this Famicom version of the arcade hit, you are faced with 4 different scenarios (of increasing difficulty) and more depth than the original game. But the basic elements of Rampart are still there: first you build a castle from Tetris-esque pieces. Next you place a series of cannons and use them to bomb the enemy. Then you repair any damage the enemy inflicted on your fort, and do it all over again. When you reach a certain number of points, the scenario is cleared and you can pick another one.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "November 29, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Tengen", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/126052"}
