{"name": "World Champ", "overview": "World Champ is a boxing game that has many similarities to Data East's Ring King. You can play a one player \"Ranking\" mode, where you can build your boxer's stats up while climbing the ladder to eventually challenge for a championship in one of the four weight classes. There is also a two player vs. mode where you and a friend can square off. A tournament mode allows up to 8 players participate in a bracketed tournament.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 7, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Visco Corporation", "publishers": "Romstar", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.56", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2078"}
