Sometimes Hashimoto will enter his flying time capsule and then the game will turn into a scrolling shoot-'em-up.<br><br>Gameplay will occasionally be interrupted in order to give the player a quiz question. If the player chooses the correct answer, the player will earn points which are added to their overall score.
