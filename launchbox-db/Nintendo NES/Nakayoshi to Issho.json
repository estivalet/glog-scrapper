{"name": "Nakayoshi to Issho", "overview": "Six manga authors have had their favourite pens stolen and your task is to get them back and bring peace to each setting. Each chapter is a separate entity and you cannot return to a previous area once you've moved on. At the start of each chapter you're given a special weapon which is only used in that chapter and returned to the manga author at the end, when you give back the lost pen. There are Gold Gems to collect as well!", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 10, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Yutaka", "publishers": "Yutaka", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKHPjBlUajw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27462"}
