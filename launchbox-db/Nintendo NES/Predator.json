{"name": "Predator", "overview": "Predator is a side-scrolling platformer which uses the imagery and characters from the classic Arnie movie of the same name. The game is not a faithfully conversion of the movie however - your unit has already been killed off when the game starts and you will battle scorpions, enemy soldiers and dodge obstacles etc, before facing the Predator itself a number of times.<br><br>The game is a fairly standard run-jump-shoot platformer, except that you start with no weapons at all and must collect them as the game goes on.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "March 10, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Klon", "publishers": "Activision", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.78", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baxaOYRP-z0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/355"}
