One of the enemies is fat and is named Mr. Shrapnel who roams aside of the walls of some rooms and after a short period of time he explodes. In the NES version, he is replaced by a giant rolling bomb.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "September 1, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Beam Software", "publishers": "Acclaim Entertainment", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.96", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qibK4k18Ry8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/942"}
