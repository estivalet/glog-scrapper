{"name": "Game Designer Yousei Soft: Dezaemon", "overview": "Dezaemon is a game designing application that lets aspiring developers create their own vertical scrolling shoot-'em-up. Players have control over how their ship looks, design how their levels (up to three) will look, and also create a title screen. Players can also compose their own background music and create a list of credits to give credit to the designers of their game.<br><br>There is also a sample shoot-'em-up available to play titled E.D.I.T.. It contains 3 stages of a simple vertical-scrolling space shooter where players shoot down waves of enemies and fight a boss enemy at the end of each stage. Items can also be collected which can increase their ship's speed or give their ship a defensive shield. Other items can upgrade the ships' weaponry from a Vulcan cannon to either lasers or missiles.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "September 13, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kid", "publishers": "Athena", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.79", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27015"}
