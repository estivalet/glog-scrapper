Most of the levels are spoofs of various different levels from Konami games. The gameplay is mostly like a straight forward platform game, similar to Contra. In these levels you start off with the main character Rickle (or Rikkuru), who by collecting a special power-up, can transform temporarily into one of the three different characters the player chose at the beginning of the game. There are also space shooter, driving, and puzzle levels. After certain levels you can choose different paths which consist of different stages.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "January 5, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.56", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5mscVQrdAY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/26830"}
