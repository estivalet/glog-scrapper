{"name": "Xybots", "overview": "Xybots is an unreleased arcade game port made by Tengen in 1990.<br><br>Join Major Rock Hardy and Captain Ace Gunn in their battle for supremacy against an army of invading Xybots! With a split-screen for one or two players and a unique viewing area, you'll find Xybots a challenging strategic blast-'em-up! It's non-stop action all the way and working together in two-player mode is the ultimate fun. Each player controls one character and the split-screen gives each his own playing area. A map shows the section you're battling through and the positions of the patrolling Xybots. And to keep one step ahead, pick up energy pods, super weapons, keys and coins.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tengen", "publishers": "", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.08", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/47225"}
