{"name": "3-in-1 2p Pak", "overview": "Do you like tic-tac-toe? Do you like the pegboard game? Do you like !CLIK!? What if they were also two-player competitive on the NES? Well then this game's for you! Compete against a friend, or play witchoself (get those tissues, though)! There are 3 different 2-player games, along with a bonus 2-player game that you can unlock after beating all the games as 1-player. If you look around, you might also find ANOTHER 2-player only game that is hidden within!<br><br>The entire reason I started programming this game was to try and kind of vindicate myself in some way. I had already done some other games that were bigger in scope than the games of Tic-Tac XO, Pegs and !CLIK!, but didn't like how I had coded them due to being newer using 6502 at the time. All you have to do is look at the sources for those games to understand what I'm talking about! So, I went about putting the basic elements of those games into one cart, but just more standard (for instance, just regular Tic-Tac-Toe), and for 1 or 2 players. With that said, there is some sort of glitching that happens to the PPU during Tic-Tac-Toe that I could never track down, but ah well. It was a neat project.<br><br>Snail Trail, one of the bonus games, was an idea for a parody of the Tron cycles game. Originally I was going to have the snails move UUUUU-BER slow. I think it turned out better having them move at the speed they are, though.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "August 21, 2016", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sly Dog Studios", "publishers": "Sly Dog Studios", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.44", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/125026"}
