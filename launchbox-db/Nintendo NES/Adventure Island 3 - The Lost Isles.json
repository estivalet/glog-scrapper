{"name": "Adventure Island 3: The Lost Isles", "overview": "This hack was started back in December 2007. Most of the levels were finished by mid February. The title screen was ripped from the translated NES ROM \u201cAdventure Island 4\u2033. Since I am an amateur ROM hacker (is there a professional ROM Hacker?) in every sense of the word, this took much longer to edit than someone with more experience and abilities. Also you\u2019ll notice that the palette on the title screen is a little off :P<br><br>All 8 worlds and 8 levels each have been altered. (with the exception of world 4-4 although most enemies have been changed) This is not meant to be a \u201chardtype\u201d hack but later levels can be very challenging. All levels can be completed without any enhancements. (hammer, dinosaur etc.) However it is recommended that you save your items for later levels.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "2008", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Aether Knight", "publishers": "Romhacking.net", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.29", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLbmsw4ztlA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/107578"}
