{"name": "Final Fantasy ++ World of Chaos", "overview": "This is a semi-sequel (or more like an expansion pack) for the author\u2019s previous hack, Final Fantasy ++^ (so if you haven\u2019t played that, then you probably shouldn\u2019t be playing this). At any rate, this is quite a bit harder to beat than FF++, so n00bs beware. Also, one can consider this sort of a tribute to classic SquareEnix (the way they were\u2026). It includes adaptations of various dungeons from FFs 3, 4, 5, & 6, SaGa 2 (a.k.a. FF Legend 2), and Dragon Quest 5 (along with a couple of new ones). And, of course, lots of classic FF enemies are here for you to battle.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "January 22, 2007", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/94723"}
