{"name": "Rush'n Attack", "overview": "Up for a little guerilla warfare? You asked for it. You're behind enemy lines, armed with only a knife and a mission: to free dozens of POWs hidden in an isolated, well-armored camp. If you're good, you'll pick off the heavily-armed enemy guerillas, one by one, and grab their bazookas and hand grenades. If you're great, you'll turn their weapons against them, to blow away a pack of attack dogs, a fleet of choppers, and a whole battalion of guards. But make one mistake, and it's all over. For you, our POWs... the future of the Free World!", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "June 8, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.68", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AudtO3Dp8z0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/357"}
