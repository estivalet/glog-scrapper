Eventually, several prototypes were discovered and purchased in a lot by the Nolan brothers, who released the most complete ROM to the public.<br>Kitty's Catch is a two-player game where players control cats named Pitter and Patter, and have to catch fish with their tails. The first player to fill their bucket with fish gets a shell, and the player with the most shells at the end of the time limit wins.
