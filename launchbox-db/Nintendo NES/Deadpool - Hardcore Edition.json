Levels are slightly changed to fit the new difficulty also there are some new graphics here and there and new enemies. Bosses are ruthless, the layout of the levels is changed so they can get the upper hand. Merc mode is recommended in this hack, try hell mode only if you are a veteran of ninja gaiden and already finished Ninja Gaiden in Hell, (this hack is not as broken as NG in Hell but is still very hard)<br><br>Finishing Deadpool hack on merc mode is recommended before trying this one out.
