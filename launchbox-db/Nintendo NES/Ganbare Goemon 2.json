{"name": "Ganbare Goemon 2", "overview": "Sequel to Ganbare Goemon!, Goemon 2 puts you back in the shoes of Goemon as he traverses feudal Japan looking to bring justice to any corrupt baddies he may find.<br><br>Joining Goemon in his adventure is the wacky ninja Ebisumaru which allows for simultaneous 2-player gameplay, marking the biggest difference in terms of gameplay with the original. The game keeps the straightforward side-scrolling beat 'em up formula and even removes some of the maze-like elements in the previous game, adding new weapons and upgrades to make the game more action-oriented. Wandering through the stages is still possible and you can enter several stores and locations and trigger amusing humorous sequences keeping in tone with the lighthearted spirit of the series.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "January 4, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/18457"}
