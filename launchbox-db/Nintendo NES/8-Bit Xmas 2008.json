{"name": "8-Bit Xmas 2008", "overview": "This first ever NES Christmas cart is a great gift and background for your parties. Enjoy a peaceful snow scene (based on the snow demo by Anders Astrand) instead of the typical fireplace channel on your TV. Then use the controller to change between 4 different holiday tunes with authentic 8 bit sound. While everyone is drunk on egg nog use the controller to switch between many different patterns for the colorful blinky lights that surround the edge of the cart! Top loader recommended to see the pretty colors, but front loader looks cool too", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "2008", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "RetroZone", "publishers": "Retrozone", "genres": "Life Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.44", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/76407"}
