{"name": "Gradius ArchiMENdes Hen", "overview": "Gradius was no stranger to ports and versions of the game, so why would it be weird if Konami featured noodles inside the NES flavor? The year was 1986 and Konami decided to promote the instant noodles brand Arukimendesu / Archimendes, which literally means \u201cinstant noodles to walk/to go\u201d. How, you ask? Well, this version of the game has Archimendes noodle packages instead of power-ups\u2026<br><br>And a strange message at the end: OMEDETO! KEY WORD WA \u2018GAME SNACK ARCHIMENDES DE POWER UP\u2019<br><br>Other than that, this NES version is exactly the same compared to the original.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/146604"}
