{"name": "Super Mario Bros. 1-3", "overview": "Okay, so... Long story short, it's SMB1 with SMB3 elements, like World Maps (Hammer Bros. included), Super Leaf & Frog Suit. It has a 2P CO-OP feature as well, like the NSMB series. It also has a few more features, but those are only available with a secret code that you get when you beat the game.<br><br>And graphically speaking, I'm speechless. This looks AWESOME! Colorful backgrounds, 16-bit like sprites, and a bit more... Sound department is the same, but with SMB3 tunes added in for good measure. You can't complain, and I sure didn't.<br><br>So... Yeah, I'm pretty sure you want to get this and play it so bad. And this time around, it should be easy to pick up and play. You just need to follow this instruction carefully and you are good to go.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "2019", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Corpse Grinder", "publishers": "", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Vn-4nCoSk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/140899"}
