{"name": "8-Bit Xmas 2018", "overview": "There's nothing more emblematic of the Holiday seasons than the cozy feeling you get waking to a fire and conifer brimming under with presents. That feeling of togetherness and warmth and holiday spirit shared while singing songs of the season with friends and family. That feeling of shame as you slide down the hill face first after falling trying to show off. Ah, what great times!<br><br>This xmas we are hitting the slopes and doing some skiing, so suit up and grab your gear (snowboarders are welcome too)! Score by making your way through the gates, or hit the ramps and pull off some sick tricks for big points! Be careful not to crash, it will hurt lots and your score will reset!", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "2018", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "RetroUSB", "publishers": "RetroUSB", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFXeMESkuE8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/135034"}
