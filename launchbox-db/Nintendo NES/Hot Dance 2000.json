{"name": "Hot Dance 2000", "overview": "The concept of the main game is based on the popular Dance Dance Revolution video game. The music portrayed in the video game is considered to be top 40 music from the year 2000. The object is to use the arrow keys in sync with the pop music in order to score points. Missing too many steps means game over. There are two different forms of \"dancing\" in this game: single and mix. Single dancing consists of dancing to a single song while mix dancing refers to dancing to multiple songs. Non-dancers can relax with Pac-Man and pinball. Both of these are primitive forms of video games that do not require the massive level of button mashing required in a single game of Hot Dance 2000.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "2000", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "NTDEC", "publishers": "NTDEC", "genres": "Music", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgVx-pL7gl0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/77600"}
