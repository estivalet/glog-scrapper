{"name": "Game Genie", "overview": "The NES Game Genie from Galoob is a device that allows a player to enter a variety of codes into a Nintendo Entertainment System game in order to cause the game to do things it would not normally do, e.g., grant the player extra (or fewer) lives at startup, give the player extra items, change the gameplay, or just cause crazy things to happen.<br><br>The design of the Game Genie also made it very difficult to insert into a newer top-loading NES without pressing very hard. An adapter was created to deal with the problem, which Galoob offered to Game Genie owners free of charge, but few were requested, and the stock was liquidated.[citation needed]<br><br>There also exists a version of the Game Genie for the Family Computer, distributed by Realtec and sold in areas where Famiclones were common.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Galoob", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/116179"}
