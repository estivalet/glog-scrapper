{"name": "Dash Galaxy in the Alien Asylum", "overview": "Dash Galaxy in the Alien Asylum was an action game for the Nintendo Entertainment System released in 1990 exclusively in North America. Players take the role of Dash Galaxy, a space scout who has been captured by a hostile civilization. Gameplay involves a series of floors with several rooms each. Keys must be collected to progress to higher floors and, eventually, an escape ship. Dash's only weapons are a limited supply of bombs and remote detonators. Good timing is crucial to completing the game, requiring navigation of trampoline jumps and roaming enemies. While the rooms are side-scrolling action puzzles, the floors have a  overhead view and include more difficult block-moving puzzles which can fatally trap a player.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "March 1, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Beam Software", "publishers": "Data East", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.65", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1624"}
