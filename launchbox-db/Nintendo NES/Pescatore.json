{"name": "Pescatore", "overview": "Pescatore is a puzzle game, developed by Tierheit and meant to be published by Sunsoft. Like Sunman, it never saw the light of day neither in the land of the rising sun nor the home of the brave. Nor even in places in between, as was the case with several other Sunsoft titles of the time. Unlike Sunman, however, Pescatore was briefly revealed to the public in spring of 1991 at Nintendo's Shoshinkai Show.<br><br>The gameplay in Pescatore borrows the gameplay from PuyoPuyo and changes the rules slightly to require less skill and more luck.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tierheit", "publishers": "", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "0.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuoQ-GyQYBQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83521"}
