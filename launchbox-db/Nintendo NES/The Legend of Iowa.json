{"name": "The Legend of Iowa", "overview": "It seems Iowa lawmakers have banned the OTC sale of Sudafed. Meth making gangs take note, and raid every pharmacy in the land for their precious ingredient. Farmer Bob, having just contracted a cold, takes up his pitchfork and goes on a rampage killing meth addicts and destroying their methlabs in his search for sudafed.<br><br>This is a total conversion hack of the Legend of Zelda. Virtually everything has changed,  right down to the sound Farmer Bob makes when he\u2019s taken damage. Very impressive and absolutely worth a playthrough.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "August 9, 2017", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "", "developers": "Dr. Floppy", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/158080"}
