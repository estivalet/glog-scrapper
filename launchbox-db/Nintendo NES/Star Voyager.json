Ahead lie 8 alien galaxies, 9 Molok squadrons, space streams, asteroid belts, black holes... and hope.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 23, 1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "ASCII Corporation", "publishers": "Acclaim Entertainment", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.6", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2009"}
