The most obvious game to compare it to is Dig Dug, but without the boulders and with various devices like teleporting doors, speed, dynamite, and a wet suit. There are 15 levels in the entire game; which repeat themselves after the 15th level is finished.<br><br>Lava can spew out at a vertical direction towards the player and kill him; it does not reset itself even after the players loses a life (but it does reset itself after a game over) Passwords are activated by pressing a certain button combination on the password screen. Several passwords results in cheat codes that does certain things; such as deactivating the lava in all levels of the game.<br><br>Certain type of blocks are worth different points once they are dug up; ranging from common dirt to destructible blocks. The game features an instant death clause where players die in a single hit. Killed enemies reappear at the same location where they were killed the first time.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 6, 1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Use", "publishers": "Use", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.31", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmPZKb9-PQE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27377"}
