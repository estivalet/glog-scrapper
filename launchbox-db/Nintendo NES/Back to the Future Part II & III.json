{"name": "Back to the Future Part II & III", "overview": "Get ready for a wild romp through time, Marty McFly, 'cause you're about to take off on a double mission to save the past, present and future! Better load up on pizza and soda as you rocket to the year 2015 in Doc's supercharged time machine. Hang on to your hi-speed hoverboard as you teach Biff Tannen a thing or two about stealing your Sports Almanac, and locate the special objects he's hidden throughout time. Then, if your flux capacitor isn't on the fritz, it's off to the Wild West, where sharp shootin' gunslingers want you out of town by sundown. The fate of the world -- not to mention generations of McFly's -- is in your hands... and you're out of time!", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "September 1, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Beam Software", "publishers": "LJN", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.71", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWFZS4c-TDA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/313"}
