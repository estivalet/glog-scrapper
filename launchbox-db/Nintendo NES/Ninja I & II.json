{"name": "Ninja I & II", "overview": "It's a brand new 2-in-1 game for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)! Ninja and Ninja II are a series of multiple events/mini-games. They are fast-paced QTE (Quick Time Events) based mini-games that challenge players of all ages at reactions speeds, button mashing, and precise on-screen timing; hailing from Toshi503 Studios for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). <br><br>These mini-games are geared around the utilization of different control schemes per stage/event. While most games tend to use the same control scheme throughout their game, the Ninja games try something different; while the aim remains at keeping the controls intuitive per stage. Each stage has its own unique soundtrack that I composed, so that everyone can enjoy something different as the game progresses.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "June 20, 2018", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Toshi503 Studios", "publishers": "Toshi503 Studios", "genres": "Party", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQUz_W-NBFE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/103260"}
