{"name": "Double Dribble", "overview": "Finally, it's here! The basketball game you've dreamed of. The first home game with 5 on 5, full court, board-banging action. A contest with graphics so real, they'll knock your high-tops off. Ready to captain your team to the title, you bolt into the arena with electricity in your fingers and ice in your veins. Intensity builds. The crowd roars. The game is yours to win or lose. But to win you'll need speed in the lane, touch for three-pointers, muscle to power past picks, and the skill to crash the glass. And, if you break free underneath - watch out! Because now you can power home a rim-rockin' slam! So pull up your shorts and take a deep breath. It's crunch time. Time to show your stuff!", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "September 1, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.38", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06p-VcQ6Oa0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/325"}
