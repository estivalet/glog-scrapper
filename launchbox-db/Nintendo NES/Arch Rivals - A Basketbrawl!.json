{"name": "Arch Rivals: A Basketbrawl!", "overview": "The full-court action between the Arch Rivals is really hot tonight. Here's Mohawk, taking it to the hoop... POW! He just got nailed in the alley with a right cross! FOUL! FOUL! FOUL!<br>What?! No Foul? That's right. No Fouls. This is basketball where breaking the rules is part of the rules! If you can't block a shot - knock your opponent's block off. If you can't steal the ball - steal his shorts! But don't think these tactics are enough to win. Arch Rivals still requires real B-ball skills like passing, shooting, ball handling, slam dunks, and 3 point shots.<br>Based on the arcade smash hit, Arch Rivals brings all of its hard-hitting \"in your face\" action into your home. Whether you're going for a fast break, dodging food on the court, or crashing the boards 'til they shatter, Arch Rivals isn't just basketball... it's a basketbrawl!", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "November 1, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Rare", "publishers": "Acclaim Entertainment", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.01", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fp2JjslUD4E", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1559"}
