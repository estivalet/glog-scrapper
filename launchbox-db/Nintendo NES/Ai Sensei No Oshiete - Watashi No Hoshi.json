{"name": "Ai Sensei No Oshiete: Watashi No Hoshi", "overview": "Ai Sensei no Oshiete: Watashi no Hoshi is a Japanese-exclusive Famicom non-game that is focused on astrology. The player must choose his zodiac sign, along with his or her birthdate, and the Japanese prefecture that he happens to be born and/or reside in. This software is not recommended for those who live outside of Japan for that reason. Gender must also be chosen (either male or female). There are eight different types of fortune-telling in the game.<br><br>The text in the game (for both the menus and the fortunes themselves) are entirely in Japanese. Due to graphical limitations, all the human characters seem to have blue hair in addition to blue eyes.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "March 26, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Irem", "publishers": "Irem", "genres": "Life Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.66", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANsSSogj1Jg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/19937"}
