{"name": "Great Deal", "overview": "Similar to poker, your deck consists of the four different suits with values from 2 to ace, plus one joker card, so 53 cards in total. You don't hold them in your hand, though, but they fall down from the top of the screen into a play field 5 places wide and 5 places high, filling the bottom first. And your job is to arrange them into combinations such that they disappear and do not fill up the screen.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "October 25, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hect", "publishers": "Hect", "genres": "Casino", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/29371"}
