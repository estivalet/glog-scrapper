{"name": "Wo Xiang Niao Niao", "overview": "Lin Lin knows the Frog King won\u2019t be pleased until he receives _at least_ eight flies, and he\u2019s blocking the toilet. Gosh, that\u2019s a bummer. So she has to collect at least eight flies on her way to the toilet (which is located uhm\u2026 straight to the right) for the King to let her use it.<br><br>The path is full of baddies which can hurt Lin Lin very badly, but luckily she can bounce on them with her butt. So good her mother made her eat so many mantous! If a baddie touches Lin Lin she will lose part of her clothes and will be vulnerable. Luckily you can regain your clothes with an item.<br><br>If Lin Lin falls off a ledge or gets hurt by a baddie she will have to start over, unless she touches a magic poo to save her progress. If she gets killed, she\u2019ll be respawned where the poo was.<br><br>Lin Lin also knows that if she happens to get to the frog with more than 8 flies, she\u2019ll gain access to the celestian realm (i.e. the bonus stage) where she can gain some extra flies which will count for the second segment of each level\u2026<br><br>\u2026 which has an autoadvancing scroll. Lin Lin shouldn\u2019t let the screen go faster than her, she must RUN. And she still has to collect the flies.
