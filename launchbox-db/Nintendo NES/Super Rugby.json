{"name": "Super Rugby", "overview": "Super Rugby is a rugby game released for the Famicom by ZAP and TSS. Though it shares its name with the Super Rugby international rugby union, the latter was formed years after this game's release so the name is coincidental. It is also not to be confused with the 1994 Super Famicom game Super Rugby.<br><br>The game uses a top-down perspective of the pitch with the two sides oriented vertically, and the player is able to assign points to various stats before playing a match to focus on certain areas of their playstyle. Options include a one-off \"Training\" exhibition match, a \"League\" game which pits the player against several CPU teams, and a \"Vs.\" mode for two human players to compete.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 27, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Zap", "publishers": "TSS", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27526"}
