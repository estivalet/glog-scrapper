In each location, Sherlock can walk around the city and investigate suspicious locations, such as sewers and buildings. Defeating the various henchmen (or regular citizenry) roaming around the cities and sub-locations will provide Sherlock with the funds necessary to move onto the next city via the railway stations. The ultimate goal is to pinpoint where the culprit is hiding with enough clues and confront them.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 11, 1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Towa Chiki", "publishers": "Towa Chiki", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27509"}
