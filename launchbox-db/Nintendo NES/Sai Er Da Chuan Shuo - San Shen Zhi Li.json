{"name": "Sai Er Da Chuan Shuo: San Shen Zhi Li", "overview": "Zelda: Triforce of the Gods  is a bootleg game developed by Waixing for the Famicom.  It is a backport of The Legend of Zelda: A Link To The Past for the SNES.The game plays similar to the original, although more limited.  For example, the player can't move diagonally and the sword's range is marginally more limited than in the original.  Some of the elements in the game (such as the bosses) were changed, likely due to hardware constraints.  There's new original music featured in the game (without counting the title theme, which is extended), which changes in a set order every time you move to a different screen.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "2004", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mars Production", "publishers": "Waixing", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6VKyfVcVvk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/76337"}
