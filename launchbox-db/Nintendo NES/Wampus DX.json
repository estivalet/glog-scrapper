{"name": "Wampus DX", "overview": "An update to the original 2020 release, Wampus DX is an overhead arcade narrative adventure game developed for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES).<br><br>The wampus live on a planet invaded by colonialists, who farm and mine the land for its natural resources. These resource-stripping activities threaten the local flora and fauna, especially the Mountain Wampus, who get hunted for their treasure.<br><br>As a young wampus, players set out to rid the planet of the settler invaders and restore harmony to the land. While a fun lark, Wampus explores themes of environmentalism, conservationism, stewardship of the land, and the destructive nature of colonialism.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "February 25, 2021", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "", "developers": "John Vanderhoef", "publishers": "John Vanderhoef", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLIrCjy59X0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/155666"}
