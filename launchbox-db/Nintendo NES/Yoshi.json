{"name": "Yoshi", "overview": "An airborne puzzle invasion! It's raining Goombas, Bloobers and Boo Buddies! You have to help Mario cope with the airborne invasion! As the critters fall, catch them on trays. Switch and shuffle to save the day! Stack two of a kind and they both disappear. Or, capture the whole bunch in-between egg shells. When the egg shells match, out hatches Yoshi and up goes your score! The action heats up as the characters fall faster and faster. If your piles get too high, the game is over. Choose your difficulty level and play for a high score or challenge a friend in a head-to-head hatch-off! If you like Dr. Mario, but you're ready for a whole new kind of challenge, you'll love this quick-shuffle action puzzle game!", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 14, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Game Freak", "publishers": "Nintendo of America Inc.", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.49", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1244"}
