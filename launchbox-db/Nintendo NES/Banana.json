{"name": "Banana", "overview": "The game takes place in a world called Banana Land, which is populated by anthropomorphic moles. Mr. Mole is on a picnic with his wife and son when an earthquake strikes, trapping his wife and son underground! Help Mr. Mole rescue his wife (and sometimes son) and find their way to the exit through underground areas of varying design. The game features 105 stages and a custom stage design mode.<br><br>The object of each stage is to make it to the exit after picking up all the various food items and Mr. Mole's family members. There is no way to \"die\" as such, but the player can make a mistake and make a stage impossible to complete; for this reason the player can \"give up\" by pressing the A and B buttons simultaneously to re-try the stage.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "September 8, 1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Victor Musical Industries", "publishers": "Victor Musical Industries", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.73", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3P2QykaYtU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/26718"}
