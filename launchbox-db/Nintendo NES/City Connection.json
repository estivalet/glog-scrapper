{"name": "City Connection", "overview": "Your mission: Race your speed demon car from New York to Tokyo in record time. With the cops and the enemy on your tail. They ambush you at every turn, pushing you off the road, leaping into your path. You outsmart them, firing an arsenal of oil cans you've collected in the road, knocking them out and racking up more points. Cover every stretch of the highway in order to hit the next city. You can make it. Or can you?", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "May 1, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hect", "publishers": "Jaleco", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKATJDSLf8o", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1611"}
