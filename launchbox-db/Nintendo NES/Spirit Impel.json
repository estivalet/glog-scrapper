{"name": "Spirit Impel", "overview": "Spirit Impel began life as a Byte-Off 2020 game jam submission by Passe Gaming. It was later developed into a full fledged game, completed several months later. It features plenty of \"tongue in check\" humor as you take on the role of Vin Katana, who must defeat the intergalactic corporation Ultra before they turn every video game in the universe into a pachinko machine. It appears the villains of the game are a parody of Konami. In gameplay terms the game is fairly straight forward, you make your way through six stages avoiding obstacles, shooting enemies and each stage ends with a boss fight.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "May 4, 2021", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Passe Gaming", "publishers": "Passe Gaming", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/158062"}
