{"name": "Chibi Maruko-Chan: Uki Uki Shopping", "overview": "Chibi Maruko-Chan: Uki Uki Shopping is a simple board game for the Famicom, geared towards kids. The premise is to travel the map to reach a certain landmark before the others, all while buying souvenirs at these locations along the way. There really isn't anything to the game, since your results are not saved or carried over to a new map; when you win the current game, that's all there is. The gameplay and general concept is simple with the inclusion of special cards you can receive to affect the others or yourself. In addition to gaining Yen, you can also gain Happiness Points, which you gain by buying souvenirs and sending them home to enjoy.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "October 4, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Namco", "publishers": "Namco", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.77", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73920"}
