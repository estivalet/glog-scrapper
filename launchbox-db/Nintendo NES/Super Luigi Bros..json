{"name": "Super Luigi Bros.", "overview": "This hack was created to celebrate the entire year of Luigi. It was intended to be released on the last day of the Year of Luigi and created well in advance, but poor Luigi was pipped to the post again by himself this time, when Nintendo announced his upcoming game in NES Remix 2. This hack is different to Nintendos recently announced Super Luigi Bros. Luigi will not jump higher than he originally felt like and he will not traverse the stages in reverse. All coin blocks now bear a commemorative 30th anniversary badge and Player Two is adorned in classic Luigis blue overalls. The title screen is also slightly different. Despite Luigis best efforts, picking up a power flower will still attribute fire Marios palette.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "February 13, 2013", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "L___E___T", "publishers": "Romhacking.net", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.31", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/103085"}
