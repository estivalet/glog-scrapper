In some stages you can only make progress after finishing certain tasks or solving little puzzles, like finding keys or special items or repeating a certain sound with bells. At certain places Astro Boy must also make use of his jetpack, which can only be used a certain amount of time, after which you have to wait a bit until it has cooled down enough for reuse.
