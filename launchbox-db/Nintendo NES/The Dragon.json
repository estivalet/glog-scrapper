{"name": "The Dragon", "overview": "The player assumes the role of Bruce Lee, who uses Liu Kang's sprites. The levels are split into a platforming/action section and a one-on-one fighting section, with both sections using the same control mechanics. The end level boss is another character from Mortal Kombat 1 but is renamed in a ridiculous fashion. The bosses are made up of Scorpion, Johnny Cage, Sonya, Kano, & Raiden. Cinema scenes before and after each level loosely refer to some of Bruce Lee's films.<br><br>Besides the main story mode there is also a \"battle\" option, which allows you to select and fight any of the five level bosses in a best 2-out-of-3 match. There is no option for a 2nd human player to join, nor can you play as any of the other characters.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ramar International", "publishers": "Ramar International", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEQMAK0vLpc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75828"}
