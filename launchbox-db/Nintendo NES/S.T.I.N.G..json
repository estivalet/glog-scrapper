{"name": "S.T.I.N.G.", "overview": "Best described as Lunar Lander with guns, Sting is a devilishly addictive shooter that plays unlike anything else we\u2019ve ever seen. You control your ship in the game much like you do in Asteroids. The arrows change the ship\u2019s heading and there\u2019s a button for thrust. Unlike Asteroids, however, this game takes place on a planet, meaning there\u2019s a constant downward pull. You have to navigate your way to higher and higher altitudes while dealing with turrets and other enemies along the way.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "2008", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "smkdan", "publishers": "", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/92143"}
