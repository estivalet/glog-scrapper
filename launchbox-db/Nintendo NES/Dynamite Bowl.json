{"name": "Dynamite Bowl", "overview": "The general concept is that up to five players can play on any of the 30 bowling lanes available; simulating the concept of being in a bowling league. Players can change their lane positioning, determine how strong the throw is, and even make the ball go through various curves (or even through a straight ball into the pins). Each player character can be either male or female with options for bowling ball weights ranging from 7 pounds or 3.2 kilograms to 15 pounds or 6.8 kilograms.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "May 24, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Softvision", "publishers": "Toshiba EMI", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "5", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27029"}
