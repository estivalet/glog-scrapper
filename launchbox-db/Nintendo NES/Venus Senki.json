The goal of these sequences is to eliminate all the enemy's craft as they fly or drive towards the player, using a finite supply of missiles and an endless supply of bullets. A certain number of special enemy types, usually purple in color, need to be destroyed for the unit to disappear from the strategic map.<br><br>Role-playing elements also take precedence with the player's ability to level-up and gain experience from fights.
