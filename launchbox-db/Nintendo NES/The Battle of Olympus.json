But alas, one day, Helene fell victim to the fangs of a venomous serpent and was turned to stone. Your adventure will take you through ancient Greece on a classic mythological quest. It may be easy to defeat the snakes and centaurs that inhabit most of the cities but how will you defeat Hydra? Or the terrible three-headed dog, Cerberus?
