{"name": "Castlevania Remix", "overview": "Castlevania Remix is a hack of Castlevania which incorporates the use of a few simple tones for the palette in order to create a bit of a sepia/black-and-white quality to the game, which lends itself very well to Castlevania, making it look more like a silver-age era monster film, which is definitely where the idea for Castlevania originated. Some might scoff at the use of a palette like this, but making the graphics look this detailed on the NES with a small set of colors is no small feat.<br><br>Besides the graphical changes, the level layouts are also changed, and in some spots it\u2019s a lot more difficult, and in others it\u2019s easier. One thing to watch out for, though, is a distinct lack of hearts, which makes bosses a lot harder to defeat since you will only get off a few shots with your weapons before having to resort to your whip. Oh, and also be on the look-out for camouflaged staircases in a few spots\u2013 if you can\u2019t find them, you may find yourself stuck.<br><br>Also of interest is that the soundtrack has been rearranged slightly, and in some spots modified\u2013but the sound hacks still need a little work. Perhaps in a future version.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "2002", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Thaddeus", "publishers": "Romhacking.net", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.69", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBozF66qiVQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/107576"}
