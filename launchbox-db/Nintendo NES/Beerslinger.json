{"name": "Beerslinger", "overview": "Beerslinger is a fairly straightforward game - you play a bartender and you serve beers to your patrons. The catch? Not every patron orders the same beer, and you'll soon realize that you'll have multiple orders at once!<br><br>As the levels increase, the choice of beer changes, more orders come in, and it can become crazy in no time! To add to the pressure, the customers will only wait so long before they decide to go to a different bar!<br><br>To add to an already addicting good time, Beerslinger uses voice samples for the patrons, stating the beer type they'd like.<br><br>Do you think you have what it takes to be a true Beerslinger?", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "May 22, 2015", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Retroscribe", "publishers": "Second Dimension", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/128007"}
