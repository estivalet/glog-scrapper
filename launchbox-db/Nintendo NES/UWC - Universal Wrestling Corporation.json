{"name": "UWC: Universal Wrestling Corporation", "overview": "UWC is a wrestling game that features wrestlers that were part of the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) and World Championship Wrestling (WCW) Inc., such as Jimmy Garvin and Barry Windham. The title UWC is significant, as the title was the original name for the company WCW that was very quickly renamed sometime in late 1988. <br>The game features three modes of play with three different difficulty levels, including support for two players. If you are playing on the easiest difficulty level, the game will gradually up the difficulty level until you are playing on \u201cMaster\u201d difficulty. The goal of the game is to get your opponents HP as close to zero as possible so that you can pin them down. The closer your opponents HP is to zero the easier you can pin your opponent. While relatively simple, the game is quite challenging.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Thinking Rabbit", "publishers": "Never Published (Prototype)", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/116209"}
