{"name": "We Are Hejickle", "overview": "We Are Hejickle is a homebrew action game, developed by Pubby with music by MovieMovies1. The goal is to progress through the floors by walking onto exits. Killing enemies is optional, but often a necessity as you can't take the stairs when an enemy is adjacent to you. Along the way, you'll collect gems which can be used to purchase items in shops.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "January 31, 2019", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "", "developers": "Pubby", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133225"}
