Each room is a separate puzzle, where the main objective is to pick up and stack L-shaped building blocks to construct stairs or bridges and reach the exit door. In each of these rooms, the player has a limited number of times that they can pick up these building blocks. The player must also avoid touching roaming enemies like flying bats, golems and the priest guards.
