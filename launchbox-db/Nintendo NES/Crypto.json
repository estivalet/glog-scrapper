{"name": "Crypto", "overview": "It is a coop only game, you will need a second player to play it efficiently.<br><br>Your objective is to bring all 4 magical items to their right places at center. They are randomly placed in dungeon and you should search for them and carry them back.<br><br>Tricky part is there are monsters and you can't attack while carrying. Also you are slow as snail while carrying and so it is expected that one player should carry and other should defend him.<br><br>It is possible to carry same item by both players. In this case you are faster but both can't attack. Also you have to sync your keys to move at that direction.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "2016", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kabraxis", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133204"}
