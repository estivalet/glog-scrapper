{"name": "Hot Seat Harry", "overview": "The year is 7250 AD, and the judicial systems of the world have crumbled. Civil and Criminal cases are now settled in an arena-style trial to the death. The Plaintiff and the Defendant are strapped into modified Electric Chairs and forced to use their legs to push the \"Hydro-Electric Foot Pedals\", which, therefore, in turn, causes an electric current to course through his/her/it's opponent's body. There is no settlement. There is no plea-bargain. Electric Justice for All!!! That's how the story of Strangulation Games' first release goes, a game which sure would've been a killer if it had been released back in the NES games and published by Active Enterprises or Color Dreams. Your objective of the game basically is to hit your joypad A button over and over until it comes loose and drop off. Every time you win the color on the screen changes, very fun indeed!!", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Memblerz", "publishers": "Strangulation Games", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/135228"}
