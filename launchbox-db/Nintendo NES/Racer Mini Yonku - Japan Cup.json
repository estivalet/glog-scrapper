It was based on the then-popular mini RC car toy fad in Japan. The title screen credits Tamiya, a Japanese toy manufacturer that focuses on model kits and RC vehicles, and their logo frequently appears in-game.<br><br>The player and the CPU opponents take turns moving over a board and acquiring money and parts for their RC car. Money collected can also be spent on new parts.
