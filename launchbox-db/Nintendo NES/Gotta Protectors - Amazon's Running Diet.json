{"name": "Gotta Protectors: Amazon's Running Diet", "overview": "This is a special game which was made for the 3 year anniversary of \"Minnade Mamotte Knight\", also known as \"Gotta Protectors\" in English.<br><br>In this endless runner you take control of the titular Amazon, one of the playable classes in Gotta Protectors. The game auto scrolls to the right and you have to use your character's abilities (slide, jump, back flip, double kick) to pick up water while avoiding cake icons. When the hydration gauge at the bottom of the screen runs out it is time for a hilarious game over. In the end, depending on how many cake icons you accidentally picked up, you will either lose or gain weight.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "2017", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "", "developers": "Ancient", "publishers": "Ancient", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.43", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwpX9cmMLNA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86863"}
