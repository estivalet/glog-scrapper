{"name": "Castlevania", "overview": "If you think it's scary on the outside, wait'll you see the basement! You're in for the longest night of your life. Ghosts, goblins, demons, wolves, bats - creatures lurking around every corner. As you descend deeper and deeper, they get thicker and thicker. Better stick close to the cavern floor - it's your only chance of finding a weapon or two. You're gonna need 'em. Because when you finally meet the Count, you know he'll be going for the jugular. So keep your courage up and your stake sharp. And say your prayers!", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "September 26, 1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.28", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ls4iiGYfQkI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/130"}
