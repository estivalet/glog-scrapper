{"name": "Wit's", "overview": "The console version of Wit's, while playing very similarly to the arcade version, still has a few slight overall differences. While the arcade version has you progress through 99 levels, the console version has, much like the Mega Man series, a stage select screen where you choose the opponent you're to face off against. Each of the five initial levels consists of five rounds and features a different gameplay gimmick that you'll have to master. In addition to the single player game, the game also features various multiplayer modes for up to four players.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "July 13, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Athena", "publishers": "Athena", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/26679"}
