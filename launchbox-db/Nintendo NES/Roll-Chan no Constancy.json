{"name": "Roll-Chan no Constancy", "overview": "Roll-Chan No Constancy is a hack of the Rockman 2 game. This is originally a well done hack made by IKA, all of the eight robot masters levels seem to be completed and the Dr. Wily stages altered. This hack includes a completely new soundtrack, new graphics, altered bosses/weapons, and completely new level layouts. The difficulty level has been ramped up, but not as much as in other Mega Man 2 hacks. The hard version of the patch makes the game just about impossible because enemies can continue to hit your character without any reflex time. This makes it so once you come in contact with a boss, you have pretty much lost the fight.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "September 12, 2016", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sfon", "publishers": "Romhacking.net", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT0K7BLKZIw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/107597"}
