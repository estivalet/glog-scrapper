{"name": "Bandai Golf: Challenge Pebble Beach", "overview": "One or Two players can play a round on this video course modeled after the real Pebble Beach. Each player can select their own handicap. Every one of the 18 holes has familiar golf hazards - bunkers, slopes, and water hazards. You'll also have to contend with some of Mother Nature's hazards like changing wind conditions and Pebble Beach's most difficult obstacle - the ocean.<br><br>Once you tee off you'll have all kinds of decisions to make. Check your score card to see how you're doing. The card tells you the distance in yards and par for each hole. The computer gives you a bird's-eye view and cross-sectional view of each hole, as well as close-ups of the green. You select the right club for each shot. Control your shot to get the power, distance, and hook or slice you want on the ball. After you've made your shot the computer tells you what kind of lie you have as well as the remaining distance to the hole.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "February 15, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "TOSE", "publishers": "Bandai", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.96", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2usf2t5yx4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1568"}
