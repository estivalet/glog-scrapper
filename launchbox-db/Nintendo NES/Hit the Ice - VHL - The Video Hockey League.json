{"name": "Hit the Ice: VHL: The Video Hockey League", "overview": "The game is a one- to four-player game based on the game of Ice Hockey. It takes place on the Official \"VHL\" (Video Hockey League) ice rink pitting the Reds (left side) against the Blues (right side). Each team is made up of three players -- two forwards and a goal tender. The object of the game is to shoot the puck into the other team's goal.<br><br>The game offers fights, trips, body slams, shattering glass, blazing shots, head-over-heels bone crushing hits, hacking, slashing, spearing, elbowing and all out knock-down, punching, crunching action. You don't need to know any rules about hockey to enjoy Hit The Ice -- the ultimate red-blooded sport. There is fast paced end to end action, heart stopping incredible saves, booming slapshots, impossible in-the-air 360 degree cartwheel supershots all with some good natured humor thrown in.<br><br>Players can purchase Power Drinks in the locker room between periods for an additional credit. The drink promises \"Skate Faster, Shoot Harder, It really, Really works!\" At the start of the next period the player will undergo a wild cartoon-like transformation that turns the character into a maniac for the next minute of play.<br><br>The game was briefly reviewed in Nintendo Power Volume 47 and was scheduled for release in April 1993. Conversely, it was reviewed again in the next issue and slated for a May 1993 release. It then received a full review in Volume 49. Ultimately, the game was never officially published.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Taito", "publishers": "", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.57", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4PBcMP8kvk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/80477"}
