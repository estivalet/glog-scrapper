{"name": "Kunio-kun no Nekketsu Soccer League", "overview": "Hi, I am Misako of Nekketsu High. I am the manager of our local soccer team. Finally, we can prove that Nekketsu FC is the greatest team in the world. If we work hard and qualify, the Technos Japan Cup will determine who is the greatest in the world. After Nekketsu FC was formed, I was supposed to lead the team to victory, but I haven't been able to keep my promise. But Kunio is here, and he will guide us to victory. I won't meddle in, but I will offer my advice if you want it. Nekketsu FC, let's go!", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "April 23, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Techn\u014ds Japan", "publishers": "Techn\u014ds Japan", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.96", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQyov54NFO4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/24177"}
