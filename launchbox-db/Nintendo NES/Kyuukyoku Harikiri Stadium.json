{"name": "Kyuukyoku Harikiri Stadium", "overview": "Kyuukyoku Harikiri Stadium is the first title in a whole series of baseball games from Taito. Players have the option between a 1-player game against the CPU or a 2-player game. They have the choice to pick a team from a pool of thirteen non-licensed teams. Each team has its own players with slightly different stats. The third and last mode is a special homerun race. The players compete to hit as many homeruns in a given number of tries.<br><br>The game itself follows the standard formula of nearly all baseball games of its time, with having a 3rd-person view from behind the batter or pitcher during the pitching/batting scenes and an overhead view of the field once the batter player hits the ball. After a successful 1-player match a password is given with the option to increase some of the player's stats.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "June 28, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Taito", "publishers": "Taito", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/47823"}
