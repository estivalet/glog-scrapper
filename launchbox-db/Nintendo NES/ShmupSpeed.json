The NES game was developed by @KHAN Games to supplement the site.<br><br>Eventually a team was put together and a limited physical run of 10 copies of the game was made, with the goal being to raise funds for the charity Extra Life, which Gloves participates in each year. 5 were given to the team behind the production, and 5 were auctioned off for charity on NintendoAge. The auction raised over $1200 for Sick Kids Hospital in Toronto.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "November 3, 2018", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "KHAN Games", "publishers": "Gloves", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__6dzorslC4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/160543"}
