{"name": "Duck Hunt", "overview": "Your trusty hunting dog wades into the marshes to flush out your prey. Your fingers tighten around your Zapper light gun. Suddenly, there's a duck in the air! You've only got three shots to bag this duck, and if you miss, even your dog laughs at you! But become a sharp shooter, and you'll progress to the next round where two ducks fly up at the same time. And then you're on to the ultimate challenge: Clay Shooting, where you'll compete in a wild clay-pigeon shooting contest. Play DUCK HUNT and discover you can have lots of laughs and be challenged at the same time!", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "April 21, 1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nintendo", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.9", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttC12Q3518Y", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/328"}
