{"name": "D-Pad Hero", "overview": "D-Pad Hero is played as a rhythm game. Notes fall from the top to the bottom of the screen in sync with music. As they reach a threshold players hit buttons on the controller which correspond with the note. If the player hits the correct button sequence at the right moment the guitar track in the song will continue to play. If the note is missed the guitar track will silence until the player successfully hits a note. This is similar to the Guitar Hero and Rock Band video game series, in which notes appear on a virtual highway which progressively moves lower onto the screen.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "2009", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kent Hansen, Andreas Pedersen", "publishers": "Unlicensed", "genres": "Music", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.93", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/30868"}
