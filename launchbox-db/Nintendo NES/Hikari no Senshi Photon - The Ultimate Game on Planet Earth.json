{"name": "Hikari no Senshi Photon: The Ultimate Game on Planet Earth", "overview": "Photon: The Ultimate Game on Planet Earth (also known by the title \"Hikari no Senshi Foton\", meaning \"Soldier of Light Photon\") is based on the toy license with the equally grandiose title that would later be rebranded as Laser Tag.<br><br>It is a 3D maze game like Wizardry and many other computer games of the period, though instead of an RPG the game is a shooter. It was never released outside of Japan, despite Photon being a US trademark.<br><br>The goal is to explore the maze, including its many floors, while shooting down the alien creatures and finding items to help the main character's quest. The player can move up or to the sides, provided those directions are not blocked by a wall. When turning left or right, the next screen will still face forward but the player will have turned 90 degrees. Items like the compass and counter should help the player from getting too lost, as much of the maze looks identical.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "August 28, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Advance Communication Company", "publishers": "Takara", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27119"}
