{"name": "Battle Kid: A Perilous Trap", "overview": "After having uncovered a plot to build a Supermech, you head to an ancient high-tech fortress in an effort to prevent this weapon from being completed. You must navigate through the various sectors of the fortress, while battling its denizens and avoiding its many dangers. Along the way, you will uncover items that will allow progress to new locations of the fortress and grant you new abilities. <br><br>Over 550 rooms, more than 30 enemy types, and 8 bosses stand between you and victory. Also featured are 5 difficulty settings and a password system. Much more than a reproduction, this original game cartridge is built using all new parts.
