{"name": "Glider", "overview": "Jump into your Glider and ride the vents to escape The House in the first ever flashable NES game from Brian Parker.<br><br>In the most advanced homebrew yet, you control the paper airplane in search of a way out of the 60 room house.  Fly over floor vents to get lift or use fans for a speed boost. This house wasn't built very well, so you will have to avoid water leaks, arcing outlets, paper shredders, and other dangers. Shoot down fast moving enemy planes with rubber bands for more points!<br><br>When you beat The House, use your USB CopyNES system to flash a brand new house to the cart.  Also user the CopyNES to backup your saved games to your PC.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "2008", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Brian Parker", "publishers": "Retrozone", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDy82TKaJp0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151520"}
