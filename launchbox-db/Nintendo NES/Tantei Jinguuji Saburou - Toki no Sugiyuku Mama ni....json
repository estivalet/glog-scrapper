{"name": "Tantei Jinguuji Saburou: Toki no Sugiyuku Mama ni...", "overview": "The fourth game in the Jake Hunter/Tantei Jing\u016bji Sabur\u014d series, the second on a regular Famicom cartridge, and the last for the Famicom. There is a burglary at a mansion, which Jake goes to investigate. He sends his assistant Yulia Marks to search for the home of a young boy. While both cases seem simple on their own, they get more complicated when they become one.<br><br>Like the rest of the previous entries in the series, time plays an important role. The player must solve the mystery within a timeframe, and each command takes a certain amount of time. If the player takes to long, they won't solve the mystery, resulting in a bad ending. Like most Japanese graphical adventure games, several commands are presented to the player, and the player must choose one. Because this game is on a cartridge rather than a Disk Card, progress is continued via passwords rather than save files.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "September 28, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Data East", "publishers": "Data East", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83817"}
