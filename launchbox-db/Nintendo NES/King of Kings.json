{"name": "King of Kings", "overview": "A fantasy-themed strategy. It plays something like Famicom/Advance Wars or Daisenryaku, where the goal is to quickly conquer locations by producing a lot of units each turn and sending them against enemy forces. As with those games, there is also a little close-up graphic of the two units whenever they meet for battle, which shows how the two sides are faring in the conflict.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 9, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Atlus", "publishers": "Namco", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/44322"}
