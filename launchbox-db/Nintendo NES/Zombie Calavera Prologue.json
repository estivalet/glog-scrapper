{"name": "Zombie Calavera Prologue", "overview": "To be able to move to the purgatory, Santos must open a door and, for that, he needs spiritual energy. The only way to get enough spiritual energy is gathering up to sixteen crucifixes in the graveyard. The problem is that it won\u2019t be an easy task.<br><br>The graveyard is infested of monsters. Santos, carrying a powerful shotgun, should be able to eliminate them without much of a hassle, although this won\u2019t be always a good idea, because dead monsters will come back in the shape of winged spirits which will pursue you relentlessly and which are much more difficult to dodge. Luckily, they are almost blind so if you hide in the background and don\u2019t move they will stop seeing you and they\u2019ll go away.<br><br>Usually you can hide behind pinacles, big trees and the weeds growing in the corners or next to a wall. You will soon discover which places are good hideouts and which aren\u2019t. If you think you are hiden but spirits keep approaching\u2026 Look for a better place!<br><br>Finding the best hideouts, being patient and shooting only when needed are the keys of success in your mission.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "2010", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "The Mojon Twins", "publishers": "The Mojon Twins", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/150464"}
