{"name": "Gyromite", "overview": "You'll need R.O.B. - the world's first Robotic Operating Buddy - to play this action-packed game! You've got to keep R.O.B.'s gyroscope spinning in order to help a mad scientist deactivate all the dynamite in his laboratory. You'll move columns up and down to speed the scientist on his way while trying to avoid the lethal Smicks. And you'll get him to his dynamite even faster if you can get R.O.B. to spin two gyros at the same time! But don't take your eyes off the scientist, because anything can happen in GYROMITE! Where two hands and one pair of eyes aren't always enough!", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "August 13, 1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nintendo", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.06", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQDhcwyrf2Q", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1266"}
