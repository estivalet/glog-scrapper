{"name": "Street Fighter Zero 2 '97", "overview": "Street Fighter Zero 2 '97 is a pirated port of Street Fighter Zero (known as Street Fighter Alpha in Western territories) made by Hummer Team and published by NT in 1997. The bad boys from the Street Fighter series are back for more fisticuffs of fury! Eighteen different combatants, some old and some new, are here to lay claim to the title \"World's Best.\" Screamin' moves like Ken's Dragon Punch, Adon's Jaguar Tooth and M. Bison's Somersault Skull Driver will blow you away! Play alone or pummel a friend in two-player simultaneous action. This ain't no cakewalk.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "1997", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hummer Team", "publishers": "NT", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.65", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FTd8vd6ACE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/26927"}
