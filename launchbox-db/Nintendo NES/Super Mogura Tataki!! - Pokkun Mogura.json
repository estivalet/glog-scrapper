{"name": "Super Mogura Tataki!!: Pokkun Mogura", "overview": "Super Mogura Tataki!! Pokkun Mogura (\"Super Mole Bash!! Pokkun Mole\") is an action game for Famicom based on the classic fairground/arcade game \"whac-a-mole\".

Because the Power Pad had twelve buttons, the different stages could be configured differently: for instance, the first level had a ring of eight buttons on the right side of the pad, whereas the next level included the left, right, and bottom row of buttons to form its eight around an island in a U shape.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 8, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "IGS", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/P0Zs8kEBsyY?t=1405", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83808"}
