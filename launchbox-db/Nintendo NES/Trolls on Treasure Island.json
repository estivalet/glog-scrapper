{"name": "Trolls on Treasure Island", "overview": "In this puzzle game, the player controls one of the trolls as they bounce back and forth across the screen trying to acquire the jewels on the playfield. The one caveat is that the players troll has to match the color of the jewel he or she is trying to collect. To become the correct color to snatch up the jewels, the player has to bounce across a paint can that will change your trolls hair to that of the same color as the paint can. The object in each puzzle is to retrieve all the treasures in a room without their character falling prey to the various enemies in rooms or running out of time.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "January 1, 1994", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "American Video Entertainment", "publishers": "American Video Entertainment", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.15", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2050"}
