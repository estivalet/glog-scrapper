{"name": "Super Mario Bros. 8", "overview": "This Hack is a request from Super Buni. Enjoy it! The main concept? To remake Super Bros. 8, a Chinese bootleg that used the excellent Don Doko Don 2 (1992, Taito) as a base.<br><br>Because the changes made by the Chinese in the game are poorly implemented, it has been chosen to redo all the work from scratch. Here are some of the changes:<br><br>\u25cf New Intro and title screen<br><br>\u25cf New text font ripped from Super Mario Bros. 3.<br><br>\u25cf Using as a base the excellent English translation of Don Doko Don 2 by MrRichard999 and Guyver, the cinematics are partially redrawn and the script is adapted to go along with the Hack theme.<br><br>\u25cf Main sprite and 90% of the enemies have been replaced or modified<br><br>\u25cf Minor changes to the backgrounds<br><br>\u25cf By popular demand and thinking that most people who are nostalgic for this cartridge are Spanish-speaking, it also includes a Spanish translation.<br><br>\u25cf Some funny cameos and Easter Eggs have been added.<br><br>And much more! Just take a look at the Readme file, or play the game and enjoy it!", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "2021", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "", "developers": "Crying Onion", "publishers": "Taito", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyLFLb-FJNs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/153052"}
