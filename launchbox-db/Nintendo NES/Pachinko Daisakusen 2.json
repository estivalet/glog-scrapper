{"name": "Pachinko Daisakusen 2", "overview": "Pachinko Daisakusen 2 is the second game in its series for the Famicom. It is still about playing pachinko, but the premise is a little bit different. The game takes on more of a detective theme, in that you must use clues provided to you, in order to catch up to another agent. Of course, that involves playing quite a bit of pachinko! There are four stages this time, which may seem short, but it really comes down to luck after a while.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "July 19, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "C-Dream", "publishers": "Coconuts Japan", "genres": "Casino", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.38", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/77875"}
