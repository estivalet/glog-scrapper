{"name": "My Life My Love: Boku no Yume: Watashi no Negai", "overview": "My Life My Love: Boku no Yume Watashi no Negai (or \"My Life My Love: My Dreams My Desires\") is a board style game for the Famicom. This is a board game for one player (no human or computer opponents).<br><br>You start as an angel in heaven. Your number is drawn at random, which means that you are the next angel to be delivered to Earth to become a human being. You start as a child and live your whole life (dying at 100). Throughout the game, you will do your best to improve your statistics in six categories: knowledge, health, friendship, love, popularity and wealth. You will be ranked among the Japanese population to see how well you are doing in six categories. Japan has a population of 130 million. You will then start at #130,000,000 and try to get to #1. The entire course is very long. You can expect to play it for about 50 hours, and that's as long as you win on the first try. You will not do this on your own. Reaching #1 in the ranking is not easy.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "August 3, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Winkysoft", "publishers": "Banpresto", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrqVPgxBgR4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83678"}
