{"name": "Hidden Chinese Chess: An Qi", "overview": "Hidden Chinese Chess, also known as Um Chi and Glommy Chess, is a Dark Chess game developed by Joy Van.<br><br>The game plays like a standard Dark Chess/Banqi game, which in itself is a more casual variation of Chinese Chess. It is played on half of a Chinese Chess board with pieces placed within the squares (as opposed to on the corners like in Chinese Chess) faced down. Each player takes a turn turning over a piece, with whatever color piece is uncovered being that player's team. The pieces that are uncovered move one square each in the four cardinal directions (save for cannons) to move or capture other pieces. Each player then continues to uncover pieces and try to either eliminate all the opponent's pieces or capture the very last piece.<br><br>The game's glitchy, with one being a game-breaking bug common if the player does too well at a match; the computer will try to turn over the bottom-right most piece, but if it's already turned over or unselectable it will just sit there forever, requiring a reset.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Joy Van", "publishers": "Sachen", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJfjX1j8lY0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83596"}
