{"name": "Roundball: 2 on 2 Challenge", "overview": "Playground basketball goes big time with Roundball: 2-on-2 Challenge. Just imagine half-court, two-on-two (or one-on-one) basketball in an arena setting, complete with a scoreboard and an excited crowd. Your view of the playing area is all encompassing from the half-court line at the bottom of the screen to the basket itself as you near the top. Choose from the players available to customize your own team as you pass, block, steal, dunk, and shoot three-pointers on your way to victory. You can even shoot free throws should the other team foul you. If you think you're good enough, play Tournament Mode and take home the Roundball championship.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "May 1, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Park Place Productions", "publishers": "Mindscape", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.35", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T39gmkgbLtU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1954"}
