{"name": "Rod Land", "overview": "Rodland features two fairies called Tam and Rit, whose mission is to rescue their mum who's been captured and taken to a castle. <br><br>There are 40 screens to clear, all full of baddies, who are disposed of by grabbing them with a stick, and flipping them from side to side to inflict damage. The hits needn't all be inflicted at the same time, as it's possible to release them to move them out of the way.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 11, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sales Curve Interactive", "publishers": "Jaleco", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.86", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7E-DxCQjgg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1949"}
