{"name": "Pro Yakyuu? Satsujin Jiken!", "overview": "Pro Yakyuu? Satsujin Jiken! (\"Pro Baseball? Murder Case!\") is a slightly tongue-in-cheek parody of the Famicom's overabundance of Portopia style murder mystery adventure games and baseball simulators, especially the annual Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium releases. The player controls a professional baseball player that's been framed for a murder and must solve the case while on the lam. Capcom inserted various additional modes into the game, such as mini-games and a shoot-em-up sequence whenever the protagonist is caught by the cops.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 24, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Capcom", "publishers": "Capcom", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=LNWUIupNZvY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/92348"}
