{"name": "Street Fighter II: The World Warrior", "overview": "The game is a simplified version of the original Street Fighter II. The player can choose from 4 characters: Ryu, Chun-Li, Guile and Zangief. There is also Vega (M. Bison in Western territories) as the final boss, although his name is misspelled as \"Viga\" in this game. They all have their moves (although Zangief's Spinning Piledriver seems to be missing). Like in the original version, the player fights through the other selectable characters (here in a preset order), eventually reaching the final battle with M.Bison/Vega. The player only gets one continue, unlike the official game.<br><br>There is no difficulty selection and the game itself has hard AI (but the AI isn't as poorly programmed as the fighting games under Cony Soft's name), and it also has English in some areas, especially in the ending cutscenes.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hummer Team", "publishers": "Bit Argentina", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dGBMGI43GA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133707"}
