{"name": "Aladdin 4 ", "overview": "Aladdin (\u963f\u62c9\u4e01 in Chinese) is a port of the SNES version of the game of the same name, made by Hummer Team in 1995. The game is one of the more well known pirate ports and is commonly found on multicarts (in its MMC3 hacked form).<br><br>This game is a port of the SNES Aladdin. It has all the stages from the original and it even has the bonus game (although the genie is missing due to the NES lacking Mode 7). The game lacks Abu following you, guards being able to throw barrels at you and civilians. Also the huge snake is missing at the end when fighting Jafar. The physics are similarly programmed to that of Somari, making some of the later levels more difficult. There's also a considerable amount of sprite flicker in the genie level", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hummer Team", "publishers": "J.Y.
