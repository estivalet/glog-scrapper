You pilot your ship along the planet surface, blasting away. But first you go for the Landers - the most treacherous of the aliens. You race to the nearest Stargate and whoosh! You experience that eerie - time warp - feeling as you're transported to the other side of the planet. Only you, with the help of the Stargate, can save the planet against attack!", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "September 24, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "HAL Laboratory", "publishers": "HAL America", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.56", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNnRgoww8sQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2712"}
