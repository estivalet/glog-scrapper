{"name": "Grand Combat", "overview": "A hack of Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers that was widely published without license.  <br><br>The rescue rangers are tiny heroes.  Consisting of two chipmunks, two mice and a fly ... these heroes may be small but there's no case too big for them to take on.  This game starts out simply enough, with a mission to rescue a small kitten, but soon escalates into a wider plot that pits the rescue rangers against their arch-nemesis, the feline kingpin, Fat Cat.<br><br> Great walker with side view.  Having received the task of finding the missing kitten, rescuers rush to look for him.  However, Tolstopuz kidnaps Nut and hides it in his casino.  At first, Chip and Dale rescued her, and subsequently fought with Fatbolt.  You can play either Chip, or Dale, or together.  As weapons, mainly boxes are used.  Also, in some levels, Whack helps to cope with opponents.  Great graphics, good music.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcVWICgKW-k", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/127827"}
