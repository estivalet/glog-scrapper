{"name": "Sugoro Quest: Dice no Senshi Tachi", "overview": "In this board game style RPG, the kingdom of Siland is being attacked by monsters under the command of the evil Hades. You have to choose from several boards. Your movement is decided when you roll the dice. Certain squares trigger certain events, most being random battles. Your quest depends on which board you choose. There are four player characters, each with different statistics, like attack and magic. Battles are fought by rolling dice, and whoever gets the higher number gets to attack. Damage dealt depends on the stats of both characters and some other factors. You must complete all the boards to face the final boss.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "June 28, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Techn\u014ds Japan", "publishers": "Technos Japan", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/26138"}
