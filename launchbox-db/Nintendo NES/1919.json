{"name": "1919", "overview": "In 1919 we took a little trip across the great Atlantic, just to sink the titanic, No that was 1912. And yes for all mistakes and purposes we know world war 1 ended in the 1918 (cease-fire), with the peace treaty signed on June 28 1919. But just maybe we ripped it up and America said it\u2019s their turn to invade Germany and stop Hitler before he comes to power thus preventing world war 2 from ever happening. Yeah right but anyway it\u2019s a hack of 1942.<br><br>There are two patches Normal and Hard versions. Enjoy.<br><br>Updated for 2017, has a cleaner Title and some minor cosmetic changes, and it includes both the old and new patches.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "November 10, 2008", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "S.
