{"name": "Hyakki Yagyou", "overview": "Hyakki Yagyou is named after the Night Parade of the 100 Demons of Japanese folklore, when various youkai and other Japanese demons come out of hiding for a single night to scare people. The game is otherwise a fairly traditional 8-bit RPG, though it does feature uncommon aspects such as being able to see enemies while walking around (as opposed to the then-usual random encounters) and a regularly-proportioned adult protagonist. There is also no overworld map - both the towns and monster-infested wilderness are directly connected.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "February 23, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Use Corporation", "publishers": "Use Corporation", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27378"}
