{"name": "Rockman 4: Minus Infinity", "overview": "Made by talented ROM hacker: Puresabe, comes Rockman 4: Minus Infinity. One of the best ROM hacks that does what others only dream of achieving.<br><br>The levels, bosses, weapons and even the choice of music of the original Rockman 4 have been improved to a level that far exceeds an aesthetic standpoint - bosses have new attack patterns, weapons and moves (such as the distinguishable \u2018desperation\u2019 moves that speed up the music and make the bosses angrier and faster).<br><br>The levels have branching pathways and hidden bosses from past Mega Man/Rockman games that won\u2019t fail to put a smile on your face (such as Shadowman robbing the Egyptian temple, or Crashman hiding in the weapons artillery of Drillman\u2019s stage), the music is very well chosen from a variety of different games, and new enemies from earlier and later games in the franchise, not found in the original Rockman 4, make an already fantastic piece of programming a platforming masterpiece.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 6, 2008", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Capcom", "publishers": "Purasabe", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.29", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27804"}
