{"name": "Championship Lode Runner", "overview": "The object of the game is to pick up all the gold pieces (which appear as piles of gold) and get them to the top. Using non-violent methods, enemies had to be overcome. Bumping into enemies cost the player a life and all of his hard-earned gold pieces. Fifty of the hardest levels ever designed are used and they had to be tackled in proper sequential order. While games can be saved, the player automatically loses a life for restoring his game.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "April 17, 1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hudson Soft", "publishers": "Hudson Soft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.88", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqhGgDt-Upo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/26847"}
