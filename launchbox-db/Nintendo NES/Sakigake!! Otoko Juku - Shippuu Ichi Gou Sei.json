Otokojuku, about a private school that teaches troubled teens ouendan - a form of male cheerleading that involves percussion instruments and chanting, best known to western gamers as the core mechanic of the Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan/Elite Beat Agents games. Both the manga and the anime series - which came out close to this game's release and is assuredly its main inspiration and reason for its existence - is extremely violent as well, and the game's nature as a brawler emphasizes this aspect.<br><br>The player can select between four main characters, however they all look and play identically. Most of the game is a 2D side-scroller, though the game will switch to a depth-enhanced field - such as that seen in Double Dragon or Final Fight - for its boss battles.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "March 3, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "TOSE", "publishers": "Bandai", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/77888"}
