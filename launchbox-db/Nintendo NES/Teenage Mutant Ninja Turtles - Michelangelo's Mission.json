{"name": "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Michelangelo's Mission", "overview": "Michelangelo is the wisecracking, lovable goof of the ninja turtle team. He\u2019s immature and underdeveloped, but he loves to have fun and has boundless potential for someone so young. His hobbies include video games and comic books, and he enjoys pizza more than any other living individual, human or mutant. Despite that, he\u2019s already mastered the nunchaku, and he\u2019s well on his way to becoming a Grand Master much sooner than any of his brothers. Mikey is often teamed up with Donatello, and he finds himself as the butt of Raphael\u2019s teasing. But, he\u2019s certainly not one to let life get him down. Even if he\u2019s in trouble, he keeps his easy-going attitude intact. But that certainly doesn\u2019t mean he can\u2019t focus when needed. Mikey has the skills to back up his attitude, and his spirit and energy make him an invaluable member of the turtle team. In this episode, it looks like foot clan members Bebop and Rocksteady are on a rampage, destroying city structures and terrorizing the citizens of New York City. Mikey's on a mission to stop these two before they end up destroying the whole city...", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "2016", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "pacnsacdave", "publishers": "", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/118037"}
