{"name": "Othello (Acclaim)", "overview": "Black and White. The battle of opposites... as old as time itself... comes to life in Othello. Its origins are part Western, part Eastern. Othello is fast-paced, as easy to learn as checkers, yet as fascinating as chess. Play against a friend. Or play against the Othello computer in four challenging skill levels. You play the black discs and your opponent plays the white. Trap his discs between two of your own, and his \"flip\" to your color. One move can change the entire game. Finding that move is the secret to Othello. That's why it takes a minute to learn... but a lifetime to master!", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "November 13, 1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "HAL Laboratory", "publishers": "Acclaim Entertainment", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.87", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1880"}
