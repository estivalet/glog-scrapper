Coyote\u2122 and you've got one wild-goose chase that's fun, fast and exciting!<br>He may not be too bright, but he is hungry. And he's got his rocket, jet skates, pogo stick and helicopter.<br>Better get cookin' before you get cooked.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Beam Software", "publishers": "Tengen", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.85", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1942"}
