{"name": "Poker III", "overview": "Poker III is a casino simulator developed by Sachen and the third and final installment of their Poker series.<br><br>Instead of being a simple compilation of card games like the previous two Poker games this game is actually a board game featuring various card games called King of Casino (said games can still be selected individually at the main menu however.) The story in this mode is about a guy named Jack who is invited to Las Vegas by its mayor to become a millionaire. The player travels the playing board by rolling a die which determines what game they can choose to play or come across one of several characters. The games that can be played are King Poker (standard poker), Poker (Texas Hold 'Em), Blackjack, and 13 Cards.<br><br>After reaching a particular financial milestone (every $200,000) the game will play a cinematic of a man clapping in front of a city then posing to show one of several flying objects. They are in order a UFO, a witch, a helicopter, and a blimp with the word \"KING\" on it. When you become a millionaire the game will automatically cut to the ending which features credits.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sachen", "publishers": "Sachen", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86127"}
