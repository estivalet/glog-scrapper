{"name": "Super Arabian", "overview": "An action platformer styled as an Arabian Nights-flavored \"storybook\", which follows the trials of a brave Arabian prince as he attempts to infiltrate the palace and save a princess locked in the tower. To reach said damsel in distress, the prince must complete four \"pages\" (or levels) of the book: an ocean-bound ship, a maze of caves, the castle walls, and the tower, each infested with an assortment of mythical enemies, like flying Rocs and evil Genies.<br><br>Besides walking, jumping and climbing, the prince can cling onto vines, duck and crawl through tight passages, and glide along on flying carpets. Last but not least is the mighty kick, which sends the baddies sprawling.<br><br>To complete a level, all the lettered jugs must be collected. A bonus is awarded if they're picked up in the right order to spell out the indicated word (different word in each level). Once a princess is rescued, the next section begins, more difficult than the last.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "July 25, 1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sunsoft", "publishers": "Sunsoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.45", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TA-RmIooOI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27525"}
