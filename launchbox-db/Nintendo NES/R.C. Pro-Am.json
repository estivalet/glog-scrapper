{"name": "R.C. Pro-Am", "overview": "Nintendo puts you in control.<br>  Grab your controller and pull up to the starting line. It's you against three other all-star racers. You'll face hair-pin turns, outragerous curves, oil slicks and rainclouds as you make your way through 32 trecherous courses.<br>  Along the way you'll pick up performance boosters like Turbo Accelerations, Sticky Tires and Top Speed that will help you get to the finish line first. But if the going gets rough, use your bombs and missles to knock out the competition to make sure you're the winner.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "March 30, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Rare Ltd.", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.14", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y04CtbRKAPY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1364"}
