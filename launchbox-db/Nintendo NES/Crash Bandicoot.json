Crash must retrieve the crystals to help return the entire planet to its natural state.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "2005", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nice Code", "publishers": "Karaoto", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.35", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/124776"}
