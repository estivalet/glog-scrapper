{"name": "Master Fighter VI'", "overview": "Master Fighter VI' is a port of the Street Fighter II': Champion Edition to the Famicom, made by Hummer Team & published by Yoko Soft in 1993.<br><br>This game is like an upgraded version of Yoko's Street Fighter II: The World Warrior port. Instead of other bootleg versions of the game, it has the whole roster from the original game along with a clone for each character (the clones having different names, changed portraits and different palettes). Some of these characters have different commands for the special moves compared to the original game. (EX: Dhalsim's spinning attacks are done by doing a back-forward motion on the ground and not holding down in the air). The game includes all the stage music from Yoko's original Street Fighter II port, being used several times for other characters. The game provides three difficulty settings, however the ending is the same on any setting -- a black screen with \"congratulations\" on it.The AI also seems to be easier compared to Street Fighter II. One notable thing about this game is that the graphics for most of the fighters and stages were taken from Super Fighter III, while some of them are from Yoko's Street Fighter II. E.Honda, Zangief and M.Bison (Balrog everywhere else) are in this game despite not appearing in Street Fighter III at all (however, Zangief uses his graphics from the original Street Fighter II while E.Honda and M.Bison are custom)", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hummer Team", "publishers": "Yoko Soft", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/105028"}
