{"name": "Babel Blox", "overview": "In the land of Shinar, the people are building a tower to elevate themselves to the level of God. Take on the role of God, and scramble the language of the people and scatter them on the earth! Use twitch-style skills to recognize different languages and stop blocks from being added to the construction of the tower. Choose from a variety of languages to use, and get the people separated!<br><br>In case it wasn't already obvious, this game is based on the story of the Tower of Babel in the Book of Genesis. The object is to assign words from various languages to different people in order to confuse and split them up. This must be completed before they can add their blocks to the tower.<br><br>For each new climber you must hold the d-pad in the direction which corresponds to their color, then assign them the given word in the correct language. You are given two possible choices for each word, but only one is in the desired language. The meta goal is to learn how to identify different languages at a glance.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "2018", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "", "developers": "Robert Bryant", "publishers": "Sly Dog Studios", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts3FLk199gY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/127145"}
