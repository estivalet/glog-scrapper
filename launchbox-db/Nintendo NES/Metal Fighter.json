{"name": "Metal Fighter", "overview": "Returning from three centuries of intergalactic missions, MCS-920 is surprised by an alien-infested planet. Whatever few lifeforms survived were driven underground or transformed into battling bionic mutants. You must escape the tentacles of these mutants, seek out and destroy alien ships, then overpower grotesque alien guards to steal their fiendish and bizarre weapons. From barren landscapes and colorful coral reefs to abandoned and frozen cities, you will yet come face to face with the alien tyrant in each world!", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "August 30, 1991", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Joy Van", "publishers": "Color Dreams", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.56", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANcvVNBsJHs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1843"}
