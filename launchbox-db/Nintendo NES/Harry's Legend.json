{"name": "Harry's Legend", "overview": "Harry's Legend is a modification of Titenic based on Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (most likely the novel, as the movie came out in 2001) and was made by Hummer Technology, a successor of Hummer Team. Two versions of the game were originally released, both with title screens in English and Chinese - however, both also feature cutscenes written entirely in English. Harry's Legend has become an object of multiple unofficial rereleases, appearing on both multicarts and single game cartridges.  <br> <br>There are five levels present in Harry's Legend, all of which can be chosen right after the title screen, although all of them have to be completed in order to see the ending.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "2001", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hummer Team", "publishers": "Hummer Tecnnology", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.92", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV0fgRI9Low&feature=youtu.be", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/127830"}
