{"name": "Ikki", "overview": "In Ikki, players take the role of Gonbe (and his friend Tago if there is a second player), who are farmers living in medieval Japan. They are currently involved in an uprising against their feudal lord. The feudal lord has dispatched his army of ninjas to put a halt to this revolt. <br><br>Gameplay is viewed from a top down perspective. Players get to explore four different locations (stages) searching for gold coins (kobans) that are spread out across the land. Every gold coin has to be collected for the player to move on to the next stage. While searching for the coins, players have to deal with the enemy ninjas and other minions of the land who want to harm them. Players can defend themselves by throwing scythes at any incoming opponent. They can also pick up items such as a bamboo spear for an additional weapon, plus find items that can increase speed of movement, and an item that will give the player an extra life.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "November 28, 1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "TOSE", "publishers": "Sunsoft", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "2.69", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/23632"}
