{"name": "Bio Senshi Dan: Increaser Tono Tatakai", "overview": "The year is 2081. The Earth has become a devastated planet, overrun by monsters, controlled by a mysterious entity known as Increaser. The only hope to save the beloved Earth lies with you, a young warrior named Dan. You are sent in a time machine to the year 1999, when the monster invasion was beginning. Your task is to find your way through monster-infested labyrinths and to defeat the Increaser \u2013 whatever he (or it) is.<br><br>The game is an action platformer with more emphasis on exploration than on \"jump & run\" gameplay. You don't die immediately if a monster touches you, but have a life bar that gets gradually depleted as you are hit. Defeated enemies bring you energy points, which you can spend to buy upgrades. You start with a sword, but later obtain other weapons as well. The game's structure is not entirely linear; many areas have different doors leading to different places.<br><br>Bashi Bazook: Morphoid Masher was going to be the North American name, but it was never released. The idea fell through due to its similarity to Xexyz and the game remained in Japan. However, the game was completed, and ROMs of the game are widely circulated on the Internet.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "September 22, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atlus", "publishers": "Jaleco", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.28", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4u-fIGHG-o", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/53661"}
