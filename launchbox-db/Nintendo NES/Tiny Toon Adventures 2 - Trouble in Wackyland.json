{"name": "Tiny Toon Adventures 2: Trouble in Wackyland", "overview": "ACME ACRES IS IN FOR A BIG SURPRISE!<br><br>\"Welcome to my new Fun Land,\" a friendly voice shouts, as all of Acme Acres rushes inside the gate of the gigantic new amusement park. But soon they realize this is no ordinary, run-of-the-thrill theme park. This is WACKYLAND, a prankster packed park owned and operated by Montana Max, their arch villain who has cleverly disguised himself as a nice guy.<br><br>Suddenly Plucky Duck is stuck behind the wheel of the world's bumpiest bumper car. Hamton is riding a wild west train, dodging obstacles and enemies. Furrball is hanging on for his nine lives atop a high speed log ride. Babs Bunny's stomach is doing flip flops as she hip hops from one crazy roller coaster car to another. And Buster Bunny is lost in a funhouse maze that's turning his life upside down. Think this is amusing? No doubt! In fact, it's a hare-splitting adventure that'll crack you up as you jump aboard five wild n' weird rides that'll throw you for a loopdy-loop.<br><br>Hang onto your ears - there's more! Like Roderick Rat, Batsy, Arnold the Pit Bull and Elmyra, four foes who will give you nothing but trouble. Shirley The Loon, a hard-nosed ticket taker who won't let you ride the next ride if you're too short (on points). And dozens of traps that are stickier than cotton candy. All in all, it's like five great games in one. Making Wacklyand today's biggest attraction for your NES.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "November 27, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2036"}
