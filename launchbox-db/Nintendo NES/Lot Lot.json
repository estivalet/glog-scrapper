{"name": "Lot Lot", "overview": "Lot Lot is a puzzle game involving pachinko balls and has a superficiality similarity to that popular Japanese gambling game. Instead of firing the balls around a table full of pins that change their course, the goal is to make sure the balls run into one of the four troughs that score points, with the higher numbered scoring zones being preferable. If any drop into the \"Out\" zone, the game is over.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 21, 1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Irem", "publishers": "Tokuma Shoten", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Em1zy_pKe9w", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/44323"}
