Players must then take care of the eggs while it hatches. During this time, you have the option of flipping the egg upside-down, or changing the temperature. On the upper-left corner of the screen, there's a box that shows the current weather. If the temparature is at a certain point during the time of a different weather, the player loses and must start from scratch. When the eggs do hatch, players have the option of giving the chicken's name.<br><br>A new set of commands appears upon the chicken's hatch. Options include giving the hen food and clothes or taking it for an outing.(The latter is nothing more than a picture still.) There's also a option to save your game but for some strange reason, it does not function properly. It may be due to the fact that the game lacks a battery save.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "2001", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "EC - Early Childhood", "developers": "Waixing", "publishers": "Waixing", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/150947"}
