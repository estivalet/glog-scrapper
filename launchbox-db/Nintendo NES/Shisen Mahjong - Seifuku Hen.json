{"name": "Shisen Mahjong: Seifuku Hen", "overview": "In the game the player(s) tackle six difficulty levels with three levels in each that reward their own set of adult images upon completion of each stage. The game's notable in that it features voice clips (although low quality) and is very difficult, partially due to the lackluster programming.<br><br>There's a two-player mode in the game where if a connection isn't made in time, a sound clip will play and the other player will take control. This is probably the best way to tackle the game, considering how complex the puzzles get.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sachen", "publishers": "Hacker International", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_9tjG4h3oY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86452"}
