{"name": "Balloon Fight", "overview": "You'll need lightning-fast reactions to win this battle in the sky!<br><br>Take to the skies! It's BALLOON FIGHT. You'll score lots of points and have loads of fun when you burst enemy balloons and send their parachutes crashing into the sea. But beware. These hot-air invaders have an amazing ability to land safely, blow up another balloon and come back stronger than before! What's more, if you fly too low you'll be devoured by man-eating sharks! Challenge them alone if you think you're up to it, or team up with a friend. Either way, you'll have the time of your life fighting off your opponents in the sky and avoiding those hungry sharks below in BALLOON FIGHT!", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "January 22, 1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nintendo R&D1", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.92", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JMY2dMnK_E", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/315"}
