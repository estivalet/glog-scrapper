{"name": "Conway's Game of Life", "overview": "This is an 40x40 grid implementation of Conway's Game of Life written from scratch in 6502 Assembly to run on the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES).<br><br>Because of the 40x40 grid size in this implementation along with likely nonoptimal code, it takes about 1.25 to 1.5 seconds to calculate the next board state. I would like to apologize for how slow this program is and may look into improving the computation speed in the future.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "April 23, 2020", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Vi Grey", "publishers": "Vi Grey", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFqkNZt_gCk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151090"}
