{"name": "Street Fighter III", "overview": "From the original roster, only 9 made it to Super Fighter III, those being Ryu, Blanka, Guile, Ken (who is just a pallete swap of Ryu), Chun-Li, Dhalsim, Vega (Balrog in Japan), Sagat, and M.Bison (Vega in Japan). Everyone has most of their moves, with the exceptions of Guile's other basic attacks, Dhalsim's Yoga Flame, and Vega's Wall Climb. The stages have all been ported over, except Chun-Li's, who now uses a totally original stage for unknown reasons. Some moves are performed differently as well: Ryu/Ken's Shoryuken and Sagat's Tiger Uppercut require the player to hold Forward, tap Down while still holding Forward, and then press A. Dhalsim's air attacks are preformed by pressing A or B during the height of his jump. Also, any of the charge attacks (ones that require the player to hold down or back) will lose their \"charge\" if holding Down-Forwards or Down-Backwards. All of the music in the game is entirely original.<br><br>This game has managed to keep the gameplay close to the original although notably, it doesn't retain any combos. Unlike many pirates which either stay with 3 colors or only color in certain tiles, the way the sprites are done is that tiles are placed on top of one another similar to how the sprites in the Mega Man games are done. As the NES only has two buttons, strong/weak attacks are determined by how long the buttons are pressed. The opponents go in a preset order, instead of having the non-boss fighters be chosen at random.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 1, 1997", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "J.Y.
