{"name": "Atari Flashback", "overview": "The Atari Flashback was released in 2004. The console resembled an Atari 7800 in appearance and came with a pair of controllers which resembled those of the Atari 7800, though they were slightly smaller. The system had twenty games built-in, all originally developed by Warner Communication's Atari Inc. and Atari Corp. for the 2600 and 7800 game systems. The games which originally required analog paddle controllers were made to work with the included joysticks.<br><br>The console utilized an \"NES-on-a-Chip\" infrastructure, thus this dump of the multi-game ROM was possible. The ROM uses mapper 538 so it will only run in certain emulators.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "2004", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atari SA", "publishers": "Legacy Engineering", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151055"}
