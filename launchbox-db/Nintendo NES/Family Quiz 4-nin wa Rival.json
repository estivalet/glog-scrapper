{"name": "Family Quiz 4-nin wa Rival", "overview": "Family Quiz is a Japanese trivia game where the goal is to beat the other opponents in four mini-games, each requiring that the player answer some Japanese trivia questions in order to proceed. The four mini-games are based on: A typical game show set up, where answering questions correctly raises that player's podium towards a balloon; Othello, where the goal is to surround the other player's pieces; a board-game, where the player moves their piece around the board; a card-based memory game, where the goal is to flip over pairs of matching cards. In each game, the player gets a turn only after they've answered the trivia question correctly.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "November 16, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Athena", "publishers": "Athena", "genres": "Quiz", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27078"}
