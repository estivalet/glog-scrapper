{"name": "Baken Hisshou Gaku: Gate In", "overview": "Baken Hisshou Gaku: Gate In (or \"Horse Betting Certain Victory School: Gate In\") is a horse racing simulation game for the NES/Famicom. The idea is that there are a large number of parameters that you can adjust, such as how long a race is, where it is held, the lineage of the horses, the natural temperament of the horses, and so on. After setting as many parameters as you like, you can start the race and see which horse wins. There is no winning or losing from your perspective (none of the horses are \"yours\", and you don't get to place any bets or anything), you just change parameters and see what happens. The idea is that this game will teach you how to do well at betting on horse racing by letting you play with parameters and experiment to find what are considered the important conditions that determine what makes a horse do well in a race. There are no ending credits or anything, there is no condition to \"beat the game\". There are no seasons. It is simply adjust parameters and start the race, repeat ad nauseam.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "May 25, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Graphic Research", "publishers": "K Amusement Leasing", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.14", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/48710"}
