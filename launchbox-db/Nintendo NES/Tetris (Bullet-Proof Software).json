{"name": "Tetris (Bullet-Proof Software)", "overview": "The version of Tetris that was released in Japan for the Famicom is considerably different from the version of Tetris that was released for the NES around the rest of the world. Developed by Henk Roger's company Bullet Proof Software, it retains the unusual control scheme which makes it one of the least enjoyed conversions of Tetris for the hardware (including the unlicensed Tengen version). In addition to the controls, this version of Tetris is also unique for having \"lives\" that the player must run out of before the game comes to an end. The player is required to complete 25 lines before advancing to the next level.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 22, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bullet-Proof Software", "publishers": "Bullet-Proof Software", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.55", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs0oCVjjMf0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/48523"}
