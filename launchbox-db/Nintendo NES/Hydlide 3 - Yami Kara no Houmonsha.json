{"name": "Hydlide 3: Yami Kara no Houmonsha", "overview": "A long long time ago, longer than anyone can remember, evil decended upon the <br>good and peaceful people of Fairyland. Old legends tell of a lone brave hero who <br>saved Fairyland from the imminent threat of doom. Since then, the people of <br>Fairyland have lived through centuries and centuries of peace, and all memories <br>of evil faded away.<br><br>But one especially dark evening, a huge column of fire exploded out of the <br>deepest depths of Fairyland, lighting the night sky. The next morning, strange <br>doors began to appear from nowhere. Many who were curious entered these doors, <br>but were never seen again.<br><br>From that day on, unusual events and catastrophes began to take place. Huge <br>cracks opened in the ground, scarring the beautiful lands. Floods wiped out <br>entire villages, and the people of Fairyland experienced famine. And then the <br>monsters came.<br><br>The Fairyland council feared that the same evil in the legends was back again. A <br>wise old oracle predicted the second coming of evil. He also spoke of a young <br>man who could save Fairyland from its gravest crisis.<br><br>A young man was chosen to find the reason and source of the evil. As the people <br>gathered to bid him farewell and good luck, they couldn't help but wonder if <br>they had chosen the right one.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "February 17, 1989", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "T&E Soft", "publishers": "Namco", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27379"}
