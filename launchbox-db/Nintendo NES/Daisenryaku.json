{"name": "Daisenryaku", "overview": "One of many grand war simulations in Daisenryaku series, Daisenryaku for Famicom is a turn-based strategy with quite modern armies, the abstract \"Blue\" and \"Red\" countries (controlled by the player or AI), are at war with each other.<br><br>Three basic phases make up each turn: production, movement and combat. Like in other Daisenryaku games, each side has to produce units such as infantry, several types of tanks, helicopters, etc. Attack is possible, when enemies are near.<br><br>The game includes 30 maps with varied types of locations and terrains (islands, deserts, mountains, etc.) Each terrain type has different movement and defence values.<br><br>This version uses \"fake hexagons\" for battlefields; the hexagons are in fact squares, with six neighbours. As opposed to most other versions, it has round-based combat, i.e. a turn ends when the player has moved all the units. It also has a less complex management system than the computer versions.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "October 11, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Quest", "publishers": "Bothtec", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/26871"}
