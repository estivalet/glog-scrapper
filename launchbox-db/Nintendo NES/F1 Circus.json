{"name": "F1 Circus", "overview": "The game was released on September 14, 1990, and the word \"circus\" was meant to be a mistranslation of the word \"circuit\" (or \"circuits\") because the pageantry of Formula One racing slightly resembles a circus. It is loosely based on the 1991 Formula One season, F1 Circus is considered to be a representation of the average Formula One game for the PC-Engine. Players can modify their vehicles and customize their race cars, while racing through top-viewed tracks that appear to be going mostly straight up in a fast-paced speed, instead of any other direction.<br><br>On February 7, 1992, F1 Circus was later efficiently ported to the Family Computer. Although featuring cover art from the PC-Engine version, the content in this version is closer to that of the sequel, F1 Circus '91.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "February 7, 1992", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Make Software", "publishers": "Nichibutsu", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.9", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27071"}
