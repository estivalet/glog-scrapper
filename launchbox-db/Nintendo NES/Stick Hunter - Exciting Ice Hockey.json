Stick Hunter was the first actual ice hockey game created for a Nintendo gaming system.<br><br>The game was designed so that 1 player could play against the computer, or 2 players could play simultaneously against each other. The length of the periods and difficulty level could both be adjusted.<br><br>Playing as a character who has possession of the puck, the character could not only skate faster, but could only shoot the puck forward. So if the player wanted to pass to a teammate, the character on screen would have to be facing the person to which he's passing. The same applied to shooting at the net and attempting to score a goal. The character would have to be facing the opposing net. A player without the puck could only skate faster. If the goalie had control of the puck, he could only pass to a teammate.<br><br>As in the real-world sport of hockey, the object is to score more goals than the opposing team.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 18, 1987", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Micronics", "publishers": "K Amusement Leasing", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27521"}
