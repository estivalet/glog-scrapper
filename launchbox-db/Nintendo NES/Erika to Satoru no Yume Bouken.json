{"name": "Erika to Satoru no Yume Bouken", "overview": "Two children, the girl Erika and the boy Satoru, live together in a small house somewhere in modern Japan. One day, before going to sleep, they notice a strange creature outside: it looks like a pink-white cat (Final Fantasy fans would immediately say: a moogle!), but talks like a human being. Before the mysterious creature disappears, it says only a short sentence: \"Children! Find the Time Crown!\". Without understanding what he meant by this, but realizing it must be something important, the two young heroes embark the next day on a dangerous journey - the quest for the power of the crown!<br><br>Erika to Satoru no Yume Bouken plays like a traditional Japanese adventure, although you can also move on the overworld, visiting locations by standing on them and pressing the A button. Upon visiting a location, you can interact with characters and objects you view from first-person perspective by selecting icons located in the corner of the screen: talk to characters, examine, manipulate items, etc. The unusual part is that you control two characters: you can (and should) switch between them and sometimes work together in order to fulfill your quest. There is also a two-players mode, where Erika and Satoru cooperate while being controlled each one by a different player.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "September 27, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atlus", "publishers": "Namco", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "2.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27033"}
