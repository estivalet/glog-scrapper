{"name": "Shin Satomi Hakken-Den: Hikari to Yami no Tatakai", "overview": "Shin Satomi Hakkenden: Hikari to Yami no Tatakai (\"New Eight Dog Chronicles: Battle of Light and Darkness\") is a traditional Japanese RPG that follows the story of the 19th century historical novel Nansou Satomi Hakkenden, or Eight Dog Chronicles, based on eight half-brother samurai who were all descended from a dog and team up for various adventures across Sengoku period Japan. In particular, the game is based on the 1983 live-action movie, localized in the west as Legend of the Eight Samurai which in turn was based on a 1982 reworking of the epic novel named Shin Satomi Hakkenden.<br><br>The game has a then-distinct feature of being able to start the game as any of the eight samurai, each of which begins the game in a different location. Their goal is to meet up and recruit their brothers, eventually forming a group of eight. The game is otherwise standard for the genre: the player splits their time between exploring towns and talking to NPCs, and fighting monsters and enemy soldiers in dungeons and the overworld map via a turn-based combat system.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 8, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Micronics", "publishers": "Toei Animation", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr3UiAo2YkM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83785"}
