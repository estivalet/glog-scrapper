{"name": "Battle Rush: Build Up Robot Tournament", "overview": "The player has to build his own combat robot to use in a fighting tournament. These robots are built in factories that assign the robot a name in addition to installing its head, body, shoulder, and feet. The player has a pre-game lobby to get ready for the robot combat action. All matches have rounds of 60 seconds (unlike the 99-second round of most modern fighting video games). Both robots have a separate gauge for energy and damage. Standard punches and kicks can be thrown in addition to special moves (which look like ammunition).", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "November 13, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "TOSE", "publishers": "B-AI", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.64", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/26875"}
