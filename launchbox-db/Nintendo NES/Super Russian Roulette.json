{"name": "Super Russian Roulette", "overview": "Inspired by the best kinds of bar games (ones with simple rules that become more enjoyable the longer you play), by goofing around, and by my generation\u2019s childlike enthusiasm for that piece of gray plastic, Super Russian Roulette (SRR) is a brand new party game for the NES. One unhinged 8-bit cowboy is prepared to call you yellow, call you crazy, mourn your death, or kick up his boots for the last time. One bullet waits in the light gun\u2019s chamber. You, up to two friends, and The Cowboy take turns passing the pistol, spinning the chamber (or not!), and drinking to your own demise (or not).", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "September 26, 2017", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Batlab Electronics", "publishers": "Batlab Electronics", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "3", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeFSxS1xUjc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/150499"}
