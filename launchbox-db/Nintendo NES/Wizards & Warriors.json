In caverns of fire, through demons that fly and crawl, against the soldiers of the undead you must continue. No sorcery can prevail, for you are the only knight with the strength to wield the Brightsword. The prisoner of the wizard awaits. She calls to you from Castle IronSpire. But the wizard is watching you, warrior.
