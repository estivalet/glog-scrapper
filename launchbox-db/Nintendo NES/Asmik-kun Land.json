{"name": "Asmik-kun Land", "overview": "Asmik is not only a name of a game-developing company, but, as we learn from this game, also a cute little pink dragon. Recently, monsters began to invade the peaceful country of the dragons. The only way to stop this invasion is to contact the six Dragon Gods. Unfortunately, those gods seem to be asleep. So now Asmik must travel all over the world to find six magical splitters, that will help him to awaken the dragons and to defeat the monsters.<br><br>This is a traditional action platform game. Asmik can jump and exhale steam from his nostrils to turn all his enemies into eggs. Those eggs can be eaten and later used for various purposes (during boss battles, acquiring upgrades at a shop that becomes available once you have completed a stage, etc.). Asmik dies if he comes into close contact with an enemy. Boss battles differ from the rest of the game, each one being a mini-game of its own, for example a rock-paper-scissors game during which Asmik uses his correct choices to gain time to proceed to the next stage.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 20, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Graphic Research", "publishers": "Asmik", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.65", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V1QQI4XbNU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/26526"}
