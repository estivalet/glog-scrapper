{"name": "Jongbou", "overview": "Jongbou is a combination of the popular Chinese board game Mahjong and a block-breaking game such as Breakout. Players bounce a ball around a Mahjong table filled with concealed tiles, with their goal being to dislodge the tiles and collect the ones they wish to add to their hand by passing underneath them as they fall. The stage is over either after all the tiles have fallen or the player has a winning hand.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "July 18, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Micronics", "publishers": "K.
