Though very beautiful, the strangely quivering bubbles are part of a sinister plan, concocted by the evil Emperor O-Dinten. With the patented Dura-Bubble, he plans to profit from fun itself by controlling all the games under the sea.

It's a brain-bursting bubble battle to pop thousands of beautiful bubbles before they overflow to the open sea!", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Panesian", "publishers": "American Video Entertainment", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.58", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1842"}
