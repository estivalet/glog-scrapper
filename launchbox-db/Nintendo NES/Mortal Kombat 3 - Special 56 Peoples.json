{"name": "Mortal Kombat 3: Special 56 Peoples", "overview": "This game is an upgraded version of Mortal Kombat II Special (Unl). This game was also released under the name Mortal Kombat III Special. \"Mortal Kombat III Special Special 56 Pepoles\" also contains the Mortal Kombat II Special version in the same ROM.<br>The menus are similar to those of the MKII pirate, with the options screen being completely identical, although the character select screen was changed to look like the official MKII's and the main menu uses the MK logo as the background like in the official MKII. Some of the music and backgrounds are new, while others are reused from the MKII pirate, which are based off the original Mortal Kombat. Because of this, the MKII Special is somewhat of a mix of the first two Mortal Kombat games.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "1997", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "J.Y.
