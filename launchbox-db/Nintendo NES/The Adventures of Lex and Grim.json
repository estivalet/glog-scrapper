From hidden caves forth to terrorize the small, peace-loving villages of the valleys. Most were powerless against the ravages of these minions of darkness.<br>It was a time of locked doors and darkened windows, when people hid in their beds and prayed for an end to the night.<br>In spite of these tales of dread, warriors, adventurers and treasure-hunters would still find their way to the caves to seek fortune and glory. Two of these treasure-hunters were known in the taverns and inns of Amaranth as Lex and Grim.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "2004", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bob Rost", "publishers": "", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.95", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75775"}
