{"name": "Days of Thunder", "overview": "In the PC version, gameplay consisted of setting up the car, qualifying, and then the actual race event. If the player finished in a high enough position they would progress to the next circuit. Damage was calculated not by realistic damage displayed on the car but a \"cracked dashboard\" bar indicator, with cracks appearing along the dashboard when the player hits something.<br>The in-game graphics in the PC version paled in comparison to the still-screen graphics it had. This was due to polygonal graphics being used as opposed to sprites, rendering the car, track, and trackside details in untextured 3D polygons.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "January 1, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Beam Software", "publishers": "Mindscape", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.23", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1626"}
