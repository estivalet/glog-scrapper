It was the evil of Ganon. The evil took the form of a dark mirror, and out of that mirror came the shadow of \u201cThe Hero\u201d. Word got to the Princess Zelda that a mirror had appeared out of nowhere, Link\u2019s shadow had come out of it, and that Link\u2019s shadow had taken the mirror with him. Nevertheless Link\u2019s Shadow used the mirror to create powerful shadow crystals that have the power to seal and unseal people and objects. He has placed the crystals in the hidden temples to steal the temple\u2019s power. If the crystals steal enough power from the temple\u2019s, then Link\u2019s shadow can use the power to unseal Ganon! Find the crystals in the hidden temples before it\u2019s too late, and use the crystals power to seal the mirror away! But before that Link must defeat his own shadow!", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "April 7, 2018", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "The3Dude", "publishers": "Romhacking.net", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.12", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/125057"}
