{"name": "Donkey Kong Jr. Math", "overview": "Are you good with numbers? Well, here's your chance to prove it. Use your brains to help Donkey Kong Jr. add, subtract, divide and multiply correctly. And to make it more of a challenge, you'll have to climb up chains, jump on islands and choose the right answers in the least amount of time. Play against the computer or challenge a friend. Either way, you'll learn a lot, and no one will ever make a monkey out of you. At least when it comes to numbers!", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 12, 1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nintendo", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.02", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygo_jAosg88", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1829"}
