{"name": "The Simpsons: Bart vs. the World", "overview": "An important message from Bart Simpson: Yo! When I heard I'd won the Krusty the Clown art contest, I said, \"Forget it, man. This is Bart Simpson you're talking to, and Bart Simpson never won anything in his life.\" But Krusty said it, so there's no way to deny it. My family and I get to go on this really cool worldwide Treasure Hunt - to China, Egypt, the North Pole and Hollywood. And I need your help if I want to reach my final destination: a guest appearance on the Itchy and Scratchy Show.<br><br>Here's the deal: I have to collect Krusty faces and Krusty products. The faces are worth bonuses and power-ups, and if I collect all the products I get a special reward. Oh yeah, one other thing: If somebody tries to mess with me, they'll wish they hadn't, because I'm taking along plenty of firecracker balls. And if that's not enough... let's just say Bartman has the power of flight. Any questions? Good. Wish me luck, man. I'm outta here. Your friend, Bart Simpson.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 1, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Imagineering", "publishers": "Acclaim", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1361"}
