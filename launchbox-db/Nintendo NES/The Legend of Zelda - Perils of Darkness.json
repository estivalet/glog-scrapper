{"name": "The Legend of Zelda: Perils of Darkness", "overview": "This hack is truly a brand new Zelda\u2122 experience and one that is unrecognizable next to the original game. This hack had a lot of thought put into every aspect of it. Months of editing, testing, and revising have been put into this project, as this is the final Zelda 1 hack that will be released by The3Dude. Because of this, he poured his heart out for this final Zelda hack, so that it can truly outshine his other hacks.<br><br>MAJOR NOTE - This hack is very non-linear, as the dungeons are not numbered in quest 1. The dungeons can be beaten in numerous random orders. Any region can be explored from the start, and players can get a good advantage early on by venturing to certain areas first. The second quest is the total opposite and is entirely linear. There is no possible way to beat the dungeons out of order. Just know that if Darknuts or Wizzrobes are seen in the beginning, then save that dungeon for after the others. Play wisely, exploration is rewarded.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "February 20, 2022", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "The3Dude", "publishers": "Romhacking.net", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162766"}
