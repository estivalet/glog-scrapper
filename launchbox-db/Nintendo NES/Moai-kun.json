{"name": "Moai-kun", "overview": "Moai Kun (\u30e2\u30a2\u30a4\u304f\u3093 Mr. Moai?) is a puzzle video game developed and published by Konami for the Family Computer in Japan in March 1990. The game derives its themes from Easter Island; the player controls a sentient moai statue that must rescue other moai and escape each stage via a door before the timer expires. Although platforming elements are present, the primary challenge is to find a way to manipulate the objects in each stage to reach the distressed moai and rescue them while still leaving an avenue of escape to the exit door.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "March 9, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.07", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NgaUd4fxLU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27450"}
