{"name": "Plasma Ball", "overview": "The game is a versus action game focused around manipulating a ball around for various objectives. When you start the game, you get to choose between three Zones (ie. objectives): Arena of Death has you trying to hit the other player with the ball, Building Breaker has you trying to take down enemy-colored buildings by knocking the ball into them many times, and Goal Shoot-out is a 3v3 (2 CPUs on each team) soccer-esque mode where the goal is to shoot the ball into the enemy goal.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "March 27, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jaleco", "publishers": "Jaleco", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCIMlSpG2HI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83749"}
