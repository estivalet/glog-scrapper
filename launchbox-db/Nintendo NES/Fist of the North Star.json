{"name": "Fist of the North Star", "overview": "Fist of the North Star is a side-scrolling action game developed by Shouei System for the Nintendo Entertainment System, originally released in Japan by Toei Animation in 1987 and in North America by Taxan in 1989. The game is based on the manga series Fist of the North Star and is the second of four games based on the franchise that were released for the Family Computer in Japan and the only one with an overseas version. The game's plot is adapted from the second anime series, Hokuto no Ken 2, and covers the Gento K\u014dken story arc. The North American version is simply titled Fist of the North Star and is not to be confused with the original Hokuto no Ken for the Famicom, which was released exclusively in Japan. Despite being based on Hokuto no Ken 2, the North American cover artwork depicts Kenshiro fighting against Toki, who appears only in the first anime series.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "April 17, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Shouei System", "publishers": "Taxan", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.38", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqYxywcx6No", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1252"}
