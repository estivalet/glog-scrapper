{"name": "Mario Adventure", "overview": "This Super Mario Brothers 3 hack changes the game right down to the core by tweaking the actual game engine itself!<br><br>Aside from the \u2018typical\u2019 graphics and text changes, this hack alters musical melodies, a full line up of all new levels, new power ups, new abilities for Mario, and even new enemies! When I say new, I\u2019m not talking about changed graphics; I\u2019m talking about completely new power ups and monsters. Money mushrooms, invisible Mario, time stopping potions, Kuribo shoes in any level that don\u2019t disappear, shy guys that create projectiles, heat seeking bullet bills, and others are just the beginning of the changes made to this game.<br><br>On top of that, you have random weather patterns on every stage, boss battles on every stage, and infinite lives, so your coins go to more useful purposes. They will be used to buy items from Toad\u2019s house and get some level exits to appear. Let\u2019s not forget stored, and switchable, power ups such as those found in Super Mario World!", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "2004", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "DahrkDaiz", "publishers": "", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.6", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/81857"}
