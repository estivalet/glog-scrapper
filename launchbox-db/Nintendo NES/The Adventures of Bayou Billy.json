{"name": "The Adventures of Bayou Billy", "overview": "Your best girl Annabelle has been kidnapped by the evil Gordon, the \"gangster king of Bourbon Street\", and as Bayou Billy it is your job to get her back! Bayou Billy is an arcade action game with three different types of gameplay: fighting, shooting, and driving. The fighting sections take place in both swamps and cities, where you can punch, kick, and jump kick the numerous enemies (and swamp creatures!) you will encounter. The shooting section can be played with either the NES Zapper or the controller. You have a limited amount of ammo to get through the level, and if you run out of it you lose a life. In the driving section your jeep is armed with machine guns and grenades to help get past the many enemy vehicles on the way to your destination. There is a total of nine levels, or you can play in the practice mode which lets you choose to play a fighting, shooting, or driving round individually.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "August 12, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.18", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUZcbojyLBs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/309"}
