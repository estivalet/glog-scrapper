{"name": "The Legend of Zelda: Modern Classic Edition", "overview": "This hack updates the entire The Legend of Zelda game to match the look of more (relatively) modern Zelda games, particularly the Oracle series. With the exception of a few background tiles in dungeons, every tile has been updated including enemies, items and bosses. However, nothing has been moved or had its behavior changed, and all of the graphic changes are simply updates (as opposed to replacements).<br><br>A few text changes have been made to the title to make the items match most Zelda continuity (for example: Red Ring is now Red Tunic, Magical Sword is now Master Sword, etc.) No in-game text has been changed.<br><br>Many the dungeons have been re-colored so that each has its own color scheme (rather than have 2 gold dungeons, 2 grey ones, etc.). For example: Level 8 (The Forest Dungeon) is now green while Level 5 (The Mountain Dungeon) is brown. Level 2 (The Moon Dungeon) is purple(?).<br><br>The Automap Plus from snarfblam has been thrown in. This is the only functional change (improvement) to the game.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "April 12, 2013", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Fantendo", "publishers": "Fantendo", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162871"}
