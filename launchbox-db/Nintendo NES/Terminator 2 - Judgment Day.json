{"name": "Terminator 2: Judgment Day", "overview": "It comes from the future. It can take any shape and survive almost any injury (even when a 10-gauge shotgun blast opens it up like a tin can). Its mission: eliminate John Connor. Its name: the T-1000. Against it stands one hope: you, a terminator model T-800... equipped with on-screen target search displays, a lever-action Winchester, and 10 barrels of high explosives... one mean machine. Protect John Connor (before a 23,000 lb. tow-rig plows your Harley into tomorrow). Save humanity (while Uzi-armed SWAT teams try to blow you away). Terminate the T-1000 (steel mill meltdown!)... or mankind is history.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "February 1, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Software Creations Ltd.", "publishers": "LJN", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.68", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2030"}
