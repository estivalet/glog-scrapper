{"name": "Lei Dian Huang Bi Ka Qiu Chuan Shuo", "overview": "This game is basically a port of Pok\u00e9mon FireRed/LeafGreen Version and Pok\u00e9mon Yellow Version mixed together with some changes to it. It appears to be ported with FireRed & LeafGreen in mind (all the attacks, the TM/HM list, and the types (Magnemite and Magneton are Electric/Steel and Dark moves exist) although almost all the Sevii Islands weren't kept) but reworked to match Yellow's storyline. However, the intro involving catching Pikachu is missing and Pikachu just acts like any normal Pok\u00e9mon. The overworld graphics primarily use FireRed & LeafGreen graphics with some graphics from Pok\u00e9mon Ruby/Sapphire Version and the Game Boy port of Harvest Moon as well.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "January 29, 2004", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Shenzhen Nanjing Technology", "publishers": "Shenzhen Nanjing Technology", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPd6RLs1_zs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/77746"}
