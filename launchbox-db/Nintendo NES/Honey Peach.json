{"name": "Honey Peach", "overview": "Honey Peach (also known as Mein\u00fc Quan) is a very simple rock-paper-scissors game in which the player competes against several increasingly skillful female opponents. The screen displays two hands, each representing a competitor, rapidly closing and opening fists. The goal is to press one of the three buttons corresponding to rock, paper, and scissors at the right time, stopping the movement and displaying the results. The women undress in three stages; the game is lost if the player has lost six times to the same woman.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sachen", "publishers": "Sachen", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpCRQ9F25VI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/71965"}
