{"name": "The Best Play Baseball Simulation Game II", "overview": "The Best Play Pro Baseball II (Best Play Pro Yakyuu II) is a baseball game developed by ASCII Entertainment for the Famicom, and published in Japan in 1990. It is the sequel to Best Play Pro Baseball. Unlike similar baseball games developed for the Famicom, this game has a particular emphasis on baseball management simulation, as opposed to focusing on the skill of playing baseball. As a result, players do not actually hit, pitch, or field the ball. Rather, their interaction in the game is accomplished by changing lineups and alternating pitchers and fielders in order to give your team the best chance it has in winning a league pennant race.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "March 30, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "ASCII Entertainment", "publishers": "Ascii Entertainment", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.79", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/26834"}
