{"name": "Arctic", "overview": "Arctic is an action puzzle game that describes itself as \"active rail playing\". Each of more than two-dozen stages consists of a set of rails in various arrangements, often looping around each other and splitting in various directions. Each stage contains a number of colored balls which begin in corresponding slots, and after launching them the goal is to return the balls to the matching-colored slots. The only interaction the player has with the board is switching two sets of splits; there are yellow and blue splits, which will redirect any balls moving through them, and the player can only turn all of one color as a group. Many stages also contain bumpers and gates which will affect the speed and direction of the balls. Completing a puzzle often requires strategic use of the stage's features to bounce balls onto the correct paths.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "February 23, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Artdink Corporation", "publishers": "Pony Canyon, Inc.", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.77", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_N_M6CL1NQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/26523"}
