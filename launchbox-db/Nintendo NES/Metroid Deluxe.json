{"name": "Metroid Deluxe", "overview": "From the author: \u201cThis is a 100% complete patch: Most of the map was totally deleted so the game was built again from scratch. Items are moved, puzzles are changed, and there is no such thing as a dead end. It is hard both mentally and physically, but I avoided such design flaws as having to bomb arbitrary points in the floor or placing enemies so that you get smacked in the face on the way in or out of rooms. Metroid fans should love this! It\u2019s essentially a brand new NES Metroid game. Also, minor text and graphics hacks were done, but mostly just for packaging purposes, (As in, the title screen was changed, mostly). If you like Metroid at all, you should pick this up!\u201d", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "The Rooser", "publishers": "", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/129939"}
