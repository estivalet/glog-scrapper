That's jungle combat as you saw it in the movie Platoon. Now, Sunsoft's Platoon takes you right into the action. You'll fight for your life against deadly guerillas and hidden snipers, always on guard against the booby traps and napalm airstrikes that could end it all in an instant.

You've got it right in the palm of your hand.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 1, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sun Electronics", "publishers": "Sun Corporation of America", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.59", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1908"}
