{"name": "Cosmo Police Galivan", "overview": "Cosmo Police Galivan puts the player in control of a human being armed with a beam blade, which is only able to attack monsters in close proximity. As the game continues, the player character can use different powers - some ranged - to take out enemies and progress further. Eventually, the player will have the option of becoming a metal-armored officer with considerably more fire-power, though this power-up state will vanish if too much damage is taken. The player character will also level-up after destroying so many enemies, improving their health and \"cosmo points\" - a stat similar to mana that is used to power the player character's special attacks.<br><br>The game's world is a network of caves that the player can explore for necessary items and bonus areas. The NES version expands this aspect, providing some Metroidvania-esque exploration. Some impediments are in place to restrict further exploration until the right item is found, as well.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "June 3, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nihon Bussan Co., Ltd.", "publishers": "Nihon Bussan Co., Ltd.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.11", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2wVjOwjtN8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/22903"}
