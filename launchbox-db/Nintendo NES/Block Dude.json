{"name": "Block Dude", "overview": "This is a port of the TI-83 (and other calcs) puzzle game Block Dude. In the game, you control Block Dude, whose powers are to pick up and put down one block at a time. He can also climb one block at a time! Using the blocks, you make your way to the door which brings you to the next level. The original was created by Brandon Sterner and can be found here. There are also great emulators if you don't have the calculator yourself. OR if you have a way to play NES roms, you can play this port :)", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "September 13, 2018", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mitch3a", "publishers": "Mitch3a", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151072"}
