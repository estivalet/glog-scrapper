{"name": "The Immortal", "overview": "The Immortal is an isometric game with puzzle-solving and action combat. Progress is made by encountering a hazard, dying, solving the problem, encountering the next hazard. To solve a level, you have to know its traps and their patterns by heart. The puzzles range from simple avoidance of traps to the correct use of items; you collect objects in an inventory. Every now and then, the game offers a special challenge. For example, you've got to ride a magic carpet through a hallway full of fire traps, or ride a barrel on an underground river.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "November 1, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sandcastle", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.12", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2631"}
