{"name": "Route-16 Turbo", "overview": "Route-16 Turbo is an updated version of an older arcade game entitled Route 16, developed jointly by Tehkan (later Tecmo) and Sunsoft (in a manner similar to the way Namco's Warpman is an updated version of Warp & Warp.) Route-16 Turbo takes the concept established in Route 16, and updates the quality of the graphics, but keeps the goal of the game the same. The game play is a near perfect combination of Rally-X and Venture. The player drives a car through several zoomed in blocks collecting bags of money and other items, and travels between blocks along a zoomed out view of the world.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "October 4, 1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sunsoft", "publishers": "Sunsoft", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.79", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOA6ToFTDMo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27500"}
