{"name": "Batman III", "overview": "A hack of the Batman Returns ROM, this is a side-scrolling beat 'em up. Next to brawling action game Batman has to defeat a large number of enemies (members of the Penguin's circus gang) to advance. Possible attacks include punches, sliding attacks, drop kicks and a powerful 360\u00b0 cape slash attack which will drain Batman's health bar. Gadgets to be used include a limited number of batarangs and a grappling hook. The hook is useful for many things: it can take down flying enemies, pull Batman up to higher levels, lets him climb into open windows and more. Hidden in background items somewhere in the levels are power-ups, including hearts that refill the health bar and extra batarangs.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.06", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EsdKgx_xhs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/130274"}
