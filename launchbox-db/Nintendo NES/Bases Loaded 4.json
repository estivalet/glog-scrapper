The game featured slightly more elaborate animations than its predecessor, and much larger fielders. Removed was the goal to play a flawless game; instead the game featured more traditional modes, including exhibition games and full season play.<br><br>Geared more toward faced-paced arcade gameplay than simulation, Bases Loaded 4 was not licensed by Major League Baseball or the Major League Baseball Players' Association. Therefore, it did not feature real American (or Japanese, for that matter) teams or players.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "November 21, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "TOSE", "publishers": "Jaleco", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.26", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRIRwqpum-M", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1574"}
