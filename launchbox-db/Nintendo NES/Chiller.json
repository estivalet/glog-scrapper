{"name": "Chiller", "overview": "A player's goal is to shoot everything that there is on the screen, both animated characters (ghosts, zombies, humans) and inanimate elements of the background. There are four unique screens detailing various horror scenarios and settings, a torture chamber, a rack room, a hallway and a cemetery. For each screen, shooting all available targets gives the player a bonus shooting round. The game features a Ghost counter on-screen scoring system named the \"Ectoplasmic Tabulator\". It has very similar gameplay to \"Crossbow\" and other related Exidy 440 board system games.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "American Game Cartridges", "publishers": "American Game Cartridges", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.61", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1213"}
