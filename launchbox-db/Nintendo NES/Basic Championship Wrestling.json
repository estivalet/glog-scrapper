Though it doesn\u2019t say so, your CPU will do maneuvers to you that you don\u2019t have the option to do including hitting you with a trash can or spitting mist in your face.<br><br>The game plays a bit like paper-rock-scissors.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "2017", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Chris Dietrich", "publishers": "pacnsacdave", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnKgk36aFvU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151057"}
