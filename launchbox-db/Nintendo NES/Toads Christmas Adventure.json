{"name": "Toads Christmas Adventure", "overview": "Santa\u2019s evil brother has stolen Toad\u2019s little sister (Toadette) and toad\u2019s gift! You have to play though the frozen North Pole of the Mushroom Kingdom to save them!<br><br>TCA is a hack featuring level changes, animation, and a bunch of assembly hacks to change the game into something new. This hack has the same level of difficulty as the original Super Mario Bros, and I do hope you can enjoy it without savestates.<br><br>There is a catch however, since it is only a short game (4 levels) you only start off with one life. However, there are lives scattered though all 4 levels.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "December 23, 2008", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Darkdata", "publishers": "hack (Clay Cowgill)", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/115967"}
