{"name": "Bases Loaded", "overview": "Pitch, hit and run like the pros! Here's voice, action and graphics so real, you'll believe you're in the lineup. The characters look like real baseball players, not cartoons. The action moves at the same pace as a real game. Sounds real, too! The crack of the bat, the calls of the ump, the roar of the crowd when you score. Play against the computer or a friend. Pick your team from 12 different lineups. It's tough. Each team has 30 players - 12 pitchers and 18 fielders. Each ballplayer has his own style. The trick: learn all 360 players! Control and play any position. Whether pitching or at bat, control every aspect of the game. Throw a fastball, high outside or a slider. Swing for the fences. Hit and run, bunt, steal or call for a pinch hitter. Win the Pennant by storing your wins and losses.
