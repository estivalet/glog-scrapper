{"name": "Super Cartridge Ver 5: 7 in 1", "overview": "The Super Cartridge series is a series of nine multicarts for the Famicom and NES made by Sachen. These compilations are notable for containing the vast majority of the Sachen library (inlcuding the Joy Van titles) in their latest revision as well as some unique games not released standalone. They seem to originate from the mid 90s as they only feature games made before 1993 with the exceptions of the titles exclusives to those multicarts. They do not contain any of the later Sachen titles, likely to not compete with their single releases.<br><br>Super Cartridge Version 5: 7-in-1: Penguin and Seal, Middle School English, Pyramid, Magical Mathematics, Strategist (which itself contains Poker Racing and The Battle of Poker), Olympic I.Q., Chinese Checkers.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sachen", "publishers": "Sachen", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBwjDJO1gqg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83799"}
