{"name": "Pipe Dream", "overview": "What are you supposed to do with 7 simple pieces of pipe and 8 weird ones?  All you have to do is build them into a pipeline that's no more complicated than the average oil refinery.  But that's the easy part.  Seconds after you put the first pipe in place, this sticky, slimey stuff called flooz starts flowing through it.  From that point on, it's you against the flooz.  But you've got four powerful weapons.  Your right hand.  Your left hand.  Your brain.  And your left brain.  So what are your chances of out-smarting the flooz?  Nobody knows for sure.  But at last count, there were 14,567,984,176 ways to dream up a better pipeline.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "September 1, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Distinctive Software", "publishers": "Bullet-Proof Software", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.91", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v331HRNdAkY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1906"}
