{"name": "190-in-1", "overview": "Despite the multicart's claim, only 42 games are actually included. The menu system is unorthodox, with the first 15 games on the first page leading to the other pages which can be accessed by pressing the Select button. Like some Supervision multicarts, the menu music is taken from Booby Kids. The graphics are taken from the Magic Jewelry hack that's included among the games.<br><br>Unlike most multicarts where the repeats have random letters added on to the end, this multicart uses alternate names such as Luigi Bros and Zero Wing. (The latter of which is not the Mega Drive game of the same name) The memory is likely all stored in PRG format, as the games take about 3 seconds to load when picked.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Supervision", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGEzlxfaquQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/142583"}
