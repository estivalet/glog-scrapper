{"name": "Koko Adventure", "overview": "Koko Adventure (\ucf54\ucf54 \uc5b4\ub4dc\ubca4\uccd0) is a Famicom platform game developed by Open Corp. in 1993. It is one of the few games for the Famicom that was developed in South Korea. This game was better well-known as its unreleased, American version known as Buzz & Waldog.<br><br>The game stars two characters, Koko and Suzi, who shares the same abilities. You can either play as either one in single player or both in multiplayer. There's 3 levels in each stage as well as a boss fight. There's 5 stages overall and after that, you fight all the bosses again before confronting the final boss. There's also question mark boxes around that you can break to get points, gems, a time increase, 1-ups or a power-up. The power-up can either grant you the ability to double jump and if you already have that, the ability to let you glide in the air.<br><br>Koko Adventure was later changed and was supposed to be released by Innovation Technology in 1993 but due to unknown reasons, it never was along with some of Open Corp.'s other games. In this version, Suzi is replaced with a male character known as Waldog and the title screen was changed. (although her name remains on the game over screen through cheating/hacking). That version also features infinite lives, which was likely intended for debugging and testing.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "May 1, 1993", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Open Corp", "publishers": "Daou Infosys", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb9KXViuILg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/68546"}
