{"name": "L.A Cop: Miss. Peach World", "overview": "Miss Peach World 1: Super L.A. Cop. is a pornographic hack of Menace Beach released by Hacker International in 1991 for the Famicom.<br> <br> This hack changes the majority of the graphics. Scooter has been changed to \"Miss Peach\", a woman with a white dress who is based on Marilyn Monroe. Demon Dan is now Janky Takamitsu, a mad scientist with a syringe. All of the other enemies and objects have been changed. For example, Wan Ka Pow is now a mafia member known as Maron Brond and Pelvis becoming a tribal person known as Mr. Sankon. The majority of the music has been changed to a track from AV Dragon Mahjong. The cutscenes are also changed to two girls with their clothes rotting away between levels, eventually becoming nude. The text for the cutscenes are all in Japanese but oddly enough, it's written out in r\u014dmaji. This is possibly due to Color Dreams not willing to implement the Japanese alphabet.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Color Dreams", "publishers": "Hacker International", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.62", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQ_LOnNSS94&spfreload=10", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86375"}
