{"name": "Journey to the West", "overview": "The story begins with an introduction to Sun Wukong and its story before the Journey to the West. He then provides an introductory story for Xuanzang, the main character in Journey to the West, and the Buddha's instruction for Guanyin, where he must find someone to carry the Buddhist sutras back to the east. Xuanzang was chosen for the task of bringing the Buddhist sutras from the West to the east. Guanyin also traveled to find bodyguards for Xuanzang to follow him west. All the companions agreed to serve Xuanzang as a way to atone for past sins. Sun Wukong was the first disciple to join the journey, although his violence was constantly reprimanded by Xuanzang. There are two menus in this game. The first menu is which character to start with, but it's not too important since you can change the character during the game. The second menu appears when you have lost all your lives and have to continue.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "TXC Corp", "publishers": "Micro Genius", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZbBjGgV_X8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83618"}
