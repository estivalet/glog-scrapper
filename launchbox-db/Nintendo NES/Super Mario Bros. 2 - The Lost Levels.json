{"name": "Super Mario Bros. 2: The Lost Levels", "overview": "A Port made by fans to NES console. The story of Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels is identical to the first game and is said to be set in a \"parallel world\" to it. The game is divided into 13 new worlds of the Mushroom Kingdom, each of which have four levels like in Super Mario Bros. Mario and Luigi have to get to the end of the level by jumping over various gaps and avoiding or defeating the members of the Koopa Troop on their way. The Mario Bros. can use several platforms (some of them collapse when Mario or Luigi lands on them), stairs in the level, as well as Jumping Boards. There are also Warp Pipes along the way, some of which Mario can enter to visit various secret coin rooms before returning to the level, a bit further ahead than when he left. At the end of each level, a castle stands with a flagpole nearby. When Mario reaches the flagpole, he takes down the enemy flag and enters the castle, completing the level. The higher the spot that Mario hits the flagpole, the more points he receives.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "June 3, 1986", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nintendo R&D4", "publishers": "", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.59", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqU_SuCA5dc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/124886"}
