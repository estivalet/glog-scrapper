{"name": "Fire 'n Ice", "overview": "In this game, players control Dana. The goal of each stage is to put out all the fires. The fires are extinguished by either kicking an ice block into the flame, or dropping one from above. Dana's moveset includes the abilities to walk left and right across level ground. He can also climb on top of a solid block to his left or right, provided it is only one block tall and there is nothing on top of it. Dana can also push blocks of ice, which will then slide until they fall or hit a wall. Dana's most important ability is his ice magic. He can create and destroy blocks of ice. As the gameplay is grid-based, Dana's ice magic affects the squares beneath him and to the left and right, similar to Lode Runner. If the ice block is placed horizontally adjacent to a wall, pipe, jar, or another ice block, it will freeze to the adjacent surface.<br><br>There are also other elements that are introduced as the player progresses, including pipes (which Dana can travel through) and jars. Dana can walk across normal jars, but once a jar comes in contact with a flame, it begins to burn. Dana cannot walk across the top of burning jars, and any ice that is created in, or enters the square above a burning jar is destroyed. As players progress, the puzzles get more complicated and difficult. The simple gameplay must be used in new ways by players who wish to complete the game.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "March 11, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tecmo", "publishers": "Tecmo", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.12", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ll6cMyWnHN4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/19477"}
