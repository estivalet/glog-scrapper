But you\u2019re not the kind of dragon to just sit in a cave and pout in your old eggshell. Your wings haven\u2019t grown out yet, but you\u2019re ready for anything. Use your feet to jump over boulders, run through the deep forest, and navigate the castle maze to the top of the great castle where the white knight makes his lair.<br><br>You won\u2019t be alone. Behind mysterious doors lurk other monsters. They will give you strange items and cryptic clues to help you in your quest. You won\u2019t go hungry either. Fry a knight with your dragon breath, you can eat what\u2019s left.<br><br>So don\u2019t let this fairy tale end the way it does in the storybooks! Use your dragon\u2019s breath to fry up some side-scrolling 8-bit justice!", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "June 15, 2012", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "64KB Games", "publishers": "64KB Games", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSAg9R6PL1M", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151519"}
