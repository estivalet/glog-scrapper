{"name": "English Word Blaster", "overview": "Zhongshan Subor Educational Electronics Company (Subor) has made a name for themselves in many circles, thanks to the large variety of interesting Famiclones they managed to produce over the years. In addition to several generic Famiclones that are not worth mentioning, Subor made whole computer packages comprised of disk drives, keyboards and the works. One of Subor\u2019s machines was emulator-based and contained a built-in SD Drive, which allowed gamers to load roms from their memory cards directly into the machine. Few are aware, however, that Subor also had exclusive software designed for use with its large array of pseudo-computer Famiclones. That is what I want to discuss today.<br><br>One of the most popular themes in educational software has to do with the learning of foreign languages. Just as Americans can purchase dozens of budget PC titles promising to teach the buyers how to speak French or Spanish, English software was the rage during the 80s and 90s. In Japan, Nintendo released a Popeye English game, and Sachen\u2019s Middle School English was another English-based game. Subor would also follow suit, and one of their products was English Word Blaster.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Subor", "publishers": "", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvciq3TP90", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/115818"}
