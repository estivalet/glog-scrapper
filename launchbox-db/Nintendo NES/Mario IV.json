{"name": "Mario IV", "overview": "Mario IV (aka Super Mario Bros. 4) is a hack of Armadillo released some time in the early 1990s.<br><br>The main differences with Mario IV include a different title screen and the main character being replaced by Mario. Some of the graphics were taken from from Dian Shi Ma Li and Super Mario Bros. 3. An alternate version of the hack has a stage select that allows the player to start from any one of the 8 worlds.<br><br>Mario IV's origin is unknown. It is possible that it shares a developer with 7 Grand Dad, due to Mario IV's numerous releases having an nearly identical PCB to said game. It is also somewhat hinted that the J.Y. Company released it at some point.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Fortyfive", "publishers": "J.Y.
