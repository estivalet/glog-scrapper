{"name": "8-Bit Xmas 2014", "overview": "There's nothing more emblematic of the Holiday seasons than the cozy feeling you get waking to a fire and conifer brimming under with presents. That feeling of togetherness and warmth and holiday spirit shared while singing songs of the season with friends and family. That feeling of dominating your friends until they throw the controller at your TV. Ah, such memories! <br><br>This year's game puts 2 teams of 3 players against each other in a crazy battle. It is the first ever simultaneous 6 player NES game! Multiple player types and many goals for victory keep the action going and make your friends want to keep playing. 4 player games require the Four Score, and 6 player games require two Power Pads. If you have a working ROB, a title screen option commands him to dance to the XMAS music.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "2014", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "RetroZone", "publishers": "Retrozone", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "6", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/76434"}
