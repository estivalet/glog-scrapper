{"name": "Akuma-kun: Makai no Wana", "overview": "Based on a popular manga, the game follows Akuma-kun, who the player controls, through three different types of areas. The world map allows Akuma-kun to visit different towns and dungeons. The world map is in an overhead perspective and features random encounters, which pit Akuma-kun against randomly appearing enemies. During battles, the perspective switches to first-person and the player selects different types of attacks from a menu. During battle, the player can summon demons to aid Akuma-kun with fighting. The player's party and the enemies then take turns attacking each other, similar to most other turn-based RPGs. When Akuma-kun enters a town, the view switches to that of a side-scrolling video game. By moving up at certain areas, Akuma-kun can enter buildings and shops.<br><br>The game begins as a wizard explains to Akuma-kun that the world will be a better place if demons and humans establish contact. Akuma-kun then sets out to establish this connection.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "February 24, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "TOSE", "publishers": "Bandai", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF2iDF90py4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/26657"}
