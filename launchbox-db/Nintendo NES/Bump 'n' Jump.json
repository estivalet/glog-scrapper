{"name": "Bump 'n' Jump", "overview": "You're cruising along with your baby, Bunny, in your Buggy, when from behind you hear this brain-boggling b-b-baroooooom! It's Dark Jackal and his beastly band of Blacktop Bullies! They buzz by and when the smoke clears, the passenger seat's bare. These dudes have kidnapped your baby, Bunny!<br><br>Only you and the Buggy can bring her back. But not without a bone-bouncing chase that makes the Indy 500 look like bumper cars. Over jam-packed city streets and treacherous curves on mountain cliffs, past Dark Jackal's Bullies to catch his Buggy and Bunny. And the cops are bearing down on you from behind. Think you got what it takes to save Bunny?", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "October 8, 1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "SAS Sakata", "publishers": "Vic Tokai", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.51", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtube.com/watch?v=IAPXIJhyevM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1015"}
