{"name": "Days of Thunder -Unreleased Version-", "overview": "IT'S DAYS OF THUNDER AS YOU'VE NEVER SEEN IT BEFORE!<br><br>This is the original Days of Thunder for the NES! This game was created internally at Mindscape and was quietly cancelled in 1990, replaced by a completely different version of the game made at Beam Software in Australia.<br><br>This version of the game was never seen by the public, never shown at a trade show, and never previewed by a magazine. Outside of the staff at Mindscape, it's likely that nobody has ever played this game before.<br><br>In 1990, the game was archived by its late co-creator, Chris Oberth, on a set of floppy disks kept in his personal archives. 30 years later, those disks were discovered by his family and, using Mindscape's original development tools, the game was rebuilt!", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "June 2, 2020", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "", "developers": "Mindscape", "publishers": "Video Game History Foundation", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C49fFQt2K1I", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/132107"}
