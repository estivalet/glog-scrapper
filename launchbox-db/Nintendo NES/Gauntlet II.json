{"name": "Gauntlet II", "overview": "The gameplay is very similar to the original Gauntlet, a topdown dungeon crawl supporting up to four players. The biggest difference from the original game is that players can choose identical classes, instead of being limited to a particular one for each joystick; the players being differentiated by colors. Thus, instead of having a \"warrior\", \"wizard\", and \"valkyrie\" (for instance), in Gauntlet II there could be a \"red wizard\", a \"blue elf\" and a \"green warrior\".", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "September 1, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atari", "publishers": "Mindscape", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.66", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1739"}
