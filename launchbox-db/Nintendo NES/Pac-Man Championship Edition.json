{"name": "Pac-Man Championship Edition", "overview": "The NES Pac-Man Championship Edition was originally a demake port by Japanese homebrew developer coke774. When Namco got ahold of it for the officially-licensed Namcot Collection (and Namco Museum Archives Vol. 1), development was shifted to M2, who altered a number of aspects from coke774's original. The initial homebrew version was never released to the public, though a handful of emulator-recorded screenshots and videos have surfaced, giving an incomplete look at the alterations M2 made.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "June 18, 2020", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "M2 Co., Ltd.", "publishers": "Bandai Namco Entertainment", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.86", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzR2JeWF5iI&ab_channel=ArcadeUSA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/139360"}
