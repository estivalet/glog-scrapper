{"name": "Bakushou!! Jinsei Gekijou 2", "overview": "Bakushou!! Jinsei Gekijou 2 is a board game, during which you follow the lives of up to 4 characters. The game is best played as multiplayer, but you can also allow the computer to play for other characters, or create all of them on your own. In the game, you are presented with a board which is composed of tiles. A roll of dice determines the amount of steps a character will take on the board. Depending on the tile he steps on, different events will occur. If the tile is empty, a random event will happen. Other tiles are connected to a certain aspect of a person's life. For example, \"learning\" tiles will trigger an event that will make the character more intelligent (like studying for the school), and a tile with a \"love\" icon will lead to a romantic encounter and raise the love level of the character.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "March 22, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "C-Lab", "publishers": "Taito", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73887"}
