{"name": "Gun.Smoke", "overview": "Gun.Smoke is very similar to Commando, another Capcom game, but with several differences. Whereas Commando is a run and gun game, this game is a scrolling shooter in which the screen scrolls upward automatically and players only have three ways to shoot, using three buttons for left, right, and center shooting. However, a player can also change the way the gunman shoots through button combinations. A player can still die by getting shot or struck by enemies like in Commando but improve protection by getting special items, including a horse, for protection up to three hits; boots, for speed of movement; bullets, for faster shots; and rifles, for shot length. These items are found by shooting barrels and rifles, boots, and bullets can stock up to five.", "platform": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "release_date": "February 1, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Capcom", "publishers": "Capcom", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.02", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCf9ch6fY10", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1265"}
