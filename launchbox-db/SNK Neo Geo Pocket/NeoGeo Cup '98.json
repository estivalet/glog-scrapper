{"name": "NeoGeo Cup '98", "overview": "Neo Geo Cup '98 is a football/soccer game for the Neo Geo Pocket. This version is different from Neo Geo Cup '98: The Road to the Victory - here playing field is vertical-scrolling, not side-scrolling. The game has less national teams than the bigger version - the player can choose one from 16 teams. Neo Geo Cup '98 is an unofficial adaptation of the World Cup - SNK has made a fictional Neo Geo Cup. Gameplay is quite simple; the player controls a football team and must win matches against rival teams. The game uses simple \"2-buttons and stick\" controls (limits of the Neo Geo Pocket).", "platform": "SNK Neo Geo Pocket", "release_date": "October 28, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "SNK", "publishers": "SNK", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.45", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLEHlCboj8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/28085\n"}
