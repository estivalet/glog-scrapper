The player operates a fighter robot which must dodge missiles fired by mechanical dragons while returning the fire. The idea is to move the robot to the right or left and fire missiles at the dragons or UFO. One robot is knocked out of the game if it is hit by fire from a dragon, or if a dragon is allowed to move all the way to the base of the screen. Game ends when all three robots have been lost. Each time you score 10,000 points during the game, an additional robot will be provided as a bonus. If the dragon is hit in the head, the entire image will be knocked off the screen, giving a point score of the number of remaining torsos times ten, plus the number of points for the head.
