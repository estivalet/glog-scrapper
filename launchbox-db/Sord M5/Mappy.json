{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mappy", "overview": "You control Mappy, a police-mouse whose job is to collect valuables (consumer electronics) from a cat's house. You are being pursued by a gang of five pink cats. Doors are your only defense against the cats. You get from floor to floor by jumping on one of the trampolines. Points are earned by recovering stolen goods. Other ways of earning points are bouncing on a trampoline, putting cats in the microwave, striking a cat with a door, striking cats with a bell, retrieving a treasure from the Boss cat Goro or dropping cats through a hole in the floor.", "platform": "Sord M5", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Namco", "publishers": "Takara", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "0.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mappy", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvA2-11xYLQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/131918-mappy\n"}
