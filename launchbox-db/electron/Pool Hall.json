{"name": "Pool Hall", "overview": "Inside the smoke-filled Pool Hall, you carefully line up your cue. Good judgement is essential as you want to avoid being hustled in this game.<br><br>You shoot gently this time, and just kiss the black into the corner pocket. The game is won and you get ready for the next challenger. POOL is a realistic representation of the real thing using super smooth colour graphics for accuracy and detail. You control the cue angle and strength of shot and the computer does the rest together with keeping track of penalty shots and the score.", "platform": "Acorn Electron", "release_date": "May 1, 1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Dynabyte", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/143005"}
