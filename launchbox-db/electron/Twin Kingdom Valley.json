{"name": "Twin Kingdom Valley", "overview": "Twin Kingdom Valley is a graphic text adventure where you will see a picture (with some animation) of your location before seeing a text description of what you can see, any items and any characters in that location. You type in commands to control your player. You can ask to see your score and your strength score. Your strength score is high at the start but not eating or drinking, or being attacked will weaken you and decrease your strength score, but you can wait (if it is safe) to increase it. The aim of the game is to get 1024 points.", "platform": "Acorn Electron", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Trevor Hall", "publishers": "Bug-Byte Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/77265"}
