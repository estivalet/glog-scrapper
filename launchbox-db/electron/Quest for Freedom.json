Touching an alien or poisonous platform depletes your energy.<br><br>The puzzles range from simple to complex. To open a door, which shows which key you need, simply enter the screen with the door, and press the 'use' key (*). The door opens, and the key disappears.<br><br>Some puzzles involve standing on or near objects, and dropping objects near obstacles, but more are solved simply by using the object on the correct screen.", "platform": "Acorn Electron", "release_date": "April 1, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "IJK Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/143050"}
