{"name": "Savage Island: Part One", "overview": "Savage Island is the only multi-part game in Scott Adams' adventure series, all of which have a very similar parser and interface. At the completion of this game, players receive a password which allows part two to be played. The Savage Island games are also probably the most difficult adventures in the series!<br><br>The player begins trapped on a small remote island in the ocean, which is facing a hurricane and also has an active volcano. The player can cross a river, and will also need to explore a cave network. Items are often found by running through the sand with one's hands.<br><br>The island holds a great secret, which will not be discovered until both parts of the game have been completed.", "platform": "Acorn Electron", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Brian Howarth", "publishers": "Adventure International (UK)", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KiVJ5DES_I", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/81709"}
