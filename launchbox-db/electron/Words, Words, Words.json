{"name": "Words, Words, Words", "overview": "A program for young children who are learning to read. Using the program, a child can build up scenes by accurately spelling the names of objects. Once a scene has been correctly completed, things begin to happen; perhaps smoke comes out of the chimney, or a lorry drives off, or the lion may roar.<br><br>There is more to the game though than just learning to spell. A new story can be created each time the program is used, since the scenes can be linked together by the child in any order. After the last scene children may enjoy drawing a picture to describe what they think might happen next.", "platform": "Acorn Electron", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tom Stonier", "publishers": "Acornsoft", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/82068"}
