{"name": "Mineshaft", "overview": "Your aim is to collect all the lumps of coal in the twenty rooms of the Mineshaft. You have to be quick, daring and sometimes near suicidal to accomplish your task, and beware - you only have a limited air supply! The game should be compatible with all joysticks.<br><br>To collect the lumps of coal you will have to move and jump around the screen. Sometimes you must jump whilst also moving sideways. Watch out for the disintegrating sludge which disappears as you walk over it. (Hint: It disintegrates more slowly if you bounce along it!) Watch out for the obstacles that may kill you!<br><br>After completing each screen you may move to the next through the door, or if you get stuck you can press ESCAPE to make your exit. It's up to you to work out how to collect all the lumps of coal - sorry!", "platform": "Acorn Electron", "release_date": "November 1, 1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Julian Todd & Nick Wilson", "publishers": "Alternative Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEafJttOqx8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/81920"}
