{"name": "Sphere of Destiny 2", "overview": "The inter-stellar highway is constructed from brightly coloured tiles. Unfortunately, Bruce the jet-ball is very sensitive, and reacts to different colours in various ways.<br>Blue and Yellow are no problem, but Red slows you right down. Green speeds you up and Magenta makes you bounce, whilst Cyan reverses the controls (Aaagh!). White give a bonus, but avoid the Black holes at all costs!", "platform": "Acorn Electron", "release_date": "January 1, 1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gark Partis", "publishers": "Audiogenic", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pr04bIwtMg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/82042"}
