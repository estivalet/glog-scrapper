{"name": "Croaker", "overview": "The objective in Croaker is to get your family of frogs safely across the busy motorway and over a polluted river into each of the lairs set in the embankment. To do this you must dodge between the traffic, then leap from logs to turtles without falling in.<br><br>When all five lairs have been filled you move onto a higher phase. The roads become busier, some logs turn into crocodiles, and the turtles sometimes dive, making the whole exercise much trickier. You can jump onto a crocodile's back, but beware his jaws!", "platform": "Acorn Electron", "release_date": "July 1, 1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Micro Power", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/142877"}
