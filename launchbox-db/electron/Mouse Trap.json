{"name": "Mouse Trap", "overview": "This platform game challenges the player to guide a mouse around a screen collecting goodies - varying from cheese to cakes to balloons. Once they have all been collected you must reach the door, doing all of this within the time limit, depicted by a picture of a diffusing bomb.<br><br>The player will have to jump over flowers, dodge bouncing balls and dinosaurs amongst other things - contact with any of these loses a life. Movement is achieved along ledges, via clouds, moving platforms and up ladders. Short falls can be withstood, but larger ones (or heavy landings from jumps) are fatal.", "platform": "Acorn Electron", "release_date": "June 1, 1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Tynesoft Computer Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fys4lUWxia4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/142986"}
