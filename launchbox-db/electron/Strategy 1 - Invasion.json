{"name": "Strategy 1: Invasion", "overview": "This is not an arcade game. If you don't want an intellectually challenging strategic wargame to play, put the tape back on the shelf!<br>Invasion places you in command of the land forces of the Western Alliance, just prior to an invasion by the Red's tank armies.<br>You will have to exercise skill and judgement as you move, supply and build up your limited defences to stand any hope of victory. Invasion is a true wargame and you could play all night just to find that the computer's grasp of strategy was superior to yours!<br>Using excellent graphics and with detailed instructions, Strategy 1 is light years beyond the arcade. Isn't it time you stopped being the cannon fodder and took command? This is you chance to see if you're good enough to fight it out at the top!", "platform": "Acorn Electron", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Argus Press", "publishers": "Argus Press Software Ltd.", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/81937"}
