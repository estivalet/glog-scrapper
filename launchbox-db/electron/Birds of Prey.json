{"name": "Birds of Prey", "overview": "A Space Invaders variant in which you are attacked by Swoopers, Kamakazee Birds and Death Bombs. The birds start off in formation, with Swoopers peeling off and attacking, bombing you as they circle. Kamakazee Birds also peel off and home in on you. If they miss they then re-appear at the screen top. You are also attacked by Death Bombs which you must shoot before they reach the bottom, otherwise you lose a life. You start with three lives and gain a bonus one every fourth time that you clear a screen.", "platform": "Acorn Electron", "release_date": "February 16, 1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Clive Webster", "publishers": "Romik", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/150782"}
