Your job is to try and line up the three spcial \"ice-diamond\" blocks without being killed by the \"snow bees\" waiting for you at every turn.<br><br>One way to kill them is to kick the blue ice blocks at them, or alternatively you can entice them on to the fence - now you can electrify the fence by giving it a hefty kick - any bees on the fence will now be stunned, long enough for you to run over them and finish them off!<br><br>If you can avoid the bees long enough to try and line up the special \"ice diamond\" blocks (the white ones) then you are rewarded with bonus points; 10,000 for the blocks in the middle of the field, 5,000 points if on the fence.", "platform": "Acorn Electron", "release_date": "January 10, 1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Visions", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/143054"}
