{"name": "Triple Decker 6", "overview": "Cavern Capers<br><br>You have been given command of a spaceship. Your mission is to escape from heavily defended underground caverns. Your ship is a short range craft, so in order to stay aloft you must explode fuel tanks with your powerful lasers. To add to your problems, the caverns become more treacherous to pass through as you continue.<br><br>Snap Dragon<br><br>King Fred (The Thick!) has decreed that jousting and other similar fighting be outlawed.<br><br>Instead, Knights must settle their disputes by playing Snap. But this is no ordinary game of Snap. Every time a Knight wins, the door of his dragon's cage is opened a little. When the door is completely open, then that dragon's owner is the winner, and everyone celebrates with a feast of barbecued dragon!<br><br>Castle of Sand<br><br>The object of the game is to fill in the sand castle with sand from the beach. The sand is advancing slowly towards the bottom of the screen and any sand it meets is slowly washed away. But don't worry, the sea cannot wash away your castle.<br><br>You must position your man above or below the sand you wish to dig then pick it up in your bucket. When you drop the sand it fills in the space directly above you. You score 25 points for each block placed in the castle.", "platform": "Acorn Electron", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Alternative Software", "publishers": "Alternative Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lk6hs7hqRY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/81844"}
