Only superb riding skills and a steady throwing arm can get you through your seven day week of hilarious action. Avoid cars, workmen, drunkards and lawnmowers all out to obstruct you in your pursuit of excellence. Score points by delivering to all your usual customers, but you can get sneaky bonuses by breaking the windows of non-subscribers.<br><br>It's a difficult task but your employer believes that practice makes perfect and generously provides a practice track where you can score valuable extra points. Get ready for the ride of your life.", "platform": "Acorn Electron", "release_date": "May 1, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Elite", "publishers": "Elite", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/143038"}
