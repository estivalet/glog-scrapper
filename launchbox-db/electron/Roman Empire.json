You are Emperor and your objective is to conquer the six countries which are hostile to you at the beginning of the game. In order to conquer a country, you must wipe out their troops.<br><br>To enable you to do this, at the outset of the game you have five GENERALS, each in command of an army (signified by a flag) which does not initially contain any troops. You have also 10 LEGIONS (signified by an eagle) each consisting of 5,000 men.<br><br>The idea of the game is to build up some or all of the armies from the various legions and launch campaigns in the appropriate countries.", "platform": "Acorn Electron", "release_date": "March 1, 1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Lothlorien", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/143042"}
