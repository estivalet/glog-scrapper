He must collect the red fuel pods from the opposite side of the garage and bring them back to refill the waiting starships.<br><br>However, Jack's oxygen supply is limited to one minute per trip and some nasty Space Googjies are out to stop him.<br><br>He is equipped with a Turbopak which is strapped to his back. By activating the boosters he can negotiate the obstacle-filled garage. The edges of the platforms and also the fittings in the ceiling are 'live' and touching any of these will cause Jack to plummet to his death.<br><br>There are five levels in all, with five fuel pods to collect on each vele. The final level features Wilfred the hideous Yugg monster.<br><br>Hint: By walking off a ledge and holding down that direction key, Jack will float to the next platform down without any need to use the powerful Turbopak.", "platform": "Acorn Electron", "release_date": "February 1, 1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Micro Power", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/142973"}
