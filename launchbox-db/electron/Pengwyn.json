{"name": "Pengwyn", "overview": "The object of the game is to position the flashing blocks, which are placed randomly, in a straight line anywhere on the screen. To do this Pengwyn can move in any direction by pressing the appropriate keys. If his path is barred by ice blocks, he can melt these by pressing RETURN or move them if there is a space available.<br><br>Unfortunately however, whilst Pengwyn is attempting to manoeuvre the flashing blocks into line, the temperature is rising as the 'nasties' melt the ice, behind which they are hiding before setting off in pursuit of our hero. His only defence is to outwit them or crush them with a block of ice.<br><br>If he succeeds in his task, he will earn a few moments respite, whilst his score, based on elapsed time, is calculated, before he is faced with a fresh phase to conquer.<br><br>Remember speed is essential as the number of \"nasties\" will increase and the potential score decrease as time passes.", "platform": "Acorn Electron", "release_date": "September 1, 1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Postern", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/143055"}
