{"name": "Space Ranger", "overview": "A team of astronauts taking part in lunar exploration are stranded on the moon. Your job is to pilot the lunar module to make a successful landing on the moon, pick up the astronauts and ferry them to safety. You will have to make a number of journeys because you can only fit in one person at a time. But there are problems - the surface of the moon is riddled with craters so you can only land on certain spots; also a freak asteroid storm is making landing and taking off extremely hazardous!", "platform": "Acorn Electron", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kevin Blake", "publishers": "Audiogenic", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Udjlow1yu78", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/82036"}
