{"name": "Monkey Nuts", "overview": "Koney the Monkey is very greedy and wants to store up his house with fruit. However, he discovers, much to his dismay that it is not as easy as it seems and there are many obstacles that stand in his way.<br><br>Koney must first collect a banana, carrot, grape and a pineapple from each corner of the screen. This is done standing either side to the left or the right of the piece of fruit. Once all four pieces of fruit have been picked up, the door of the house opens and Koney can enter and place the fruit on one of the green tables.<br><br>To make things difficult there is a maze which can take one of four configurations, chosen at random and also arrows that fly around. If Koney is hit by an arrow or if the timer reaches zero, he will die. A timer counts down from 999 to zero and when Koney collects or places fruit in his house then the timer reading is added to the score and the timer is reset to 999.<br><br>When fruit has been placed on all four tables in the house (a 'Full House') then a bonus of 1,000 is added to the score and the player gains an extra life (but only if one life has already been lost).", "platform": "Acorn Electron", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Bug-Byte Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/143026"}
