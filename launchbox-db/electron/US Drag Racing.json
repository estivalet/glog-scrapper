{"name": "US Drag Racing", "overview": "The Race Marshall will walk onto the track and flag the \"All Clear\" at the beginning of each three round heat. The cars will then be pushed into position on the Grid. After a short delay the \"Start Your Engines\" message will appear. Rev your engine until the desired engine speed is reached. After a few seconds the three pit indicators at the top of the screen will turn from yellow to green.<br><br>You can now select a gear. Hold the SPACE BAR down until the gear position indication (POS) changes up (N = Neutral, S = Stall). Build up your revs again before selecting the next gear. If your revs drop too much you will stall your engine. You will see your Distance to Travel indicator (and your opponent) decrease from 0.25 miles to zero. At the end of three rounds your fastest time and your opponent's time will be displayed. If your time is faster, you will encounter the next driver and his more powerful drag car.<br><br>Your car's parachute will be automatically ejected at the end of each quarter mile run.", "platform": "Acorn Electron", "release_date": "November 1, 1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Tynesoft", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/142991"}
