{"name": "Felix and the Fruit Monsters", "overview": "The object of the game is to protect the fruit from the marauding fruit monsters until the timer (at the top of the screen) reaches zero. There are three ways to do this:<br><br>Pick up the fruit and move it out of the way of the monsters.<br>Use ether pools to put the monsters to sleep temporarily (only two pools are allowed on the screen at once).<br>Trigger the magnetic pad which teleports all the monsters back to their cave (this can only be done three times per game).<br>Each of these methods uses up different amounts of energy and this is limited (the energy level is displayed beneath the cave). Your energy is replenished by ten units if you pass over the power cells at each corner of the maze. If a monster reaches a piece of fruit it will pause momentarily to absorb its energy and then mutate. After each mutation, the monster will become more aggressive and faster. A life is lost if the player is caught by the monster or runs out of energy. An extra life is awarded at 10,000 points and the time ticks away slower as the player progresses to higher levels.", "platform": "Acorn Electron", "release_date": "July 1, 1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Micro Power", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/142957"}
