{"name": "Corn Cropper", "overview": "Corn Cropper is a simulation of a commercial wheat farm. You start with cash resources of \u00a350,000, 30 acres of rich arable land, a tractor and two farm workers and are required to build up your assets to \u00a3250,000. Decisions on when to plant, irrigate, fertilise, spray and harvest are required. Cash resources are limited and therefore strategic decisions are required as to whether to buy seed corn, land or invest in farm machinery or whether to increase labour costs by employing more workers. The graphics include a Farm map and histograms. There are five levels of difficulty.", "platform": "Acorn Electron", "release_date": "May 1, 1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Cases Computer Simulations Ltd.", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/142875"}
