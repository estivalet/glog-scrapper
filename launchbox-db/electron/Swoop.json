{"name": "Swoop", "overview": "Swoop was programmed by David Elliot for Micro Power (aka Program Power).<br><br>The objective in Swoop is to destroy the homing, swooping birdmen. There are eight phases to the game, each one being harder than the previous one. In the most difficult, you have to combat two bomb-dropping birds at once, as well as eight bombs dropped from the birdmen hovering overhead.<br>If a birdman gets past you, he lays an explosive egg on your laser-base track, thus restricting the room for manoeuver. The eggs self-destruct as you score more hits but, as the game progresses, a higher number is required before an egg disappears.<br>A bonus base is awarded each time you clear two sheets.", "platform": "Acorn Electron", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Elliot Software", "publishers": "Micro Power", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/76308"}
