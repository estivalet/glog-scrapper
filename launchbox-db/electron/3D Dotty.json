{"name": "3D Dotty", "overview": "The aim is to clear the dots on the three levels of each screen whilst avoiding the dreaded fungus. Any contact with the fungus will reduce your energy, and you lose a life when your energy reaches zero. The fungus can be blocked, but only three blocks are permitted at any one time. On completing a screen a bonus is added to your score, proportional to the amount of energy you have remaining.<br><br>There are eight different screens. After the eighth, the screens are repeated, but your energy is reduced by two units when you make contact with the fungus. You gain an extra life when your score reaches 5,000 and 10,000 points.<br><br>There is a practice mode to allow you to try any of the eight screens.", "platform": "Acorn Electron", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "J L Harris", "publishers": "Blue Ribbon Software Ltd.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/142833"}
