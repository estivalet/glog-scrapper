{"name": "Bumble Bee", "overview": "Guide Bumble around the maze swinging the red turnstiles and collecting the pollen, keeping clear of the toadstools and the fire barrels. Pursuing you around the maze is a bunch of scuttling spiders who can only be killed by luring them into the fire barrels - they are unaffected by the toadstools. The pollen flashes to let you know that a spider is about to emerge from the central lair.<br><br>When all the pollen has been collected, panels open in the box marked 'OUT'. Enter the box to progress to the next maze.", "platform": "Acorn Electron", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Micro Power", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/84696"}
