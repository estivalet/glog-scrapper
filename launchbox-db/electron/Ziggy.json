Suddenly he became half boy, half spring - like a human pogo stick - and found himself trapped in a multi-dimensional board game played on platforms that float in space and time.<br>To survive he must collect all the pyramids that he can find, avoiding the deadly Sliding Cubes, Bouncing Balls, Poison Squares and Glue Puddles. Can you help Ziggy reach the final platform, where the girl of his dreams awaits?", "platform": "Acorn Electron", "release_date": "October 1, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dean Lester", "publishers": "Audiogenic", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhwlEiwAkVM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/82046"}
