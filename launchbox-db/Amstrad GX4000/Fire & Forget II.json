Fire & Forget II is one of a number of similar games which emerged in the late 1980s and early 1990s in the wake of Sega's popular arcade driving game Out Run (1986). It is notable for the variety of its enemy sprites, and for its use of parallax scrolling. It is also notable for being one of the first video games to be launched simultaneously on two consoles.", "platform": "Amstrad GX4000", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Titus Software", "publishers": "Titus Software", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.72", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_%26_Forget_II", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/76329\n"}
