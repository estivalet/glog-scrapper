{"name": "Wonder Boy", "overview": "Wonder Boy is a sidescrolling platform game, in which the basic goal is to keep heading to to the right, avoiding obstacles, attacking enemies and jumping across platforms. Though it is not a requirement to do so, the game encourages players to keep moving to the right, as health decreases over time and the screen cannot scroll left. Health, and by extension, time, is added to by collecting fruit. There are numerous items hidden in eggs, including hammers, skateboards and fairies which can assist Tom-Tom in his quest.", "platform": "Sega SG-1000", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.61", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPNmfxSlLdQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/57723"}
