{"name": "Guzzler", "overview": "Guzzler is an arcade game developed by Tehkan. It was ported to the SG-1000 by Tsukuda Original and given Othello Multivision branding. To this day the SG-1000 version stands as the only home port of Guzzler.<br><br>You play as a character who needs to absorb water to put out fires dotted around a maze. The fires also spawn fire-based enemies which can be defeated in a similar fashion. You can only store up to three shots at one time.<br><br>Compared to other SG-1000 games, Guzzler shows some very poor production values. It thrusts you into gameplay without warning (which can result in cheap deaths) and it has a broken pause feature, which although appears to work, will unpause the game after a few seconds. There are only three maps and far fewer enemies than in the arcade version and it is also a much louder game, as the SG-1000 omits a high pitched squeak every time you make a step.", "platform": "Sega SG-1000", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tsukuda Original", "publishers": "Tsukuda Original", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.88", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv_wxy_Q-0U", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/57222"}
