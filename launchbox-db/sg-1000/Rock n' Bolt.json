{"name": "Rock n' Bolt", "overview": "Rock n' Bolt is a puzzle game originally developed by Activision, released for a number of home computers and consoles including the SG-1000 by Sega in 1985. It follows Louie the constructor who must bolt down moving platforms in their correct location within a set time limit.<br><br>The SG-1000 port is arguably a better choice over its Commodore 64, MSX and ColecoVision counterparts. This is because it is able to give the game a soundtrack without sacrificing the quality of the graphics. Unfortunately the SG-1000 version was only released in Japan.<br><br>Interestingly Rock n' Bolt's cover depicts what appears to be an earlier version of the game, sporting green pieces on a blue background (rather than blue on black) and a more western-looking Louie.", "platform": "Sega SG-1000", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.88", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Biyv4_1nfxw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/57627"}
