{"name": "Flicky", "overview": "Little baby birds, PIOPIOes, are seen basking on the bright sunny terrace. It's now time for the little PIOPIOes to take their midafternoon snack. FLICKY, your mother, is coming to take all of you back home. Let's return skipping merrily hand in hand with mama FLICKY. Oh, oh, we've got a big problem!! The ill-natured stray cat (NYANNYAN) is coming. Escape by jumping over him and throwing hammers and mugs in an effort to hit and destroy the big bad cat. FLICKY, you'll feel really relieved when you have successfully taken all of your baby PIOPIOes back home, won't you?", "platform": "Sega SG-1000", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKRWHR3dGZc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/52352"}
