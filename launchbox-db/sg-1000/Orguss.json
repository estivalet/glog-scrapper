{"name": "Orguss", "overview": "Orguss is a shoot-'em-up game developed and published by Sega for the SG-1000. In the game, the player takes control of a robot which can transform into a starship. It is based on the science fiction anime series Super Dimension Century Orguss.<br><br>The player can swap between robot and starship modes freely, though both come with their own set advantages and disadvantages. In robot mode, you are able to destroy ground targets and have greater freedom across the screen at the expense of being a bigger target for enemies. You can shoot rapidfire, but move slower. In starship mode you cannot destroy ground targets, but are less likely to be destroyed thanks to the smaller surface area of the ship. You can move faster, but cannot shoot rapidfire. 1 switches between the two forms and 2 shoots.<br><br>Orguss had a spiritual sequel in the form of TransBot, released for the Sega Master System in 1985.", "platform": "Sega SG-1000", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.38", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt-hySbkdT4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/34673"}
