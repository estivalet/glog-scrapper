It follows a yellow creature named Chack'n who must traverse across several mazes blowing up monsters.<br><br>The SG-1000 version of the game includes extra cutscenes and a training level not seen in the arcade version.<br><br>Though Chack'n Pop was not a particularly successful game for Taito, it would go on to inspire the success of Bubble Bobble, which shares many of the same characters and devotes a stage to Chack'n Pop. Chack'n has also cameoed in numerous Taito games since, including Bubble Bobble, Fairyland Story, Parasol Stars, Puzzle Bobble (and sequels), Bubble Symphony, Bubble Memories and Arkanoid DS.<br><br>Curiously this SG-1000 version uses the katakana script for writing Chack'n Pop (\u30c1\u30e3\u30c3\u30af\u30f3 \u30dd\u30c3\u30d7) as opposed to the hiragana script used in almost every other version (\u3061\u3083\u3063\u304f\u3093\u307d\u3063\u3077).", "platform": "Sega SG-1000", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TAspzPFa-Y", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/33023"}
