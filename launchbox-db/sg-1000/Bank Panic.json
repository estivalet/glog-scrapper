{"name": "Bank Panic", "overview": "Bank Panic (\u30d0\u30f3\u30af\u30d1\u30cb\u30c3\u30af) is an arcade shooting game developed by Sanritsu and manufactured by Sega in 1984. It was later ported by Sega to the SG-1000 and Sega Master System. An unlicensed clone called West Bank was released for several home computer systems. The same hardware would also be used for the later Sega/Sanritsu game Combat Hawk.<br><br>The player takes on the role of a sheriff in 19th century USA, protecting a bank from armed robbers. There are twelve doors arranged in a circle, with the player in the centre, which can be viewed three at a time. Robbers who appear from the doors are to be shot (after they draw their weapons, for a higher score) and customers are to be ignored while they make a deposit. Once deposits have been made from all twelve doors, the level is complete.", "platform": "Sega SG-1000", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sanritsu", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.82", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfOeW_3vP_w", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/33020"}
