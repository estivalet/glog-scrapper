{"name": "Yamato", "overview": "Yamato is a shooter were you sit behind the front of a ship and its guns at the bottom of the screen while the enemy ships and planes are ahead in the distance. The aim is to keep destroying the enemies ships and planes until it is game over but the more you destroy then the higher the round you play on. You take control of two cross-hairs, one for firing bullets and the other for missiles and they both move together when you move them left or right which also moves your ship.", "platform": "Sega SG-1000", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGHpR2HYnAc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/57768"}
