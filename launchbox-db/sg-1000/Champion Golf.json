{"name": "Champion Golf", "overview": "If it's raining on Sunday ... it's CHAMPION GOLF day. You can enjoy hitting the ball with the appropriate club to match the shot, walking around the course with the considerate caddie over its extensive fairways, roughs, greens, ponds and bunker areas. Getting a \"Birdie\", \"Eagle\" or an amazing \"Hole in One\", or the even more miraculous \"Albatross\" will make you feel like you are on top of the world.", "platform": "Sega SG-1000", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLA8MmQX9j0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/57214"}
