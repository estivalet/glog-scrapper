{"name": "Q*bert", "overview": "Q*bert is an arcade game by Gottlieb. It was ported to the SG-1000 by Tsukuda Original, who marketed it for their Othello Multivision console.<br><br>The objective of the game is to turn all the cubes on screen to a desired colour by moving Q*bert on top of them. Q*bert can only move in diagonals, and the player needs to be careful not to either send Q*bert off the edge or have him collide with enemies/obstacles. Occasionally cylindrical platforms appear on the edge of the screen, which when jumped on, will take Q*bert to the top.<br><br>The SG-1000 port is a very bare-bones rendition of the game and is missing many elements seen in the arcade version. It is also much harder as the port sends out more enemies in the first few levels.", "platform": "Sega SG-1000", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tsukuda Original", "publishers": "Tsukuda Original", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.61", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwaMv0j8-Go", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/57626"}
