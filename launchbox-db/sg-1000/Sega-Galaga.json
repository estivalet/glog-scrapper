{"name": "Sega-Galaga", "overview": "Sega-Galaga is the SG-1000 port of Galaga, and is strangely the only port to receive a name change.<br><br>The player pilots a starship and must destroy all the on-screen enemies, similar to Space Invaders and Galaxian. However, the enemies in Galaga have the power to steal your ship to use as reinforcements (meaning the player loses a life). However, if you are able to destroy the enemy who has captured your ship, you are able to pilot both ships at once, doubling your firepower at the expense of being a bigger target.<br><br>Though Sega-Galaga is essentially the same game as the arcade original, the limitations of the SG-1000 means the graphics and sound are not quite as advanced. Also the \"challenging stages\" have been omitted, meaning each stage is identical to the last.", "platform": "Sega SG-1000", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AtQD-hv-Dc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/34676"}
