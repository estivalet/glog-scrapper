{"altername_name": [], "name": "Everest", "overview": "Everest is a mountain climbing game in which the player must try to climb Mount Everest. The mountain is shown from the side and filled with numbers. Each number corresponds with the amount of strength it costs to climb to that spot. The player can move in eight directions with the numeric pad. Judging from the numbers the player must find the less intensive route to the top. Additional dangers include blizzards that roam the mountainsides and avalanches. The player can also fall a certain distance from time to time. Getting caught in a blizzard, like moving itself costs energy. When all energy is depleted the game is over. The player is rated by how far he or she climbed. The game keeps an average rating of all previous attempts.
