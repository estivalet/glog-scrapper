{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tut-Tut", "overview": "Game Description: It is coming to the end of 1921's digging season in Egypt. Your excavations have not gone so well this year, failing to find any trace of the legendary and as yet undiscovered Pharaoh's tomb. Then in your final weeks, wild stories recounting the wrath of vengeful mummies strangling would-be tomb local raiders filter back to base camp. At last some concrete leads worth looking into, and opportunities too good to pass up. Occultist tales of curses be dammed, you're an Egyptologist and grand adventurer, such nonsense can't possibly hurt you. Or can it? Playing the Game Tut-Tut is one part puzzle, two parts arcade action. The game is comprised of 28 levels, plus a hidden treasure chamber which may only be opened if you are deemed worthy. Collect gems, amulets and bracelets for points, you'll need 5000 before the end of \"Sutekh's Eye\" (level 28) for the treasure chamber to open. Amulets and Bracelets will freeze the player or halt mummies respectively. To complete each level the player will need to collect keys, open doors, move blocks before finding exits to lower crypt levels. Keep an eye out for the Pharaoh's roaming guardians, they're not the smartest of the undead but they are relentless. Available for free (or pay your own price) via itch.io, but also available physically through TDW8B.com.
