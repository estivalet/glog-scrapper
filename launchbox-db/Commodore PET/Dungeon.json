{"altername_name": ["Dungeon 15"], "name": "Dungeon", "overview": "Dungeon is a Roguelike game. Like other games in this genre the player explores a dungeon in a top-down view and must collect loot and kill enemies to progress. Each dungeon is generated randomly and only becomes visible during exploration. The player can only see one tile far. When encountering a monster the game automatically determines whether the player wins the fight or not, and (if the player survives) how much hitpoints he or she loses.
