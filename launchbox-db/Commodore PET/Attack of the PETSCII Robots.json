{"altername_name": [], "name": "Attack of the PETSCII Robots", "overview": "Attack of the Petscii Robots is a top-down action/puzzle game. It is inspired by oblique top-down projection games like Ultima, but takes much of the gameplay concepts from first-person shooters. The object is to destroy all of the robots. To do this, you have to search objects in the game for weapons and other items to help you along the way. Many scenarios require complex thinking and problem solving, rather than just action shooting.", "platform": "Commodore PET", "release_date": "February 13, 2021", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "David Murray", "publishers": "8-Bit Productions", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/150049-attack-of-the-petscii-robots\n"}
