{"altername_name": [], "name": "Santa Paravia and Fiumaccio", "overview": "The game consists of yearly turns, beginning in 1400; each turn involves the allocation of grain, counted in steres, and funds, counted in florins, attempting to grow the colony in both population and size. A ruler must ensure that sufficient grain supplies are available to feed his people; by distributing excess grain, a ruler can encourage more citizens to move into his city-state. However, often famine and rats cause grain reserves to diminish. Funds can be spent to purchase more land, military forces, or various types of structures. These structures include revenue producing mills and markets as well as prestigious palaces and cathedrals. The different social classes present in this game are serfs, clergy, merchants and nobility. Based loosely on the text game Hamurabi, Santa Paravia and Fiumaccio was an early God game. It combined 'guns and butter' economic tradeoffs with graphic development of a kingdom with buildings being constructed and shown on the screen as well as character development, shown as progressive promotions from baron to king.", "platform": "Commodore PET", "release_date": "1978", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Folklife Terminal Club", "publishers": "Folklife Terminal Club", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "6", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/155357-santa-paravia-and-fiumaccio\n"}
