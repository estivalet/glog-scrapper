{"altername_name": [], "name": "Thunt!", "overview": "Thunt! is a maze game in which the player is tasked with finding treasure in a randomly generated maze. Enemies also roam the maze and will kill you when they come in contact. They do not know where the player is unless they have line of sight. The player is given the general coordinate of the treasure, but must still look around in that vicinity. When the player finds the treasure more points can be scored by solving an anagram puzzle. Finally the player must find the exit, which is again at a random location of which only a general coordinate is known. When the player escapes the game is over and his or her score is shown.", "platform": "Commodore PET", "release_date": "September 1, 1980", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Chris Torkildson", "publishers": "The Code Works", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtube.com/watch?v=N5iqcxm4JTg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/158097-thunt\n"}
