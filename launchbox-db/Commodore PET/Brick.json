{"altername_name": [], "name": "Brick", "overview": "Brick is a one-button game in which the player must prevent a brick from breaking a window. The brick is thrown at the window with a variable speed. Halfway its flight the brick will turn invisible. The player can stop the brick in mid-air and any given time by pressing the Y button. The closer the brick is to the window (without breaking it) the more points the player scores. Breaking the window costs the player many points. The average of all throws counts.
