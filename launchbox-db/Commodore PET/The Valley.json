{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Valley", "overview": "The Valley is a graphical roguelike RPG with a simple interface and semi-real-time combat system. The background story is all but non-existent, suffice to say that you're the hero and you want to explore the name-providing Valley to slay monsters and find treasure. The game is played in a turn-based manner, except fighting, which is timed delay. You only have half a second or so to enter your next move. You can attack the monster's head, body or legs, or you can cast one of three magic spells. Of course, some monsters can do the same to you. Finally, you may sometimes surprise a monster, getting a free attack or the choice to retreat (which is not possible in a normal fight).", "platform": "Commodore PET", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "ASP Software", "publishers": "ASP Software", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/155315-the-valley\n"}
