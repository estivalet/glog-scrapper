Wander the hills in search of gold and glory but be very, very careful where you tread! There are things here that will make your wildest nightmares look like a children's book. Fancy meeting a Mind Flayer, for example? Or how about shaking hands with an Asmodeus? You'll only do that once! Treasure is here to be found though...the hard way. See just how good you are at adventuring with this practically unsurvivable fantasy.
