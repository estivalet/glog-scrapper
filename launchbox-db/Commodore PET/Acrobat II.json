In the game the player must position a see-saw in order to keep an acrobat in the air. The player scores points by popping balloons that are placed near the ceiling of the circus. In addition the player scores points for each jump and can score various bonus points. If the acrobat touches the floor the game is over and he's carried off in an ambulance.", "platform": "Commodore PET", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Commodore Japan Limited", "publishers": "Commodore Japan Limited", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beBB-RBukbs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148081-acrobat-ii\n"}
