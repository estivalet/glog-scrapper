{"altername_name": ["Nachtmerrie Park"], "name": "Nightmare Park", "overview": "In Nightmare Park the player must try to escape the park. There are several paths for the player to walk, but each is subject to various random events. The player starts with three lives and can lose lives in the random events or when accidentally departing from the path. Random events usually involve twitch game play, such as dodging stampeding unicorns, moving towards the on-screen exit before a time limit is reached, solving a sum within a time limit, or memorizing a word that's only shown a fraction of a second on the screen. When the player loses a life he or she can continue on the spot where the life was lost, but when all lives are lost the player has to start over.", "platform": "Commodore PET", "release_date": "1980", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bob Chappell", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/369803-nightmare-park\n"}
