{"altername_name": [], "name": "Air Attack", "overview": "Air Attack is a one-key action game; the player has to drop bombs to clear all blocks so it can land safely at the bottom of the screen. The game is very simple and was the first game to implement this type of gameplay. A plane moves from left to right across the screen, slightly descending every time it wraps back to the left side. The player has to press the spacebar to drop bombs to bombard the mountains below so the plane won't crash into them. You can only drop one bomb at a time, so they have to be dropped carefully as to clear the tallest bricks first. The level is completed when all blocks are removed and the plane has landed safely at the bottom of the screen.", "platform": "Commodore PET", "release_date": "1979", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Peter Calver", "publishers": "Supersoft", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.62", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixv3EHOh4Y4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148083-air-attack\n"}
