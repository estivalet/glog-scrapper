{"altername_name": [], "name": "Arrow", "overview": "Arrow is a Snake variant. The player controls a snake with a variable length and has sixty seconds in which to score points. Points come in numbered blocks that appear and disappear from the playing field from time to time. The number corresponds both with the addition to the score and the additional length of the player's snake. If the player runs into himself or a wall the game ends prematurely. The game does not keep track of high scores. The game was developed by the late, great Jim Butterfield and released by the Pet User Group in November 1978.", "platform": "Commodore PET", "release_date": "November 1, 1978", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jim Butterfield", "publishers": "PET User Group", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/166463-arrow\n"}
