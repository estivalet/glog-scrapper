{"altername_name": ["Space"], "name": "Space!", "overview": "Space! is an arcade first person shooter. The player sits inside a spacecraft and can rotate the view in any direction. The aim is to shoot as many enemy spacecraft as possible. Each shot costs energy. When the energy level gets to low the game ends. In addition to firing the laser, the ship also drains energy automatically, creating a time limit within which the player can operate. Enemies don't fire back.", "platform": "Commodore PET", "release_date": "March 1, 1979", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Greg Erker", "publishers": "The Code Works", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.62", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6vOBTF1e1E", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/117602-space\n"}
