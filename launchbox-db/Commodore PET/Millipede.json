{"altername_name": [], "name": "Millipede", "overview": "This conversion of the arcade classic tries to be as true to the original as possible. The player can move in four directions but is limited in how far he or she can move upwards. Centipedes will crawl down which can be shot. Hitting them in the middle will cause them to split up. Millipedes move in a horizontal motion, but will change direction and move down one step when they come in contact with an obstacle. The player can remove obstacles and when hitting a part of the millipedes it becomes an obstacle as well. Aside from Millipedes other bugs also enter the screen, each with their own movement behaviors.", "platform": "Commodore PET", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "On Line Software", "publishers": "On Line Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/369799-millipede\n"}
