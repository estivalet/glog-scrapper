When you get to the level where you want to work, press and start digging with your pick. Gold (or hazards, such as springs or hard rock) will occur at the dots. When you find gold, get in the elevator and deposit it in the bank! You have a drill [D], explosives [E], and a pump [P] at your disposal. However, using these tools costs money!
