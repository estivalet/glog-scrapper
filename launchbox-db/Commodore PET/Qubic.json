{"altername_name": ["3D Tic-Tac-Toe"], "name": "Qubic", "overview": "3-D Tic-Tac-Toe is based on the 1953 Parker Brothers board game Qubic. The game is identical to Connect Four except that it features a third dimension. This means that the player can try to get four in a row in nine different directions instead of four. The board is 4x4x4 and player and computer take turn placing tokens. In the game each location has a numeric coordinate which the player must type in. There is no multiplayer possible. This version features a different graphical implementation than the other BASIC versions that can be found in this database.", "platform": "Commodore PET", "release_date": "1978", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "David H.
