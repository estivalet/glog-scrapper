{"altername_name": ["Titrate"], "name": "Titrator", "overview": "Titrator is a simulation game in which you perform titration. The object is to find out how strong the given caustic solution is. This is done by titrating with HCl. When the solution gets a neutral acidity the indicator will change color. The player can add HCl in a continuous flow or drop by drop. The game automatically does the math. You can fail by adding too much HCl.", "platform": "Commodore PET", "release_date": "May 1, 1979", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Garry Flynn", "publishers": "The Code Works", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/168333-titrator\n"}
