{"altername_name": [], "name": "Boobs", "overview": "You need to help Boobs! Boobs is an alien on the planet Kerflunkydunk. Now, on Earth, Boobs might be a funny name, but on Kerflunkydunk, lots of aliens are named Boobs. It's like Earth's equivalent of \"George.\" But NASA heard that there might be boobs in space, so all the astronauts are eager to see boobs (all the men astronauts, that is), not realizing they're not women's boobs, but our little alien friend named Boobs. Your job as Boobs is to shoot down enemy rockets coming down the Van Doozy Corridor, the tunnel near Kerflunkydunk (enemy being Earth.) But beware of the falling stars and other aliens! How many rockets can Boobs shoot down?", "platform": "Magnavox Odyssey 2", "release_date": "July 28, 2014", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "", "developers": "Chris Read", "publishers": "Chris Read", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/374091-boobs\n"}
