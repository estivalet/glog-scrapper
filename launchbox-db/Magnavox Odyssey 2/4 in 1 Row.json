Two players (Pussycat and Hounddog) take turns dropping colored (red or green) discs in an eight-column six-row grid. The object is to place 4 discs in a row, either vertically, horizontally or diagonally. An strategic indicator number on the right side of the screen, besides each name, will show the chances of each player to get four discs in a row. The higher the number, the higher the chances. If the number reads 125 it means the player is just one move away from winning. The strategic indicator can be turned off by pressing CLEAR. When playing against the computer, two variations with three skill levels are available: 1. Playing against Microcat I, II or III (selected by pressing 1, 2 or 3). Microcat uses a micro-sensor (represented by a \u03bc sign) which will stop over each column calculating its chances. The disc will be dropped where the \u03bc stops. The higher the skill level, the bigger the sensor and calculation times.", "platform": "Magnavox Odyssey 2", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "N.V.
