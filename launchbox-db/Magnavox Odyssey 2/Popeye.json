Right now, she's got you running in circles, chasing hearts and notes all over the place. Then, there's that blubber-brain, Brutus, who's out to get you. While you're dashing around, he's taking shots to knock you overboard. And if that's not bad enough - you've got that nasty 'ol biddy, the Sea Hag, pelting you with bottles. Now you'd think with all this going on, you could rely on your spinach. NO CHANCE! It's there one second - gone the next! So go ahead, put yourself in Popeye's place - if you think you can handle all the action!", "platform": "Magnavox Odyssey 2", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Magnavox", "publishers": "Parker Brothers", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.9", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/129516-popeye\n"}
