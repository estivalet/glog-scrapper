{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mr. Roboto!", "overview": "Prototype It\u00b4s the year 8048 and mankind has been anhialated. The computers and machines that were built to help man have become smart enough to rule over \u2013 and eventually destroy \u2013 all civilization. Now, the once united machines have fractured, and the machines have begun to battle with each other. Two factions remain. Each side has a CPU master and 6 robot warrior servants. The CPUs can\u00b4t move, so the robots are sent out to do the dirty work. The goal: shutdown the opposing side\u00b4s CPU. Many obstacles are in place to prevent this: the other robots, energy surges, firewalls, viruses, and the CPU\u00b4s own laser defenses.", "platform": "Magnavox Odyssey 2", "release_date": "", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/22245-mr-roboto\n"}
