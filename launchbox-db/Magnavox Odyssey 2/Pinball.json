{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pinball", "overview": "Pinball!, as the name implies, is a pinball game for one or two players. There are two game \"formats\". The main format has a table with 7 bumpers and two sockets, with two flippers at the bottom center. Holes at the bottom sides of the table are opened when the bumpers in the second line from bottom to top are hit. At first, hitting the bumpers adds 75 points to the score, but as the bumpers change colors when hit, the amount of points scored increase. The bumpers start red, then change to green, orange, dark blue, pink, light blue, white, black and then red again. The table can also be nudged by moving the joystick in the desired nudge direction. Each player has 5 balls to play. The second game mode allows players to design their own table by placing the 7 bumpers in any desired position. After placing all bumper, the game starts as usual.", "platform": "Magnavox Odyssey 2", "release_date": "July 29, 2000", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "", "developers": "Don McGuiness", "publishers": "CGE Services", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.79", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/22251-pinball\n"}
