{"altername_name": [], "name": "AMOK!", "overview": "AMOK! was the first Odyssey\u00b2 new release about 15 years after the console was discontinued. It is inspired by the Stern arcade classic, Berzerk. The player is trapped in a spaceship and is armed with a laser pistol, which can fire in all 8 directions. Each stage is a maze with one or more exits, and the player has to try to exit them while avoiding to touch its walls and get killed. Besides the danger of the walls, the player will face the berzerk robot sentinels, which can move about and shoot, but that can also be killed if they touch the walls. After a while, the Smileybot will appear and try to kill the player. The Smileybot can pass through walls and cannot be killed by the player. The game features 12 stages of increasing difficulty. The player has 3 lives; dying will make the player restart the current level, with all berzerk robot sentinels being replaced. The game was developed by John Donzila who is well-known in the Vectrex homebrew community.", "platform": "Magnavox Odyssey 2", "release_date": "1998", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "John Dondzila", "publishers": "John Dondzila", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efOXTzSe4os", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/22163-amok\n"}
