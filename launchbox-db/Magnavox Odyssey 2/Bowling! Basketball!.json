{"altername_name": ["Bowling + Basketball"], "name": "Bowling!/Basketball!", "overview": "BOWLING! A true electronics simulation! You go straight for the pins or hook from either side of the alley! But once you commit to the hook you're on the hook! There's no going back. Digital scoring! Sync-sound action! Two to four players. (Lanes change color to let you know when it's your turn.) BASKETBALL! For ultimate realism, there's even a built-in electronic gravity field! The electronic basketball bounces like a real basketball. If you don't get a clear shot into the basket, the ball hits the rim or the backboard and bounces back into the court! On-screen digital scoring and timer. Sync-sound action!
