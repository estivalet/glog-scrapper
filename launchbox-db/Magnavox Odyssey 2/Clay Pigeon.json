{"altername_name": [], "name": "Clay Pigeon", "overview": "As the name implies, Clay Pigeon! is a clay pigeon shooting game. At the left corner, a trap launches targets toward the shooter. The player controls the shooter which stands in the right corner of the screen. In order to proceed to the next level, the player has to hit at least eight of the ten plates thrown. While he's shooting, some ducks will appear flying over his head. They'll drop \"bombs\" over him, and if he doesn't avoid them, he'll be stunned for some time. If he fails to shoot the minimum plates necessary, an eagle will appear and attack him. He needs to shoot the eagle twice to avoid its attack. If he fails, the game is over. The shooter has two shots per row; after those two shots, he has to reload the gun, by putting it down. He can be moved left and right, but if he exceeds the left mark, he'll fall to the ground, being subject to lose plates. The player earns five points per each plate, ten points per each duck and 100 points per eagle (50 per shot).", "platform": "Magnavox Odyssey 2", "release_date": "January 1, 1982", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Philips", "publishers": "Philips", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.71", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4LtnZ1sdJ8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/22177-clay-pigeon\n"}
