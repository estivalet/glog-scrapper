{"altername_name": [], "name": "Kilopede", "overview": "Kilopede is a variant of the arcade game Centipede. It's a fixed screen shoot 'em up where the player is in control of a beetle that has to kill centipede-like creatures as they move down the screen, row by row, towards the beetle's position. When shooting at the centipede it splits in two parts, both which keep moving down the screen. On the screen there are numerous mushrooms which decide its movement and give it some protection from the beetle's fire. Additionally some other unfriendly creatures will appear such as caterpillars, fleas and spiders. If the centipede manages to reach the bottom a large foot will appear and stomp the beetle to death.", "platform": "Exidy Sorcerer", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Matthew B.
