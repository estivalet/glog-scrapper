{"altername_name": [], "name": "Astro Attacker", "overview": "Astro Attacker is a fixed screen shoot 'em up that is similar to the arcade game Astro Blaster. The player moves a space ship along the bottom of the screen while firing at the enemies that move around the screen. The space ship has a limited amount of fuel and it might run out if the player moves too recklessly. It is also possible to overheat the lazer cannon if it's used too frequently. Each level of the game contains five waves of enemies, each with its own kind that has its own movement pattern. There are spinners, lazer ships, rockets, flame throwers and meteor showers. Like in Astro Blaster, each level ends with the player having to dock with a mothership which restores fuel and shield strength and cools the lazer cannon. Before a game the player can choose the number of shields (lives) from one to nine.", "platform": "Exidy Sorcerer", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "David J.
