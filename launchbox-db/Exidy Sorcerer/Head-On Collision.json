{"altername_name": [], "name": "Head-On Collision", "overview": "Head-On Collision is a variant of the Sega/Gremlin arcade game Head-On. The player controls a black car travelling clockwise around a race track made up of five lanes. The track is full of dots and diamonds that give points when collected. Meanwhile an enemy car is driving in the opposite direction and is attempting to crash into the player's car. To avoid losing lives the player has to avoid the enemy by switching lanes which can only be done at four intersections. The player has five cars and when they are all gone the game is over.", "platform": "Exidy Sorcerer", "release_date": "1980", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Lee Anders", "publishers": "Quality Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/154334-head-on-collision\n"}
