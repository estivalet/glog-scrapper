{"altername_name": [], "name": "Arrows and Alleys", "overview": "Arrows and Alleys for the Exidy Sorcerer is a variant of the arcade game Targ where the player takes control of a car that moves through a network of alleys that are viewed from a top down perspective. In the alleys are also a number of arrows that start at the opposite end of the screen and attempts to crash into the player's car. The player's task is to prevent them from doing this by shooting them down first. At some times a pit will open up and a rocket will appear. It has to be avoided just like the arrows but is worth more points when shot. The player has five cars and an extra one is given for every level completed. There are four difficulty levels and the game can be played by one or two players in hot seat. The game was developed by Vic Tolomei and published in 1980 by Quality Software.", "platform": "Exidy Sorcerer", "release_date": "1980", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Vic Tolomei", "publishers": "Quality Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/154321-arrows-and-alleys\n"}
