{"name": "Alex Kidd in Miracle World 2", "overview": "What is this, there was another Miracle World game?! No, actually this is fan-made. But it would be easy to think it's from Sega, as it has great level design, nice graphics, and an original soundtrack. The plot takes place just months after the first game and completely ignores the disappointing official sequel, Alex Kidd in the Enchanted Castle.<br><br>Game story<br>It's been 6 months since Alex defeated Janken the Great and reclaimed 'The Crown'. Alex's brother Egle has taken the throne and oversees the city of Radaxian. There is still unrest on the planet Aries however, as monsters continue to roam the land. Alex is still greatly concerned by the whereabouts of his missing father. Radaxian's forces have been unable to locate King Thunder, so Alex sets off himself to find him. He retraces his steps and returns to the place where the trail was lost. Perhaps there was something he missed?<br>Alex must further explore the Miracle World, traverse dangerous lands and use the art of Shellcore to defeat his enemies. He once again has his motorcycle and peticopter to help him get around but now he also has a plane to fly him across treacherous waters.<br>Experience even more action in Alex's greatest adventure yet. Once again, it takes a Kidd like you to handle this even greater challenge.", "platform": "Sega Master System", "release_date": "2017", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ian Wall", "publishers": "Sega8bit", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.31", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyqA8FSjDVQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86577"}
