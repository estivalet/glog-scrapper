{"name": "Dr. Hello", "overview": "Unlicensed Dr. Mario clone developed for the MSX and ported to the Sega Master System. It was developed in South Korea by a company known as \"Sis Co.\" in 1991, without the backing from either Sega or Nintendo. The game uses a completely different set of graphics and music to Dr. Mario, but the gameplay is exactly the same. Despite being released on a Master System cartridge, the Master System version runs in SG-1000 mode, and hence appears to have weaker graphics than most other Master System games. This is likely because the MSX and SG-1000 share similar specifications, and porting from one system to another was not too difficult", "platform": "Sega Master System", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sis Co.", "publishers": "Sis Co.", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Cy51EAUys", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/84748"}
