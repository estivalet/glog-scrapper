This game was another attempt of Tec Toy to suit the brazilian children audience, using characters from popular comics, series and magazines and, even though people generally don't have the game in their top lists, everyone in Brazil who lived in the 90's remembers of it with much affection. This version gives the player five lives to start with, while the original game gives only three.", "platform": "Sega Master System", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tec Toy", "publishers": "TecToy", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGknSCxSkMg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72368"}
