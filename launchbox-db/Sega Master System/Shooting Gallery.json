{"name": "Shooting Gallery", "overview": "If you think this is just another shoot 'em up game, think again. Nothing demands more skill, more daring, more intense gameplay than SHOOTING GALLERY! And hopefully, you've got what it takes to survive. A keen eye. A steady hand. And the invincible Sega Light Phaser that actually records misses. If you aim straight and aim on target, just maybe you'll be able to shoot everything from iron-clad Spaceships to incredibly fast Blimps. But don't despair if the going gets tough. Because it gets tough for everyone.", "platform": "Sega Master System", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.14", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2852"}
