{"name": "Missile Defense 3-D", "overview": "War has been declared between two super powers. At play are real nuclear missiles and the outcome looks dim. If their missiles make contact, there's no chance for survival. Luckily there's hope. You and The Eliminator, the only anti-nuclear laser in operation. Aboard a fugitive space station, you're armed for intervention and your mission is clear: stop all nuclear missiles. But it won't be easy. Because those missiles are being launched at you, too. So play for keeps. This is the most important challenge you may ever face.", "platform": "Sega Master System", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.92", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2765"}
