It is a \"port\" of Xevious, a 1982 arcade shoot-'em-up game by Namco. It was also brought to the MSX by the same company.<br><br>The Micro Xevious runs in the SG-1000 graphics mode, and is a loose conversion of the original. There are more enemies on screen, the level layout is different and less of the screen is visible due to the Master System's smaller screen resolution. Pressing 1 at the title screen will cause the game to play custom-made background music, while pressing 2 will use the music found in the arcade game.<br><br>There have been changes in the way the Solvalou drops bombs, making aiming harder than it needs to be. Attempting to pause the game will reset it.", "platform": "Sega Master System", "release_date": "January 14, 1990", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Zemina", "publishers": "Zemina", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/101707"}
