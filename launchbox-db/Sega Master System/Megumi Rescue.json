{"name": "Megumi Rescue", "overview": "Megumi Rescue lets you control a rescue party of three to save people from a burning building. The group consists of two people holding a jumping sheet, and a third fire fighter bouncing on the sheet to reach the building's inhabitants at the windows.<br><br>The sheet can be moved left and right, and the jumper can enter a square with an open/smashed window for a few seconds. If there is a fire behind the window, it will be put out. If the room is empty, it will be searched, and to certain chance, an item will be dropped. If there are inhabitants in the room, the jumper will take one person with him, which will be rescued on reaching the sheet.", "platform": "Sega Master System", "release_date": "July 30, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2750"}
