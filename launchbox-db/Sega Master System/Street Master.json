{"name": "Street Master", "overview": "Street Master is an unlicensed port of Street Fighter I. It also sports a few challengers from Street Fighter II. The five enemies are Joe, Chun Li, \"Ninja\" (for some reason they dropped Geki's name), Bison (the boxer, in his SFII-attire) and Gen. The player always takes the role of Ken, Ryu isn't available (although the sprite is actually colored like him). In 2-player mode the second player, who fights on the left side in this game, gets to chose between the 5 enemies. Player one is denied that privilege, though.", "platform": "Sega Master System", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Zemina", "publishers": "Zemina", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/26994"}
