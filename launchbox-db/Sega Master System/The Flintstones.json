{"name": "The Flintstones", "overview": "YABBA DABBA DOO! It's the weekend and Fred Flintstone returns home from work very excited about the Bedrock Super Bowl final tonight. As he arrives home Wilma reminds him of his promise to paint the living room before her mother arrives on Sunday. Wilma insists that Fred can only go bowling if he paints the living room.

Chaos, fun and the Flintstones humor is everywhere!", "platform": "Sega Master System", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tiertex", "publishers": "Grandslam Video", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2902"}
