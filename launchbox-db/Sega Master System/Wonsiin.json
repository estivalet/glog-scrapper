{"name": "Wonsiin", "overview": "A port of the Famicom game Shin Jinrui: The New Type (Adventures of Dino Riki in the US), which apparently gave Zemina opportunity to exploit their vertical shmup code even once more. Typically, the scrolling is choppy here, too. There have been several other small compromises, but overall Wonsiin is a decent port of the Knightmare inspired game. Especially some elements that one would think would have been sacrificed on the MSX, most impressively the attacking dinosaur skeletons, are intact. Still, Wonsiin ends after three stages, leaving out the final challenges.", "platform": "Sega Master System", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Zemina", "publishers": "Zemina", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REN49ztwcEc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/84741"}
