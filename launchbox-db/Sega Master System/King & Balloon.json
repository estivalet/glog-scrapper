{"name": "King & Balloon", "overview": "A vertical shoot-'em-up game extremely similar in nature to Namco's Galaxian (1979) and Galaga (1981). Players control a turret and have to destroy enemy \"balloons\" before they can kidnap the king at the bottom of the screen and fly him away from the action. The player can be killed without reprocussions - the life system is based on how many times the king is kidnapped.", "platform": "Sega Master System", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/84986"}
