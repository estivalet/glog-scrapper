{"name": "Paperboy", "overview": "Get ready for the ride of your life as the new PAPERBOY for the neighborhood. What a neighborhood! Watch out for runaway lawnmowers, a boom box or two, a guy on a unicycle and, of course, break dancers.<br><br>Every day you make your rounds, delivering papers to your subscribers. Throw the paper at the wrong time, and you might break a window. Throw it at just the right time, it lands in the mail box and you get extra points. At the end of the day you gain or lose subscribers, depending on your performance.<br><br>Crash too often and you will be forced into an early retirement. The more experience you get, the tougher the obstacles. Watch out for that construction worker! Pedal faster to get away from that dog! Look out for that car! Oh well...just another day in the neighborhood.", "platform": "Sega Master System", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tiertex", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.05", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2802"}
