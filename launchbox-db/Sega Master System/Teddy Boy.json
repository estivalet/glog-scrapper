{"name": "Teddy Boy", "overview": "Teddy Boy stars a young boy who is armed with a gun. Each level is an infinitely repeating maze with several dice. Each die is filled with monsters which hatch out and the player must shoot to shrink, then collect them. If the player does not collect each shrunken monster quickly, it turns into a time-eating bug which flies to the time limit bar and consumes a chunk of it. If you touch one monster or run out of time then you lose a life. The game ends if all lives are lost.", "platform": "Sega Master System", "release_date": "October 20, 1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.77", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eltAl9QQR_4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2894"}
