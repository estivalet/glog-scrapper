{"name": "Gekioko PunPun Maru", "overview": "From the creator of Fix-It Felix Jr for the Sega Mega Drive and the bizarre adaptation of Pringles in video game form comes an all new homebrew hit for the Sega Master System. This frantic arcade style platformer known as Geki Oko PunPun Maru is based upon the imaginary NES game of the same named meme, offering a vibrant visual style and addictive gameplay to boot.<br><br>If anything, Geki Oko PunPun Maru features very similar action to that of the original arcade title Mario Bros. Instead of spiny shells spawning and heading down to attack, ninjas come flying from above and it's up to you to tackle them with your vertical shooting huffs and puffs over 12 stages. This strange projectile is a play on the game's title which according to the origin of the meme roughly translates to 'being angry, in a cute way'.", "platform": "Sega Master System", "release_date": "December 15, 2013", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Future Driver", "publishers": "Future Driver", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83355"}
