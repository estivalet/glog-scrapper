{"name": "Woody Pop: Shinjinrui no Block Kuzushi", "overview": "With a wooden paddle, which in fact is Woody the tree spirit, you bounce your ball against bricks laid out in a big house filled with toys. The toys will come out to disturb you. When you hit \"mystery bricks\", wind-up toy soldiers or robots come out, obstructing your ball. On some levels, a toy train will cross your path as well. Speaking of wells, the bottom of the screen is not a big black hole as in most other games of this kind \u2013 instead the whole covers only a part of the wall, so that even if you miss the ball, it might bounce back in the corners.<br><br>Once a room is cleared, you can choose freely between up to three adjacent rooms to progress to, making this game less linear than usual.", "platform": "Sega Master System", "release_date": "March 15, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.38", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2951"}
