{"name": "Nemesis", "overview": "Nemesis for the Sega Master System is an MSX port, which was converted without a license and released in South Korea by Zemina in 1987. This version of the game is identical to the MSX version, running in the graphics mode intended for SG-1000 backwards compatibility. As a result the gameplay is significantly more choppy than its arcade counterpart, and the graphics do not take advantage of the Master System hardware.", "platform": "Sega Master System", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Zemina", "publishers": "Zemina", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIs3Hg7Bzes", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/84995"}
