{"name": "Comical Machine Gun Joe", "overview": "Comical Machine Gun Joe is a simple arcade type shoot'em up. You control a gunslinger called Joe on a single static screen and need to shoot baddies until a boss appears. Once the boss is shot, the game will switch to another screen.<br><br>Apart from shooting, Joe can also jump very high, which is often need to reach enemies in higher places. Once in a while a spider will appear, which reflects both your and your foes' shots for some reason. There also pigs appearing frequently, which give away items like a smart bomb when shot. Another odd feature is that hit enemies will shrink and walk off to the lower end of the screen. If they come in contact with Joe, they will cling on to him. This slows him down and constrains his ability to jump, but the enemies will also serve as a bullet shield.<br><br>Like many early arcade games, the game has no ending. After several screens, the game starts over at the first location.", "platform": "Sega Master System", "release_date": "April 21, 1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.23", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN1qIoVorI0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/26706"}
