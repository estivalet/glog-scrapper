{"name": "Knightmare II: The Maze of Galious", "overview": "Unlicensed port.<br><br>Sequel to Konami's MSX game Knightmare. Knightmare II: The Maze of Galious is a side-view, flick-screen platform game. The player controls Popolon and Aphrodite, entering the evil priest Galious' castle to free their yet-to-be-born son Pampas from the priest's evil clutches. Being able to control Popolon and Aphrodite means the player can switch between two characters that have slightly different abilities. For example, Popolon can push stones and open heavy doors. On the other hand, Aphrodite survives longer under water and she can shoot more projectiles. Should either character die, the other can visit a shrine and pay for resurrection. Unlike typical platform games, both characters can survive some damage as they have hit point bars.", "platform": "Sega Master System", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Zemina", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/84988"}
