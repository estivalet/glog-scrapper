{"name": "Sapo Xul\u00e9: SOS Lagoa Polu\u00edda", "overview": "Three scientists built a underwater trash processing complex in order to produce cheap energy, at the expense of the ecosystem. The lagoon animals became desperate and sought the wise C\u00e1gado Ad\u00e3o for help. He quickly found the solution: to build a heavily armored submarine, to destroy the facilities and send the invaders back home. Sapo Xul\u00e9 was asked to perform this mission and destroy the powerful scientists' submarine ships.<br><br>Sapo Xul\u00e9: S.O.S. Lagoa Polu\u00edda (which means Sapo Xul\u00e9: S.O.S. Polluted Lagoon) is a modified version of Astro Warrior, with its space ship replaced by a submarine ship driven by Sapo Xul\u00e9, a character based on a popular toy in Brazil back in the 80's: a toad with shoes which, when taken off, release a really bad smell.<br><br>This game is a basic shoot-em-up, but instead of destroying space ships and aliens, the player must destroy the scientists' facilities and clean up the lagoon, by destroying the trash in it \u2013 the lagoon is filled with matches, eaten apples, cotton swabs, boots and other kinds of junk.", "platform": "Sega Master System", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tec Toy", "publishers": "Tec Toy", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.12", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9C5lksvJbI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/29508"}
