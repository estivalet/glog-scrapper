{"name": "Vigilante", "overview": "Play this arcade smash hit on your Sega System! On the baddest streets of the city they know your name. You are lean and mean...the karate master they call the Vigilante! Your turf was left alone. Your friends and neighbors lived in peace. Until the Rogue gang got too big for their britches. You chilled, hoping things wouldn't get too rough. No such luck.<br><br>They've taken your girlfriend Maria, and there's only one thing you can do...get her back...anyway you can! You have fists of steel! Legs like pistons! And courage that just won't quit! You will need all three because the Rogues are waiting with knives, guns and a whole hunch of nasty punks!<br><br>And you'll have to fight fast. If the Rogues make it back to their headquarters before you rescue Maria all hope will be lost. But catch them first and you'll fight the leader of the Rogues. Win Maria...and your turf...will remain safe.<br><br>Feel any pressure? No way. You're the Vigilante!", "platform": "Sega Master System", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.39", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_581pcIq3D0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2935"}
