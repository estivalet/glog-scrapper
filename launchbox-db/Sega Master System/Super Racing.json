{"name": "Super Racing", "overview": "Super Racing is a Formula 1 racing game. There are two main game modes: Real mode (with the engine sounds only) and BMG mode (with background music during the races).<br><br>The game is played from a top-down perspective. The car moves only in the vertical direction (from bottom to top), with turns being up to 45\u00b0 to the right or to the left (with 90\u00b0 turns when the car leaves a 45\u00b0 turn to enter another in the opposite direction). One button is used to accelerate, the other to change gears (low or high). Cars can take damage and the fuel supply is limited. Pit stops are required to fix car damage and to refuel.", "platform": "Sega Master System", "release_date": "July 2, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.28", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2884"}
