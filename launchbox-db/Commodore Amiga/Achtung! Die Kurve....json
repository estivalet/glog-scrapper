{"altername_name": ["Dune III: Achtung Die Kurve", "Achtung! Die Kurve"], "name": "Achtung! Die Kurve...", "overview": "This is a curious shareware game that plays like a multi player version of the well known game Snake, which looks and plays very similar to \u010cervii. The game title means to Watch the Curve. Like in Snake, you control a \"snake\" that continuously grows, the object being to stay alive for as long as possible. However unlike Snake, this is by default a multi player game, the object here is to stay in contention the longest. Running into yourself, another players snake, or going out of bounds ends your turn. Players are given points based on how long they last.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hero Music Company", "publishers": "Hero Music Company", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "6", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/373697-achtung-die-kurve\n"}
