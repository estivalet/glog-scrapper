{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tracers", "overview": "In the future all computers are connected to one central mainframe so a force called Tracers are created to stop hackers entering the computer by mind and stealing or corrupting vital data. You play a Tracer and you must enter the computer with your mind and play a battle of wits against a hacker who can be played by the computer or a friend. Tracers is a Light-Cycle game where the game is viewed from above so your Tracer Module and your opponent are represented by squares. As each module moves it leaves behind a growing trail of data and if one of the modules touches a trail then they get their brain fried and after so many 'Burns' the person thrown out of the computer. Hackerdust can be found to raise your intolerance slightly to the burn. You can't control the speed of the module, just steer it but you can give yourself a limited short burst of speed. The whole arena is shown on the screen and a joystick used to control the modules.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Hacker Corp", "publishers": "MicroIllusions", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/128265-tracers\n"}
