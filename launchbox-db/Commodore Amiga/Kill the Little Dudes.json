{"altername_name": [], "name": "Kill the Little Dudes", "overview": "Action platform game involving collecting pods, little dudes and death.We play as an Arnie-type hero, who can jump on platforms and shoot enemies. If you kill them they respawn, so timing is critical. You must collect all the orbs on a level, and after a few you find a bonus stage. For an AMOS game its good fun for a while, and the controls/ladder climbing ability are just about sharp enough for early levels. On later levels, new enemies are introduced; which means it gets a lot more difficult, and some later levels feel a bit unfair.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Craig Burlock", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQZIwF3vNek", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161892-kill-the-little-dudes\n"}
