{"altername_name": [], "name": "Iridon", "overview": "Iridon is a traditional, vertically scrolling shooter. The player's mission is simple: destroying 50 huge space ships by flying over them and destroying all buildings on them. However, there are a few obstacles: flying against a building or a space mine results in instant death. Also deadly are the missiles of the enemy defender ships, but touching the ships itself is allowed. After finishing the exterior of a mother ship, the player enters its interior which basically play out the same, just destroying vehicles instead of buildings.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Kingsoft", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/128137-iridon\n"}
