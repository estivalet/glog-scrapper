{"altername_name": ["King's Table: The Legend of Ragnarok", "King's Table: The Legend of Ragnarok"], "name": "The Legend of Ragnarok", "overview": "A version of an old Norse board game called King's Table. The game has black and white teams, like chess, but each team has different pieces and a different raison d'etre. The white team has a total of 13 pieces, the most important one being Odin the King, who starts in the centre of the 10x10 board and moves in the same way as a chess King, whereas black has 20 pawns and four other pieces. White wins if Odin can reach one of the corner squares; black wins if it surrounds Odin on all 4 sides. The pawns actually move the same way as chess queens, but pieces are captured by surrounding them on 2 sides (although some special pieces must be surrounded on 3 sides). The specials are chosen from the selection at the start of the game, and have a variety of abilities, some 'borrowed' from chess.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Imagitec Design", "publishers": "Mirage Technologies (Multimedia) Ltd.", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/Z-ylW4hRYvs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/71944-the-legend-of-ragnarok\n"}
