{"altername_name": ["Fluch Des Drachen, Der", "Auge des Drachen, Das"], "name": "Eye of the Dragon", "overview": "Eye of the Dragon is a nice little Mahjong game. The game offers a no-frills, no-nonsense Mahjong experience. If you don't know how to play the game, this one isn't for you as it doesn't provide any rules or guidance to introduce you to the game. If you already know how to play, though, the game provides a decent enough challenge for a quick Mahjong fix. If you are a Mahjong fan, there's probably nothing better than being able to quickly jump into a game, during that precious 10-15 minutes coffee break.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Mac Soft", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/91095-eye-of-the-dragon\n"}
