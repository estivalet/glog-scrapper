{"altername_name": ["Gloom 3: Zombie Edition"], "name": "Ultimate Gloom", "overview": "Ultimate Gloom aka Gloom 3: Zombie Edition is a first-person shooter game, developed by Alpha and published by Guildhall Leisure Services Ltd., which was released in 1997. Using the Gloom Deluxe engine, Gareth Murfin of Alpha Software released the third in the Gloom series. The use of the same engine as the last game is both a strength and a weakness; the engine is good but its single plane levels restricts the variety that can be achieved. This time the character of Gloom and Gloom Deluxe is up against an outbreak of zombies. Everyone loves zombies (well, nearly) and loves taking them out.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Alpha Software", "publishers": "Guildhall Leisure Services", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/131580-ultimate-gloom\n"}
