{"altername_name": [], "name": "Blocks", "overview": "The precursor to Blocks XL, a columns clone on the Amiga from Engine Nine Design coded by Matt Briggs. It involves arranging falling blocks in such a way as to clear them. They are groups of 3 same-size but varying color blocks, which must be arranged into sequences of 3 or more, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Sequences of 4 or 5 count for double or triple points, and diagonal sequences score the most. The real trick is to set up 'combos' - where one line causes other blocks to drop so as to create other lines.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1998", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Engine Nine Design", "publishers": "", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162690-blocks\n"}
