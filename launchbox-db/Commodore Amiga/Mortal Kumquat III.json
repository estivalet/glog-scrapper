{"altername_name": ["Mortal Kumquat"], "name": "Mortal Kumquat III", "overview": "Mortal Kumquat III (a.k.a. Fruit Fighter II Turbo G.T.I. XL 4x4) is a fighting game parody for the Amiga. It requires two players with joysticks. Each player controls one of two fighters: a green character named \"Mo-Shi-P\", and an orange character named \"Ho-Ran-G\". Both have their own special finishing move when they win a fight. The first player to win two rounds wins the overall game. Pressing the joystick fire button on its own has no effect, you also need to move the joystick in a direction at the same time: towards the other player to punch, away from the other player to block, diagonally up-left or up-right to do a spinning jump, and so on. Before you play, the game goes through several decision screens (including choosing the title of the game itself) that ultimately have no effect on gameplay at all. Mortal Kumquat III was created exclusively for Amiga Action magazine, to be included as a coverdisk game on the July 1995 issue.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "July 1, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gadge Software", "publishers": "Europress Software", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrWNcdCNAhU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164297-mortal-kumquat-iii\n"}
