{"altername_name": [], "name": "Particle Man", "overview": "The idea with Particle Man is to collect and dispose of a number of bombs which are placed in the maze at random by the monsters. The bombs have a limited life and if left alone for too long will explode. If this happens, Particle Man loses some energy and if all his energy is lost he loses a life. A collision with any of the monsters also results in a lost life. As a warning, when a bomb's timer is below the half-way stage, it will flash. To dispose of a bomb you must absorb it. If the bombs are close together, run over the one you want an press fire. If far apart PM will absorb the first bomb he encounters. Once absorbed PM can dispose of the bomb by running over a portal. The game could be best described as somewhat of a reverse Bomber Man.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMu4xZcnNdQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162013-particle-man\n"}
