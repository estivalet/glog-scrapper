{"altername_name": ["Jumps Dragon Ball"], "name": "Dragon Ball Jumps", "overview": "A remake of the classic Circus\\Seesaw Jump game for the Amiga, with Dragon Ball characters to make things more interesting. You can pick up special items and avoid baddies in the windows. You move the seesaw under your characters to keep them both jumping, making sure they come down on the correct side of the seesaw and the accuracy at which they hit determines the arc and height of the jump. This game features adult art at the end of each level so while never rated, this should be considered a mature game.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Balance Games", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6cF7sV4Eo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165008-dragon-ball-jumps\n"}
