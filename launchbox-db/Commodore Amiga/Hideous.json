{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hideous", "overview": "A shooter/platformer game for Amiga & Amiga emulators. I originally released this game in July 1993. Hideous was originally named Sentinel and was inspired by the game Zamzara for Commodore 64. My most ambitious game to date, Sentinel took many months of work and was signed to a start-up publisher during development, but the publisher vanished overnight when the game was finished, so it was renamed and released as licenceware by 5th Dimension Software. The game is generally joystick controlled and you have several weapons at your disposal: Space for smart bomb, right shift for missile, left shift for mine web, pull down and hold for death scream. Hideous struggles with graphical glitches and appears to be most stable on v1.2 Amiga 500 systems.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Scorpius", "publishers": "5th Dimension", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161161-hideous\n"}
