{"altername_name": [], "name": "Aniso", "overview": "Aniso is a puzzle game, that is simple to understand but hard to master. In it, you have two grids (from 3*3 to 8*8). One of the grids is filled with numbers while the other one is empty. The idea behind the game is to form an image of the first grid to the second. When you click one of the squares inside the grid, the square and its immediate neighbors will get a \"1\" in them. The numbers will be incremented by one on each click, with a wraparound after four. Additionally, you can only click a square just once.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1999", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Barry McConnell", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/159586-aniso\n"}
