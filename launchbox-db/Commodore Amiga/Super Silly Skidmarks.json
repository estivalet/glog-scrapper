{"altername_name": [], "name": "Super Silly Skidmarks", "overview": "A 2D, overhead-view Kart style racing game for up to four players, commercially released in 1998 as part of the ULTIMATE SUPER SKIDMARKS compilation. It is a version of Super Skidmarks with comical sound effects and a bunch of different vehicles. There are a number of circuits provided, all of them with walls around them to ensure crash-bang-wallop racing, and most of them have parts that cross with other parts, making collisions possible if you're much ahead of (or behind) other cars (fortunately there's no car damage). They can be raced forwards or backward - perhaps the first game with this feature available. You could either run single races, or one of the in-built championships - one for each car, across a specially selected set of tracks.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Acid", "publishers": "Acid (Guildhall)", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZXpvhXPpd4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165510-super-silly-skidmarks\n"}
