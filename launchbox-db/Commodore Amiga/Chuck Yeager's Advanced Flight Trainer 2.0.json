{"altername_name": [], "name": "Chuck Yeager's Advanced Flight Trainer 2.0", "overview": "Chuck Yeager's Advanced Flight Trainer 2.0 is a Simulation game, developed by Eldritch The Cat and published by Electronic Arts, which was released in Europe in 1991. Chuck Yeager is a big man among big men. The USA respects success, and no-one has been more successful at flying American aircraft than him. From his incredible performance in World War II to pioneering the supersonic rocket series, he\u2019s sought to be the best. So there\u2019s none more qualified to train you in advanced flight. As Chuck can fly anything with wings, then so can you. While the controls are sensitive and \u2018lifelike\u2019, the graphics don\u2019t update quickly, leading to the off-putting impression that you\u2019re just wallowing around in a very jerky sky. It\u2019s a pity because the graphics would otherwise be acceptable. Combine this with the slow speed, and the program doesn\u2019t really come up to the slick level set by most Amiga flight sims today. The lack of any particularly exciting things to do means that long-term gameplay suffers. If you like general aviation rather than combat, and fancy trying your hand as a formation pilot, you might find AFT reaches your itch. But sadly for most, the program doesn\u2019t quite come up to scratch.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Eldritch the Cat", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Flight Simulator", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.58", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Yeager%27s_Advanced_Flight_Trainer", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/63399-chuck-yeagers-advanced-flight-trainer-20\n"}
