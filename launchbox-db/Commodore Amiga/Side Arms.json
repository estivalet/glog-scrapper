{"altername_name": ["Side Arms Hyper Dyne"], "name": "Side Arms", "overview": "Originating in the arcades, Side Arms is a horizontally scrolling shoot \u2018em up in which you control Lieutenant Henry (a second player can control Sergeant Sanders in some versions), armed with crude weaponry and protective jump-suits. They must save the earth from the mercenary invaders of Bozon. You must first reach Bozon\u2019s territories, then wipe out its forces hidden in caverns and lurking in underground seas, before destroying the main invasion ship. Lots of extra weapons can be picked up, often with similar tokens to those in 1943 and some other Capcom titles. Most weapons can be shot either to the left or the right, giving you more range to launch attacks.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Probe Software", "publishers": "Go!", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.33", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper_Dyne_Side_Arms#Ports", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/80292-side-arms\n"}
