{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Enforcer (Eurosoft)", "overview": "I can barely bring myself to write anything about this appalling bag of camel poo. Direness of the highest level. This game consists of a series of puny sub-games, almost all of which seem to be entirely unplayable. The first of these makes you attempt to put together a gun by moving a band of weapon pieces so they are hit by bullets. Half of the pieces are hit by bullets within the first few seconds of them being on the screen, so you loose this almost instantly. The second sub-game is one of those police training shoot things where various cardboard gangsters and civilians slide along the screen. Now being British I assumed that anyone carrying a gun on public is probably a danger to society, so I shot everyone who had a gun in their hands. Obviously not. A message flashed up that I had made to many mistakes and that I was fired. And that to be quite honest was as far as I played. It might be there's a brilliant shoot'em up or something hidden the other side of this tedium. However I doubt it.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Methodic Solutions", "publishers": "Eurosoft", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90733-the-enforcer-eurosoft\n"}
