When the Lionheart is stolen, the armies of the enemy begin to mobilise against the king and his people. As Valdyn aka \"Lionheart\", you will have to travel deep into the territory of your king's enemy to retrieve the stolen holy relic. WARNING: This game is inclined to unleash waves of enthusiasm. This is what the critics in the trade press say: \"An absolute smash hit ... one of the best Amiga games of all time.\" AMIGA GAMES \"In future, Lionheart will be the name for technical superiority, audio-visual perfection and sheer magnificence. What Thalion's development team has achieved with this title is simply superb.\" PLAY TIME \"Without any doubt, Thalion's game will go down as one of the technically best action games in Amiga's history.\" AMIGA GAMES", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "March 1, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Thalion Software", "publishers": "Thalion Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.33", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionheart_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/29553-lionheart\n"}
