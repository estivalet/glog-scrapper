{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mini Golf Plus", "overview": "Mini Golf Plus is a mini golf game with 18 holes. The course is based on a real mini golf location, but features a few additional gimmicks like a crocodile which tries to snatch the ball. The game is controlled with the mouse: for every hit, the player sets the direction by putting a cursor somewhere on the course. However, this is only viable in a certain radius around the ball. The hit is performed with the left mouse button and the strength depends on how long it is hold. The main playing window is in a top-down perspective, but there's also a smaller window with a 3D perspective for better orientation.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "January 18, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Starbyte Software", "publishers": "Starbyte Software", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "10", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/101055-mini-golf-plus\n"}
