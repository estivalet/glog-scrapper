{"altername_name": ["Backgammon (Robtek)"], "name": "Championship Backgammon", "overview": "An earlier form of this game was being played thousands of ears ago. It has since evolved into an enthralling game, in which chance and tactics go hand in hand. The object of the game is to be the first one to get all your pieces home and to move them outside the board. Barriers are set up on the way and double bets serve to heighten the tension. Once you are engrossed in the game, you will quickly discover why the game has survived all these centuries.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Exodus-Soft", "publishers": "Robtek", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/163659-championship-backgammon\n"}
