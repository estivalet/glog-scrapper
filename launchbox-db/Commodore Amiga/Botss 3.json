{"altername_name": [], "name": "Botss 3", "overview": "It is two years after Botss 2. President Gilbert Bates is dead. Zackaria is presumed gone. The EDF becomes less vigilant. Earth Force space station Z35 is attacked. The five pilots who fought Zackaria before were not onboard the station when the attack came. The station is quickly overwhelmed. Mars Force DRAGON jumps into Earth Force space attacking immediately. The EDF tries valiantly but cannot hold. DRAGON uses the antimatter cannon and the defenses are obliterated, save a handful of fighters. With the station taken and the crew mind-probed, the strike to earth has begun. Only you can save us, our last line of defense.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1998", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Parallel Realities", "publishers": "", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3yPU9QMuY8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161830-botss-3\n"}
