The player character has a sword to attack the hordes of spiders, insects and wasps with, as well as fireballs which require mana. Plenty of other weapons are on offer throughout the lair the protagonist is initially trapped in. There's a full magic system to get to grips with, and plenty of spells to collect, use and unravel. There are also puzzles that must be solved to advance.
