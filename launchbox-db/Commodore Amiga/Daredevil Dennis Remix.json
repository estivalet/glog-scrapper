{"altername_name": [], "name": "Daredevil Dennis Remix", "overview": "This is a game written for the Amiga Blitz basic Game Jam by Havie55 and their crew. \"Daredevil Dennis is a platform game where the player takes the role of Daredevil Dennis, a stuntman. Dennis must use a variety of vehicles (motorbike, jet-ski and ski-doo) to perform a number of stunts. The only controls are accelerate, brake and jump. The screen is split into four platforms. When the character leaves the end of one, he appears at the start of the next. On most levels, there are gaps in the platforms where the character can fall through and land on the platforms below. There are many hazards scattered across the platforms that must be avoided. These range from static objects like trees and houses to moving objects such as jumping policemen and speeding ambulances. If Dennis hits any of these objects, he is flung from his vehicle as it bursts into flames and he must start again (with 'take 2'). If he crashes too many times, he is 'fired'. Points are given in the form of a wage. The game has 25 levels of increasing difficulty. Can you get to the end?", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "October 31, 2022", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Havsoft", "publishers": "", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB7K3Du0fQE", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/167261-daredevil-dennis-remix\n"}
