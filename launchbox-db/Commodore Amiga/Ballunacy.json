{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ballunacy", "overview": "The basic concept of the game is simple: you have to guide the ball around the play area destroying all the pods, then head for the exit before the time runs out by placing deflectors around the field. Once placed the deflectors cannot be removed, but their orientation can be altered. There's also various tokens lying around which will either hinder or help you by altering the ball speed, destroying it, changing the remaining time or turning it indestructable, giving it the ability to break through the walls.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mark Seymour", "publishers": "F1 Licenceware", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/160727-ballunacy\n"}
