{"altername_name": [], "name": "M1 Tank Platoon", "overview": "A very encompassing game that allowed players to issue orders to Tanks, AA units, Aircraft, Artillery and Infantry in a campaign against Warsaw Pact units in Europe, while specifically controlling a platoon of 4 M1 tanks. The player could jump into the position of the driver, gunner or commander of any of the tanks to view the world from a 1st person perspective, or work from a tactical map to command all his forces. Characters in the M1 platoon actually increased in skill as they survived battles.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "MicroProse", "publishers": "MicroProse", "genres": "Vehicle Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.38", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M1_Tank_Platoon", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F57ad4qG2B4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/74428-m1-tank-platoon\n"}
