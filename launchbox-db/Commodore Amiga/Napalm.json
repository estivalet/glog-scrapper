{"altername_name": ["Napalm: The Crimson Crisis"], "name": "Napalm", "overview": "The first major Command & Conquer style game for the Amiga, in which intelligent robots have rebelled and are attempting to wipe out humanity. You can play as either side, and must face a succession of missions, all of which involve attempting to wipe out the opposition's base and units. The two sides have a subtly different range of units, but all the same buildings must be produced to produce and service these. Oil must be mined for money, and the enemy AI is particularly keen on cutting off your resources if it feels that you don't have many units. This is just one example of a fairly complex AI routine, which combines with some unusual level designs to make the game quite challenging and lifelike.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ablaze Entertainment", "publishers": "PXL computers", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napalm:_The_Crimson_Crisis", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/128178-napalm\n"}
