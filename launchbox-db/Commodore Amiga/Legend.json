{"altername_name": ["The Four Crystals Of Trazere"], "name": "Legend", "overview": "Legend uses an isometric perspective, giving the player an overall picture of the surroundings and the chance to independently control each of the four-man team. Initially, the player is given four heroic characters: a Wizard, a Bard, a Fighter and an Assassin. Combat is played in real-time with the player given control over each of your men. Fighters tend to look after themselves, but your wizard will require precise moves when aiming and casting spells. As with other games of this ilk, you will find many magical items and weapons left scattered around the many dungeons, including mystical spells. Legend's action takes place across a number of areas, both above and below ground. A map of the play area can be displayed at any time, and it is over this that your merry band travel between strongholds using conveniently-located horses. Upon the arrival at each stronghold you can visit the usual array of Taverns, Guilds, Shops and Temples to buy health and goodies with money made killing monsters. In addition, the dungeons are littered with old chests stuffed with scrolls, keys and potions. Your team is nicely animated, and the dungeons are similarly well illustrated. Initially, I must admit that I wasn't a fan of Legend's arcade-style adventuring. However, brilliant additional touches, such as the spell mixing and the realistic combat sequences soon won me over.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Mindscape", "publishers": "Mindscape", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.92", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legend_(1992_video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6HcxcEyq9U", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72269-legend\n"}
