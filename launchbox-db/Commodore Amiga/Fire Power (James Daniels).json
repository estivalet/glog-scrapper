In this game, which supports up to 6 players, with any number of them as computer controlled, one person only acts as the driver OR the gunner of each tank, not both! The screen is divided into 3 sections, one for each team. Great party game to see who can act as an effective team!", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "James Daniels", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "6", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT6I8qajv20", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162449-fire-power-james-daniels\n"}
