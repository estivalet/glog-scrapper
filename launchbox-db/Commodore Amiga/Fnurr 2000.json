{"altername_name": [], "name": "Fnurr 2000", "overview": "Game created by Richard DawnBringer Fhager is simple yet incredibly playable. You control a single pixel being chased by 25 other pixels. If two or more pixels collide they explode. If any of the enemy pixels get caught in an explosion they also explode. If you hit any enemy or explosions you die! You score n^3 points for the pixels that collide at the SAME time!You also get 1 point/sec for staying alive. The longer a single enemy pixel is alive, the faster it gets. Luckily you get a little bit of a head start. New pixels will respawn after a bit.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2000", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Richard Fhager", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162834-fnurr-2000\n"}
