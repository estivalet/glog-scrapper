{"altername_name": [], "name": "SideShow", "overview": "This is the third light-gun game for the Commodore Amiga. It is a collection of eight arcade-style games that take place at a carnival. The scenario is that the player arrives at the carnival and has tokens to play the various mini-games. These mini-games include shooting balloons, throwing knives at a clown, the water dunk tank, the haunted hill, shooting balls, a hammer strength test, and the clock shoppe. This was one of the first video games that allowed players to import their own images and place themselves inside the game (referred to as \u2018InterActor\u2019 on the game box).", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Actionware", "publishers": "Actionware", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/108317-sideshow\n"}
