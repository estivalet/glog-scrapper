{"altername_name": [], "name": "More! Lemmings", "overview": "During the early part of this year 2016, it was the 25th Anniversary of DMA Design's ' Lemmings '. A game published by Psygnosis way back in the early 90's for the Amiga, Atari ST and PC and regarded by many as one of the greatest games ever and featured many blue, green haired Lemmings that could be blown up, ripped apart and dropped from the highest of points before they even hope to reach that exit. But it wasn't just the digging, blocking and thought worthy gameplay that made people love it so, but it had some really chippy tunes that sound great today, even remixed! Thus as a special release by Amiga Jay he has unofficially released the More! Lemmings extravaganza on the Amiga CD32. So what is this More! Lemmings you might ask? Well as we mentioned above, Lemmings did appear on the PC but Amiga Jay has noted the Amiga didn't get much of a look in various level editors and clones, with new no levels in over 20 years! And so here we are on the Amiga CD32 with 120 new levels to play through, that have never been seen on the Amiga before. But that's not all, as not only has he made these levels available for the CDTV and via ADF, but AJ has made available his Lemmings - The Ports PDF book containing over 300 pages all about the different Lemmings ports absolutely free!", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2016", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "AmigaJay", "publishers": "Psygnosis", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "http://hol.abime.net/6243", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/j5LHemvtvCo?t=202", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165503-more-lemmings\n"}
