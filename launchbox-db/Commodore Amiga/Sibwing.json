Also thanks of course goes to Earok, and the original developers Acid Software!\" Get your mission objectives, take out the sentries protecting the objective target, but you'll need to take out the power sources for them or they will blast you out of the skies. Keep your eyes on those skies as enemy ships will appear and try to take you out.
