{"altername_name": ["Rush'n Attack"], "name": "Green Beret", "overview": "Green Beret is a run and gun game developed and released by Konami in arcades in 1985. It was ported to home systems, becoming a critical and commercial success for arcades and home computers. It was released as Green Beret internationally, and as Rush'n Attack in North America as a play on \"Russian attack\" due to its Cold War setting. It is remembered for this Cold War setting and its reliance on the player using mainly a knife to dispatch enemies, although you were able to collect many different weapons including the flame thrower. Developer Dante Mendes has finally released the Arcade conversion of Green Beret which has been developed for the Amiga using Earok's Scorpion Engine.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "January 30, 2022", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dante Mendes", "publishers": "itch.io", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush'n_Attack", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omUQQHARYU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/158650-green-beret\n"}
