{"altername_name": ["Othello Basic"], "name": "Amiga Othello", "overview": "ack in 1985, the first Amiga 1000 computers came with the ABasiC programming language by Metacomco. Unfortunately ABasiC does not work under Kickstart 2.0 (V36) and later, but can be patched to fix the problem. David Addison wrote some excellent games in ABasiC including Amiga Othello, written in 1986. The David Addison games originally appeared on Fred Fish disks 28. Amiga Othello is an implementation of the board game of the same name. Players take turns placing tokens on the board, tokens that are surrounded by two tokens of another color change color. When the board is full, the player with the most tokens of their color on the board wins the game.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "David Addison", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164413-amiga-othello\n"}
