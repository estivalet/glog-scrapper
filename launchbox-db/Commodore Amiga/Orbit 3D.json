{"altername_name": [], "name": "Orbit 3D", "overview": "\"ORBIT 3D\" I SCENARIO: You are the pilot of a small space vehicle in orbit, along with your Mother Ship, around a large black hole in space. Your vechicle is supplied with oxygen for life support, fuel for maneuvering, and torpedoes for destruction of asteroids captured by the gravitational force of the black hole. The object of the game is simply to survive in orbit as long as possible. To refill your supplies of oxygen, fuel, and torpedoes, you must successfully rendezvous and dock with the Mother Ship. To preserve these vital supplies, you must protect the Mother Ship from destruction. MODES OF PLAY: The game can be played as a 3D projection, \"Run 3D\", or as a red-blue dual image projection requiring the use of red-blue 3D glasses, \"Run Dual 30\" Three modes of operation are provided called \"Learn\", \"Play\", and \"Demo\". In the Learn mode, you have unlimited oxygen, fuel, and torpedoes, and neither you nor the Mother Ship can be destroyed. The Learn mode allows you to practice maneuvering in orbit without being immediately destroyed.
