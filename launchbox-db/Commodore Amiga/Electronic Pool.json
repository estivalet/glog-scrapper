{"altername_name": ["Pool"], "name": "Electronic Pool", "overview": "Electronic Pool is a simplified cue sports game with only six billiard balls on the table. The game offers two different game modes. In 1-player mode your goal is to pocket the balls in as few shots as possible and try to get as high a score as possible. Missing too many shots means an early game over. In 2-player mode you try to get more points than your opponent to win the game.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "MicroDeal Ltd.", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/92777-electronic-pool\n"}
