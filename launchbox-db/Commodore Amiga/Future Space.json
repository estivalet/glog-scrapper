{"altername_name": [], "name": "Future Space", "overview": "The plot of Future Space can be summed up easily: Evil aliens attack Earth and the player, in the role of an experienced fighter, has to kill them. Unfortunately his space ship crash landed and his whole crew died - now the mission has to be concluded on foot. The game features about 30 stages in which the player basically needs to walk from left to right while shooting all opposition with one of the two hand guns - touching the enemies is not advised as it eventually leads to death. However, the exit at the end only opens when all scattered diamonds were collected. To make matters worse, there is also a time limit for each level.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Media Verlagsgesellschaft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/131254-future-space\n"}
