{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ultra Violent Worlds", "overview": "In the year 2305, the Zarnaxians suddenly entered Earth territory and within an hour the colony on Mars was captured. Zarnaxians ships next targeted the Earth itself when major cities were destroyed. In a final blow, the Moon was crashed onto the Earth using the graviton rays of the largest Zarnaxians ships. With Earth's defence forces annihilated, there is little hope for the remaining human survivors. Unless someone brave enough could stand up and liberate the Earth and the Mars colony... Ultra Violent Words is a top down shoot'em up that offers 4 levels of action, 256 colour AGA graphics, 3 layer parallax scrolling and two player simultaneous gameplay.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "July 1, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Vorlon Software", "publishers": "Alive Mediasoft", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg35pwrDY_U", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/131581-ultra-violent-worlds\n"}
