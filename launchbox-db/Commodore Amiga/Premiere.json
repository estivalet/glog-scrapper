{"altername_name": [], "name": "Premiere", "overview": "The sets are themed around six different genres of film, and the backdrops, weapons and enemies fit these sections. There is a slapstick comedy played out in black and white (complete with greyscale background) a cartoon with lots of Road Runnering and goofy facial expressions, a Wild West romp, Sci-Fi complete with aliens, and so on. After each platform level you will have to pass through a film scene - piloting a runaway mine-cart, navigating a scrolling shoot 'em up level, or similar.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Core Design", "publishers": "Core Design", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.97", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkraANoOU2E", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/9850-premiere\n"}
