{"altername_name": [], "name": "Steel Devils", "overview": "Steel Devils is an action game published by German company Wolf Software & Design via their label Oase Software. The game is an arena fighter where two mechs try to destroy each other. There is no single player mode, only two human players can play against each other at the same time. The game uses a top-down view. Players compete in an arena which consists of a single screen. There are 20 different arenas to choose from. Each arena has a different layout with indestructible obstacles. Power-ups will appear randomly on screen. These include temporary invisibility, several weapons, mines or health supply. A player is destroyed once his health is drained. Then the other player scores a point and the duel starts anew, until one player has reached a pre-set number of points.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Joacjim Mertens", "publishers": "OASE", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "8", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMainKV4xE0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164657-steel-devils\n"}
