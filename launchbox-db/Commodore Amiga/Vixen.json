{"altername_name": ["She-Fox"], "name": "Vixen", "overview": "The planet Granath has been under seige for as long as the sky has met with the horizon, and for as long as the mountains have rolled into the distance. For Granath, a world in a parallel universe many eons away, has been at the mercy of the dinosaurs. For millions of years they roamed the planet's surface and its massive underground caves in search of their prey. They have destroyed all but a few of the mammals, and all of the humans. Or have they? For a powerful lone female figure still stalks and battles with the reptiles. The cataclysmic catastrophe that hit the scaled beasts on Earth many millions of years ago has not happened here. It is a different world - very different. VIXEN, found abandoned as a child and raised by the wily foxes, has magic powers bestowed on her by the Fox Sages. With her ability to metamophosize into a fox and her Magic Whip in hand, she is fierce, brave and a match for any of her foes.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Intelligent Design", "publishers": "Martech Games", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vixen_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/91798-vixen\n"}
