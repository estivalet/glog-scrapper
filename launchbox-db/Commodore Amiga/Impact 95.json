{"altername_name": [], "name": "Impact 95", "overview": "When was the last time you said \"Just one more game\" at 10 o'clock, but were still paying at 3am? When you fell in love with a game within minutes of opening the box? IMPACT unashamedly takes you back to the days when games were about fun, and didn't need 17 disks, or manuals two feet thick. When your kid brother, or grandmother could join in without anyone getting embarrassed! The concept is simple - knock bricks out of the wall, one by one, until you've cleared the screen. Catch the glittering tokes that fall and you'll be able to trade them for powerful weapons - wide bat, multi-ball, laser, and missiles are just for of the options. IMPACT has 80 classic levels, plus 48 bonus levels that you can change yourself. Make them as hard, as simple, as much fun as you like! If you thought the fun had gone out of computer games, then this is the game that'll change your mind.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Audiogenic Software", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "http://hol.abime.net/2617", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTyB9_sysj8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165483-impact-95\n"}
