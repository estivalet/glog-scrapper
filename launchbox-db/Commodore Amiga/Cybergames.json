{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cybergames", "overview": "You will face different opponents ranging in skills from mediocre to very tough to beat. There are 35 opponents and six locations in the complete game. Since this is a fighting game, the object obviously is to smash the other guy. You can either beat him with your weapon until he has lost all of his energy, or you can make it short by separating his head from the body (A Swedish shave). Decent graphics, much better than in many commercial releases, but unfortunately animation is weak and control over the fighters is horrible. You can get used to it, but after some time it becomes tiresome. Nevertheless, if the game was a bit polished, it could have been quite good.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Cyberpunk Developments", "publishers": "XAKK", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/89724-cybergames\n"}
