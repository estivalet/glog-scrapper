{"altername_name": [], "name": "Orbital", "overview": "The object of the game is to clear the screen of all coloured balls, within the given time limit. To do this you need to bring together 3 or more balls of the same colour, in a vertical or horizontal manner. This will then cause the matching balls to promptly disappear. Spinning a ball changes its colour, you can change any colour apart from Grey. There are four zones ranging from easy to nearly impossible and 3 levels per zone to overcome. You can also choose a timed game or a faster, albeit slightly harder Logic Game.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "November 1, 1993", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Challenge Logic", "publishers": "", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164394-orbital\n"}
