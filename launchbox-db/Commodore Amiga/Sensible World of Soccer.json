{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sensible World of Soccer", "overview": "Sensible World of Soccer is an enhanced version of Sensible Soccer. Virtually every important soccer league in the world is included in this game, with some countries not only having premier / first division, but 2nd, 3rd, and more divisions. All important international competitions are also included (club- and national-team based). The game has a career mode, where you may play up to 20 seasons as player manager or manager only. During a career as a coach you're not tied to one club / national team, meaning if you're good enough one (or more) big clubs make offers to you to coach their team.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Sensible Software", "publishers": "Renegade", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.59", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/12510-sensible-world-of-soccer\n"}
