{"altername_name": ["Steel Empire"], "name": "Cyber Empires", "overview": "Predecessor to the highly succesful (and more complex) Fantasy Empires. A tactical and strategic turn-based game of robotic combat, land conquest, and city siege. This game was released by Silicon Knights in March 1992. It was voted the best multi-player game in 1992 by Computer Game Review. Five empires descend upon the neutral and strategic planet of Orion in an attempt to claim it as their own. The days of conventional warfare are over and the age of the cybernetic warrior is at hand. The game is a mix of strategy and battle action. First it has a strategic part where you build factories, cyborgs, gain control over new countries, plan your next moves, schedule attacks and build defences. Once you and the computer have completed your turns, its time for action - attack, defence or occupation. To win the game you need to defeat the enemies with your armies of cyborgs. Size of the cyborgs varies from the smallest type called Mercury to TITAN which is the largest one available. Each of the cyborgs carry various weapons in their arsenal. The cyborgs can be controlled either by keyboard or joystick. You can issue various orders to your cyborgs before the battle begins, and set how strictly they will follow them.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Silicon Knights", "publishers": "Millennium Interactive", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "5", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber_Empires", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/85733-cyber-empires\n"}
