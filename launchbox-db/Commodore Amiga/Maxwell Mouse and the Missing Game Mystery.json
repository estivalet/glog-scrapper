{"altername_name": [], "name": "Maxwell Mouse and the Missing Game Mystery", "overview": "A flip-screen platform/adventure game with influences from Dizzy and old 8-bit platformers. It features a 29-screen level, with a number of puzzles to solve and characters to converse with, as Maxwell the Mouse attempts to retrieve an Amiga game mysteriously taken from his home. Maxwell the cool blue mouse (who insists on wearing sunglasses and a backpack) had just woken up after a very pleasant night's sleep. He was excited because just yesterday, he had gone and bought a fabulous new Amiga game. He had given the game pride of place in his special disk box ready to be played as soon as he got up that morning. But disaster had struck. The disk wasn't there. The box was empty. It hadn't been left in his Amiga's disk drive. In fact, it was nowhere to be seen. \"Oh, botheration! My floppy diskette appears to have gone missing. This is a most unfortunate turn of events\", is something Maxwell didn't quite say but as it's before the watershed... well, that was the gist of it. There's only one real explanation - someone must have got in, somehow, and stolen it. But how? Who? Why? In the absence of anything worthwhile to do, Maxwell decides to go on a little adventure to try and retrieve his game. After all, it's a small village, and there are one or two shady characters lurking about. Not everyone likes Maxwell and indeed, not everyone likes the Amiga...", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "January 10, 2015", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Remainder Software", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leyLSFCQTfg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162012-maxwell-mouse-and-the-missing-game-mystery\n"}
