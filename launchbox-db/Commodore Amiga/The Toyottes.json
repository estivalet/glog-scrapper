{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Toyottes", "overview": "The Toyottes is a really fun looking game, but unfortunately, the graphics are the best thing about it. Quite humorous graphics can draw you into the game. An average use of colour, but the backdrops are pretty bland. Couple this with lots going on, and you get a very confusing play. Also some good music, with a good variety of sound effects during the game. Overall, they add to the humour of the graphics quite well. The basic idea is pretty good, and fighting the various monsters is quite fun, but once you've seen most of the screens and baddies the game loses its addictiveness and appeal. As far as platform games go, Toyottes isn't that great and not really something I can recommend.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Infogrames", "publishers": "Infogrames", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-HUHkcctfU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73678-the-toyottes\n"}
