{"altername_name": [], "name": "Willy's Weirdy Nightmare", "overview": "Written in AMOS Professional. Coding by Richard Williams. Graphics & music by Steven Tate. Game features save game support and a quit back to WB option (by pressing CTRL-C). Based unofficially on 1984 Matthew Smith/Software Projects Spectrum release JET SET WILLY, but updated for the Amiga. . Each room has its own hazards, such as spikes, guardians (ranging from demonic heads to giant penknives), and ropes which can be climbed and grasped in mid-air. Touching a monster or a stationary hazard, or falling a great distance, causes instant loss of a life and places Willy back at the room entrance. The route through the house must be navigated carefully, due to the multiple entrances to some rooms - this is perhaps the first action game where mapping is an advantage.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Richard Williams", "publishers": "F1 Licenceware", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1EvkVvvyDg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162049-willys-weirdy-nightmare\n"}
