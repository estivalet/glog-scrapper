{"altername_name": [], "name": "Boomeraid", "overview": "Strange game, but fun concept, especially if you're learning algebra in school at the same time. You play some crocodile Dundee clone, killing evildoers (like hairy people, homeless people or pot smokers) and saving threatened grannies. No, I don't have the background story in mind, but it's probably stupendous. Anyway, the idea is that you have to type equations (or click on their parameters) that get plotted on the screen, and that will become your boomerang's trajectory. You eventually get better boomerangs, that allow you to use more complex equations, allowing your boomerang to follow a more complex path. And this is cool. Seeing that you totally don't believe me, I suggest you try it.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Lemmingsoft Waldoware", "publishers": "TSA Media", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75162-boomeraid\n"}
