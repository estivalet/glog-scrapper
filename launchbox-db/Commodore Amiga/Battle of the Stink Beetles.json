{"altername_name": [], "name": "Battle of the Stink Beetles", "overview": "Battle of the Stink Beetles is a simple tank battle game where the tanks are beetles (chosen from a selection of four) and the ammunition is spit. It's a two player only affair set in one of a choice of six arenas (very Micro Machines style) in which the two combatants trundle about trying to spit at each other. Each beetle also has a set number of mines to drop (once you've picked them from the options menu) in an attempt to harm the other fella and new supplies are delivered by a butterfly 'airforce'. You can even find yourself running from enemy bumblebee 'bombers'. It's mad stuff! What's most impressive with this game though is just how tactical the play becomes. You can't just bimble about firing left, right and centre, you've got to think about what you're doing and make full use of whatever landscape features there are - even to the point of hiding under balls of dung! It's not a laugh a minute but it is good fun. Robert's other trademark is the speech he uses in his games and BOTSB is no exception. It may look ropy and it may be a weird idea but it's good fun to play. Additionally, there are lumps of dung to hide under. No, we don't fully understand how Robert's head works either...", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1997", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Robert W.
