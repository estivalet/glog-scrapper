{"altername_name": [], "name": "Naughty Ones", "overview": "The Naughty Ones come under your control in this old-fashioned platform game. Each screen is separate from the others, and involves trying to collect a key and then progress through the exit. Enemies are best dealt with by shooting one of your longer-range weapons towards them and waiting for it to hit them - this will release at least one coin, for points. Improved weapons can be collected, each of which functions for a limited number of shots. Bonus items are often located in the more precarious parts of the level, leading you to choose whether to risk losing a life, and going back to the start of the screen (although previously killed creatures remain dead when you lose a life).", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Melon Dezign", "publishers": "Interactivision", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.44", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naughty_Ones", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/74502-naughty-ones\n"}
