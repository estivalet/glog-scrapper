{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Holy Grail", "overview": "An outstanding text adventure about the search for the chalice of God. The consequences to be faced if you fail in your mission are dire indeed. Are you up to the challenge? Your travels will take you through some 140 locations and they are so detailed and well written were their descriptions that you may even enjoy wandering into a few dead ends. As Yaggra had said in the introductory text, \"A degree of risk does exist, but any goal worth achieving is made the sweeter by the pleasure of the chase.\" This was an observation with which you surely will concur and your pleasure at reaching the end may only be tempered by the realization that there are no more places to visit or problems to solve.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jim MacBrayne", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/368755-the-holy-grail\n"}
