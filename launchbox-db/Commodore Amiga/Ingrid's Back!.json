{"altername_name": ["Ingrid's Back"], "name": "Ingrid's Back!", "overview": "I\u2019ve never yet met a gnome that I haven\u2019t eaten. In fact, if I ever come across Ingrid in person it\u2019ll bee goodbye Nettlefield, goodbye Flopsy and hello after-dinner snack. Ha! That should keep her away. The last thing I want is tiny busybodies messing up all the billy-goat trophies knocking about in my hole. What do you mean, what am I talking about? You remember Ingrid don\u2019t you? Her mum and dad made the mistake sending her to the institute of Gnome Economics for a bit of education. When she came back, they wished she hadn\u2019t. A faulty transportation scroll was designed to make sure she stayed away for ever (and good riddance). Trouble is, Ingrid came back. This time, one or two people are actually glad to see her. Nothing to do with her absence making the heart grow fonder: gnomes aren\u2019t into all that sentimental claptrap! Nope, it\u2019s more to do with the fact that Jasper Quickbuck has taken over as Little Moaning\u2019s most hated gnome. He\u2019s planning to raze the village to the ground and put a great big enormous yuppy homes development in its place. What a meany! Boo! Hiss! Well, Ingrid won\u2019t stand for it. She\u2019s got her territorial uniform out of storage, sawn off the end of a sub-machine gun and gathered together a few grenades (it doesn\u2019t make her look any better \u2013 what she really needs is a shave) and now she\u2019s ready for some action. Miss Bottomlow\u2019s campaign is conducted in three parts. First off, she has to get as many people as possible to sign a petition. Easier said than done, but somehow she manages it. Not that it puts Jasper off making a quick buck \u2013 he just gets out his steamroller (plus troll cronies) and tries to flatten her farm. Once she\u2019s stopped that, all Ingrid has to do is infiltrate Quickbuck\u2019s manor as a maid and come back with enough evidence to put rabbit-features away for good. Personally, I was a bit disappointed with Level 9\u2019s first interactive adventure, Knight Orc - there were loads of different characters and locations but in the end most of them turned out to be irrelevant. Gnome Ranger was a definite improvement on that, and Ingrid\u2019s Back is even better. The interaction really is worth it this time I just hope, for Ingrid\u2019s sake, that I never meet her front...", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Level 9 Computing", "publishers": "Level 9 Computing", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingrid%27s_Back", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzYg_cnHLw4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/71426-ingrids-back\n"}
