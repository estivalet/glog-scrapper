{"altername_name": ["By Fair Means or Foul"], "name": "Pro Boxing Simulator", "overview": "On ST and Amiga features a full range of jabs, uppercuts and weaves. All fights take place to realistic WBA rules, as you aim to rise the rankings and fight for the title. The crowd frequently shout encouragement and insults, which are displayed using speech bubbles. The 8-bit game is a little different, featuring illegal moves such as kicks and groin punches. There is a referee, so you'll have to wait for him to look away before using those moves. Fights last 15 rounds, and a knockout ends that round, not the entire fight.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Optimus Software", "publishers": "Codemasters Software", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/By_Fair_Means_or_Foul", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1XEa4Idsfk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109690-pro-boxing-simulator\n"}
