{"altername_name": ["Heimdall 2: Into the Hall of Worlds", "Heimdall 2: Into the Hall of Worlds"], "name": "Heimdall 2", "overview": "Anyone lucky enough to go up against Loki, the God of mischief, and come out in one piece deserves a wreath and a heavy handshake. Anyone who then goes up against that God again however, deserves to have his arms and legs removed etc, etc. Well, Heimdall is just such a chap. Not happy with his success a few years ago, he has once again entered the isometric arena in search of thrills. Heimdall 2 have improved features and presentation than Heimdall, offering a number of quests within quests, and an improved control system. Most tasks are based upon the age-old format of delivering the correct object to the correct character. Heimdall 2 has some smashing graphics to keep you felling perky, not to mention just the right amount of arcade and puzzle extras, making it an exciting and absorbing game to play. Arcade action comes in the form of numerous baddies just begging to be run through with a large pointy stick, or better still, shot from a distance with your trusty bow and arrow. There are also plenty of objects to collect and exchange, while conversating with numerous non-hostile characters who give you handy hints on which object to pick up next. Heimdall was on his own in the original game, but Core have taken pity on him in this version and he is now accompanied by a Valkyrie called Ursha. Unfortunately Ursha is somewhat lacking in the magic department, but she more makes up for this combat stakes. Heimdall 2 really has to played to be fully appreciated. I could go on forever about it but I won't. Suffice to say there's enough here to keep you going for quite a while. Couple that with stonkingly good presentation and you've got something well worth taking home and introducing to your parents.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "August 1, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "The 8th Day", "publishers": "Core Design", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.71", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heimdall_2", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytzlY0Q8EP4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/9819-heimdall-2\n"}
