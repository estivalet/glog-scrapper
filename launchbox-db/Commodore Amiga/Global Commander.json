{"altername_name": ["The Armageddon Man"], "name": "Global Commander", "overview": "Armageddon Man (Global Commander in North Amerca) casts you as the Supreme Commander of a future barely balanced Earth. The Earth has been split into 16 separate nuclear capable countries, such as the Black African Republic, Japan and European Unite, and it's your job to make sure it doesn't become lifeless. The game is controlled by a point and click interface where you can check messages, deploy satellites and troops, send food to the regions which need it, and spy on nations. You will regularly get messages that a country is deploying forces or increasing its diplomatic presence in another nation, and can show support or criticism for these. Be aware that these decisions have consequences - the 16 nations all have feelings of importance and would not want to be sidelined.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Martech Games", "publishers": "Datasoft", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.71", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Commander", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0lmfXAWe5o", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73173-global-commander\n"}
