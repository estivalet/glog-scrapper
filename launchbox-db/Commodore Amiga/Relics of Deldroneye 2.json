{"altername_name": ["Relics of Deldroneye 2: Island of Debreen"], "name": "Relics of Deldroneye 2", "overview": "Island of Debreen is a sci-fi/fantasy point & click adventure game, part of the Relics of Deldroneye saga. The main character Falcon, once-loyal to Deldronis royalty but now living alone in exile, has at least acquired his own full-size spacecraft to get around in. As the game begins, Falcon's ship is dangerously low on power and drifting through space, after barely escaping from an altercation with an unidentified hostile vessel. Falcon must carefully conserve remaining power between the ship's various sub-systems, and work out what to do next... The interface splits the screen vertically: the current scene is shown in third-person perspective, above a panel which displays Falcon's current inventory items, and also a number of action buttons: \"Move\", \"Look\", \"Take\", \"Use\", \"Talk\", \"Help\", \"Open\", \"Close\", \"Give\" and \"Show\".", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Digital Ninja", "publishers": "F1 Licenceware", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW3n_-JBsQk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161573-relics-of-deldroneye-2\n"}
