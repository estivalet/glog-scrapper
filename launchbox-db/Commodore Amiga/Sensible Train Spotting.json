{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sensible Train Spotting", "overview": "Sensible Train Spotting is the world's first ever computerized train spotting simulator. The game takes place at a railway station, with a view looking over the train platforms. Various trains pass through, each bearing a unique ID number. At the bottom of the screen is a checklist of train ID numbers, each of which must be selected by the player as the corresponding train appears. This must be done against a time limit, and attempting to record an incorrect number will result in a penalty. When all trains in the checklist have been spotted, the game moves on to the next level.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Sensible Software", "publishers": "Sensible Software", "genres": "Life Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensible_Train_Spotting", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nG2mzYMRNI&t=16s", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/157399-sensible-train-spotting\n"}
