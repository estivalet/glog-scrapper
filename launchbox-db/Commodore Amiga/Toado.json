{"altername_name": [], "name": "Toado", "overview": "Released in 1993 as a PD demo where you could send in for the full game. It is a Frogger clonefor one player with a time limit per level to make things more interesting. Toado is a variant of Konami's classic arcade game Frogger. Although there is a few differences, Toado plays mostly the same as the original. The objective is simple: guide your frogs from the bottom of the screen to their home at the top. To do so you must pass in order, a road, a railway track, a lawn and a river full of floating logs. You have five frogs, and when all of them has reached safety, you will advance to the next level. In later levels the game will become tougher and not just because of the increased speed. You will come across new dangers to watch out for, such as a locomotive, a lawn mover and a tractor. A difference from the original Frogger is that there is a barrier in the middle of the road, making it a bit harder.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jim Wills", "publishers": "Self-Published", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Es7QK3FEhC8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161972-toado\n"}
