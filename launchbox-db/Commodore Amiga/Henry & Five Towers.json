{"altername_name": ["Henry and Five Towers"], "name": "Henry & Five Towers", "overview": "A ROM hack of the original \"Henry in Panic\" game with a major increase of difficulty and some other nice or horrific surprises, depending on your perspective. Avoid a fall, do not touch enemies. Collect all out of 220 items in the game. Once you have died 20 times, the game will end. When underwater you will see Henry's number reduce, if it gets to zero you just drowned Henry! Each tower has a number of items and difficulty, some like Tower 1, the Ice Tower feature \"Ultra Hell\" difficulty. Remember, ice can be broken if you land in it and icicles are not your friend! You must get past the ruler of this tower, he guards the teleporter. Precision jumping is required. Each Tower will have a similar set up, though one or two aren't as difficult. If you can't get past the original Henry in Panic game, don't even try...that is unless you want to get taken down a peg or two.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2015", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "nittamituaki", "publishers": "", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qox_yEKehcY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/163919-henry-five-towers\n"}
