{"altername_name": [], "name": "Thesius XII", "overview": "A horizontally scrolling shoot 'em up created by Kevin Picone fo Underware Design. Thesius XII is a challenging, high action, space fantasy shoot'em up. Thesius XII is similar in design to IREM's classic 'R-TYPE' tm, Although we consider it more a blend between that and my personal favourite, 'Silk Worm' tm. Thesius was re-released to feature three levels to battle through, each level is set within it's own unique scenario, containing various sound tracks and two major guardians per level. Throughout your battle, you'll encounter over 120 unique and highly aggressive alien objects, all of which, have one small idea on their very small minds, Destroy You.... (which is something they're very good at.. ;)", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Underware Design", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn4KJRDH1Gg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161216-thesius-xii\n"}
