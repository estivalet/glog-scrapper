The game plan is based on the '93 World Cup. There are twelve teams to choose from, which are divided into two groups. In the groups everyone plays against everyone, the first four teams in the table after the end of the group stage advance to the quarter-finals. In contrast to other computer implementations of the sport, you always play exactly the same player, even if another player from your own team has the puck. Karamalz Cup is the very first advertising game that was developed by the advertising agency The Art Department in 1993 for the private brewery Henninger Br\u00e4u AG for the Karamalz brand.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Art Department Werbeagentur GmbH", "publishers": "Privatbrauerei Henninger", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/156227-karamalz-cup\n"}
