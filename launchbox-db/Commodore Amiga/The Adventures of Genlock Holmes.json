{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Adventures of Genlock Holmes", "overview": "This program presents a variety of deductive reasoning puzzle stories that encourage students to think logically, read carefully, and comprehend material read. Through critical reading and the process of elimination, strategies for problem solving are developed. If you can complete logic problems correctly, a letter of a randomly selected password will be revealed. Problems consist of a reading passage presenting a problem for Genlock Holmes to solve and one or more logic grids to fill in. You may look back to the story passage while solving the logic grids. Reading passages are intriguing, and will fascinate even the reluctant reader. There are 20 story exercises in all. Students must consider implications, make inferences, and draw conclusions. Information must be \"processed\", not merely recalled.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "MicroEd", "publishers": "", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I30_lr5SSyM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/168059-the-adventures-of-genlock-holmes\n"}
