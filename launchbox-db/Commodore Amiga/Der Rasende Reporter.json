{"altername_name": [], "name": "Der Rasende Reporter", "overview": "Created and produced by the German Press and Information Office of the Federal Government, 1994. THAT FURIOUS REPORTER... or the reporter on the go! Six days on duty for the local newspaper, research on site. What does Lord Mayor Elect Me say about the demonstration on the market square? How does employment office director Bl\u00fcmel find out about black sheep? BAf\u00f6G - how much and for whom? Professor Klugschreiber or Sandra Semester know more. Riots in the football stadium - what is the government doing? What does Europe offer young people? The member of parliament Georg Grenzlos is available to answer questions - so that the newspaper page \"stands\" in the evening. What is written and how it is written determines whether the newspaper circulation goes down or up. In six days there is a chance to achieve a record circulation. By the way: Every newspaper page can of course also be printed out.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Silver Style", "publishers": "Bundespresseamt", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/169430-der-rasende-reporter\n"}
