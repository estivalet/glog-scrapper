{"altername_name": [], "name": "Peg It", "overview": "Peg-it was created by Paul Burkey and released in 1994. It's a peg solitaire style puzzle game. PegIt is in many ways inspired by the board game Peg Solitaire. Each level in the game represents a board. You start each level with a number of PegIts. The objective is to remove all but one PegIt from the board. This is done by moving one PegIt over another which is removed. The amount of moves (or jumps as they are called) is limited so you will fail if you make any unnecessary jumps. The PegIts can jump in four direction and must jump over one space. The can't land on top of each others. To make the game a little bit more difficult, some boards features different objects. Some of these are: Blockers, which can't be jumped over, Trampolines, which allows you to make more than one jump at a time, Teleports and Bombs.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "March 1, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Paul Burkey", "publishers": "", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vty4CwohRo8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162787-peg-it\n"}
