{"altername_name": ["Outlaw"], "name": "Wanted", "overview": "Wanted is a vertically scrolling shooter with a Western theme, similar to Gunsmoke. The player takes the role of a bounty hunter who has to bring four desperadoes to justice. They can be tackled in any order and if all are defeated, a fifth level emerges. The gameplay offers no surprises: shooting masses of enemies until reaching the end of the level. The player can shoot barrels to receive extras, e.g. boots for extra speed or a rifle for a better range. Dynamite destroys every enemy on the screen.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Decroix - Garafalo", "publishers": "Infogrames Europe SA", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/119444-wanted\n"}
