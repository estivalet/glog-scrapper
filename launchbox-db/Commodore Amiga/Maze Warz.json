{"altername_name": [], "name": "Maze Warz", "overview": "A multiplayer game loosely based on an ancient networkable game from the1970's. From one to eight players move droids around a maze armed with a single missile shooter and their wits. This is a game with no beginning and no end. It is a continuous battle for supremacy. This game supports linking two or more computers to play if desired. From one to 4 on each computer. The computer can also control unused droids, with an adjustable reaction time. Two mazes are selected and played simultaneously and changes can happen to the maze on the fly. There are 16 mazes to choose from and a converter is included to allow you to design your own. Each player has a Haven in which special abilities can be purchased with cash gained from shooting other players. No shooting happens in Haven.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Silicon Systems", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "8", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RPJ0M5B17k", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164234-maze-warz\n"}
