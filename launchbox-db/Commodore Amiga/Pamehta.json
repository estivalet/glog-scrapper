{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pamehta", "overview": "This is a German, shareware puzzle adventure set in Egypt and written with Oberon. There are a lot of mystic riddles which you have to solve. Not for adventure\\riddle beginners. Pamehta is also a first-class graphic adventure. It takes you into the mysterious world of ancient Egypt. Quite unprepared, you suddenly find yourself in the middle of the game and have to gradually figure out what it's about. When it becomes apparent that you are suspected of being the thief of a valuable flute, you have to prove everyone wrong. A journey begins through the country on the Nile, which has many surprises in store. Pamehta has a very comfortable mouse control; the keyboard can be pushed aside straight away. If you click on the \u201cAction\u201d button, the program lists all possible commands at that moment, which in turn can be executed with another click. Like Evil Tower, Pamehta is written entirely in German and offers a lot of reading material. Together with the beautifully drawn pictures for each location, a great adventure atmosphere is created. This adventure doesn't have to hide from its commercial counterparts either. For the shareware fee of around 12 marks, which is almost ridiculous considering the quality, you get a program that will give you many exciting and entertaining hours.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "HandMade Games", "publishers": "Berliner Morgenpost", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/372244-pamehta\n"}
