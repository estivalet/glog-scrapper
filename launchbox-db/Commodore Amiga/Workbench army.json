{"altername_name": ["WBArmy"], "name": "Workbench army", "overview": "WBArmy is a one or two player artillery game for playing in a window on the Workbench, inspired by Scorched Tanks. Two players, or one player and a computer-controlled enemy, control a pair of tanks in a jagged landscape. The goal is to destroy the opposing tank by entering the correct angle and power for the gun, taking into account gravity and wind. The tanks can also move, if they have enough fuel. Hitting the enemy gives cash awards, which can be used to replenish shields and fuel or to buy stronger projectiles. Bonuses are also dropped in the shape of air-drop crates in the landscape. Environmental factors, colors and the computer's intelligence can be customized. The game also has a follow-up in the shape of WinArmy.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Luky soft 2000", "publishers": "LukySoft", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/373808-workbench-army\n"}
