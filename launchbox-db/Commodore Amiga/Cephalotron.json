{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cephalotron", "overview": "A combined Tron-Artillery game. You make track of worms, but with weapons. All 30 players have 5 weapons of their own and automatic shields and 3 speeds during the game. You can make Lava Storms, Airstrikes and trillions of other weapons. Cephalo Tron is built based on the game Stratoplex: 3D Tron. This is how the creator Pete W. Stronsky himself presents the game. Many of you were probably surprised by the description of the \"Tron-Artillery game\". I'll explain right away, this is a game in which you have your own ray that is still advancing and growing. Your goal is to keep the beam from hitting the walls of the arena or your opponent; when that happens, you're done. You probably think, it's impossible, I can't stand dodging for more than a minute. Don't worry, Pete W. Stronsky solved it brilliantly, because you can use weapons. And it then proceeds with the beam where it is cleared of others. So to those weapons. So each player has five different ones.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Pete W Storonskij", "publishers": "Incineplex Games", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "30", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AbuXXhuFQA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162298-cephalotron\n"}
