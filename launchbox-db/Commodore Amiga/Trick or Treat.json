{"altername_name": [], "name": "Trick or Treat", "overview": "So simple but fantastic fun. A shareware, 2-player split screen first-person shooter duel. You get some powerups like teleporters, invisibility, or fireballs by entering into the various doors in the arena. Hilarious death scene. Trick or Treat values gameplay over an advanced engine and is a fun texture mapped arena shooter for two players. Each player is allocated their own mini-view of the maze which allows simultaneous play.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Duncan Stuart", "publishers": "Duncan Stuart", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4wI1C5GH9s", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161894-trick-or-treat\n"}
