{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mr Wobbly Leg Versus the Invaders from Space", "overview": "A variation on a space invaders type game whee you first have to avoid the invaders shots to gather stars until you become a first class pilot and possibly get some extra shots. Then, being an eligible pilot, you begin the actual fight against the invaders. Amiga Power #10 (coverdisk 10), Feb 1992. CU Amiga (coverdisk 41), Sept 1992. This simple SPACE INVADERS clone features a slight variation on the theme where the jelly-legged pilot is able to collect increasingly advanced power-ups as the game progresses, ultimately resulting in the ability to wipe out whole waves of invaders in one fell swoop. Nonetheless, despite its unoriginal paradigm, MR WOBBLY LEG demonstrated enough talent in pure assembler programming that coder Mike Diskett was adjudged the winner of Amiga Power's 'Win A Job At Bullfrog!' competition by Peter Molyneux, and would go on to convert titles such as SYNDICATE and THEME PARK to the Amiga before launching his own now-defunct development team Mucky Foot Productions.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "MC Diskett", "publishers": "CU Amiga", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S8YiGFNH5o", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164314-mr-wobbly-leg-versus-the-invaders-from-space\n"}
