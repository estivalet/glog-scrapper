{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bomb Jack Beer Edition", "overview": "Bomb Jack was released originally as an arcade game way back in 1984 by Tehkan (known today as Tecmo.) Graeme Cowie (Mcgeezer) over on English Amiga Board Forums announced a new Bomb Jack remake for the Amiga. The game was written from scratch in 68K assembly language. Coding by Graeme Cowie. Music and sound FX conversion by Simone Bernacchia. Graphics reused from the Arcade version. Bomb Jack Beer Edition is looking very close to original Arcade graphics with smooth game play from Jack. In the game, your hero is Jack. Jack can perform high jumps and float in the air. His goal is to collect all the red bombs on the screen. The game has enemies such as birds and mummies which, once they drop to the bottom of the screen, morph into things like flying saucers and orbs that float around the screen, if Jack comes into contact with any of these, he will lose a life. Collecting bombs will increase the bonus meter at the top of the screen (collecting lit bombs increases it more). When the meter is completely filled up, a circular bouncing \u201cP\u201d appears, and when collected, it will turn all the enemies into bonus coins for a short period of time in which Jack may collect them.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2018", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Graeme Cowie", "publishers": "", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.88", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/131527-bomb-jack-beer-edition\n"}
