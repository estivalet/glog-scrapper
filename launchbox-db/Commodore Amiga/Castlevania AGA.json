{"altername_name": [], "name": "Castlevania AGA", "overview": "Castlevania AGA was created by Dante 3d dev, who is also behind the Arcade to Amiga conversion of Green Beret, he has released an early prototype of what looks to be an in-development Castlevania AGA which is based around the version released on the SHARP X68000! Castlevania was and still is an incredible action platformer that even today can be played via emulation or through an NES and give you hours worth of enjoyment. Now, however, thanks to Dante 3D dev, you can play not only the prototype which I mentioned above, but it was developed using the Scorpion Engine. The whole first level is playable with its sections (1-1, 1-2 etc) right up to the boss, which can be destroyed and drops an orb. The basic \"framework\" for the game is set such as the main character with a whip and a secondary weapon.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "January 31, 2022", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzYJq3F9ick", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/163517-castlevania-aga\n"}
