{"altername_name": [], "name": "European Championship 1992", "overview": "Conversion of Tecmo's arcade soccer game World Cup 1990, though the computer version has been licensed to the European Championship of 1992. It's a standard isometric view arcade style soccer game - easy, simple, as mediocre as a soccer game can get. You can choose from 25 European teams represented in that tournament, although there's hardly a difference between playing, for example, Greece and Italy. If you like the arcade game, you might find this one a bit nostalgic-- although not necessary fun at all. There are simply far too many better action-oriented soccer games to occupy your time with.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Elite Systems", "publishers": "Elite Systems", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Championship_1992", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90838-european-championship-1992\n"}
