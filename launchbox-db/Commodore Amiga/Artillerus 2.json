{"altername_name": [], "name": "Artillerus 2", "overview": "Artillerus 2 is a multi-player hot-seat artillery game. On a random generated landscape of hills and valleys up to eight players can fight it out as you bomb each other into submission in this turn-based robot artillery battle. At the start of each round, each player purchases their weaponry, and shields for defense. Then it's off to battle! Aim your cannon, paying attention to trajectory and wind. Shots are fired by selecting an angle and a velocity; the terrain is destructible, so craters can chip away at the landscape, or cause a player's robot to drop into the resulting pit causing extra damage. The game offers a large variety of weapons and defenses. A small sample of these include shells, mortars, and bombs, nukes in various sizes, and special weapons that dig into the ground or explode multiple times. Or, if missiles aren't your thing, you can send your foes a personal gift of flaming napalm. There are also dirt bombs which can be used to bury yourself, for safety from opposing attacks.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Michael Boeh", "publishers": "Michael Boeh", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "8", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/145516-artillerus-2\n"}
