{"altername_name": [], "name": "Elite Advanced", "overview": "Elite Advanced is a modified version of the classic space trader game. The changes have been made by AmiGer under the CARE project . Elite puts you in a role of starship commander (a small starship). You can choose to be whatever you want - a trader, mercenary, pirate, all of the above! Trade goods and earn money slowly or seek and destroy other ships. As you earn ranks, you'll be offered some missions to finally reach the ultimate rank - ELITE. Very hard and very entertaining. Modifications are: new ships, Warrior MkIV and Colubrid II. New equipment: Climatech Universal Laser Cooler and M2031A3 Heavy Military Laser. Some visual adjustments are made e.g. planet colours in space now fit to colours in local navigation chart, etc. Equipment is now splitted into two pages if more then 15 equipments are available. Rating point table halved, so you reach the E-L-I-T-E status and the missions earlier.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2003", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "AmiGer", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90711-elite-advanced\n"}
