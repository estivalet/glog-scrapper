{"altername_name": ["Intrigue a la Renaissance"], "name": "Intrigue \u00e0 la Renaissance", "overview": "An educational game about the Renaissance. Here you are between the fourteenth and fifteenth century, in the heart of the Loire Valley. Your mission is to recognize a dangerous thief who, not content with owning a time machine, uses it for dishonest purposes that may even change the course of history. It's up to you to put an end to his misdeeds before he upsets the history books which are already quite complicated enough as it is. You will have to visit seven ch\u00e2teaux spread over five different periods: Blois, Langeais, Chinon, Amboise, Chaumont, Chambord and Chenonceau. In or in front of each castle, someone will ask questions that will allow you to gather a clue about the fleeing thief, if your answers are correct.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Coktel Vision", "publishers": "Coktel Vision", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrigue_%C3%A0_la_Renaissance", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTKPpDUmOSg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/128135-intrigue-a-la-renaissance\n"}
