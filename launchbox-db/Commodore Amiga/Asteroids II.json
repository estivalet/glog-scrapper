{"altername_name": ["Asteriods 2 0"], "name": "Asteroids II", "overview": "Not a typo, this is Asteriods 2! What do you get when you combine Asteroids, Sinistar, Mine Storm, and just about any decent Asteroids derivative into one game? Why, you get Mike Seifert's Asteriods II, of course. Take the original game, throw in power-ups, enemy fighters, motherships, and the classic vector graphics of the arcade original, and you have Asteriods II. The game can be set for different game speeds and the level of play can be boosted or lowered. Asteriods II also features a two player mode - both players can brave the universe as teammates, or they can fight as bitter opponents while also blasting the invading forces.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "March 20, 1993", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mike Seifert", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/160114-asteroids-ii\n"}
