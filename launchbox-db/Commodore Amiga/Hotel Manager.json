{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hotel Manager", "overview": "A game for up to 4 players that is similar to Monopoly, created by Ronnie Simpson in 1992. The object of the tame is to try to gain total control of the board. This is achieved by buying and upgrading the various hotels The computer keeps track of all the bank balances and transactions. Hotels are grouped in pairs and cannot be upgraded unless owned by the same player. The hotels become more expensive as you move clockwise from Go. The ones at the very center are the most expensive. If you bank balance falls into the red, the least expensive will automatically be sold off. If you are playing to a time limit, this is reached and all properties sold off for original values including upgrades to get the final totals. The winner is the one who bankrupts the others or has the most money when the time limit is reached", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ronnie Simpson", "publishers": "AMOS Licenseware", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDuQ_iBm4Cw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/163947-hotel-manager\n"}
