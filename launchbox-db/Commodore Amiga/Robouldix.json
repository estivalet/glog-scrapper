{"altername_name": [], "name": "Robouldix", "overview": "A Boulder-Dash style game written by Svante Berglund and Patrik Grip-Jansson of Terminus Team in 1993. One of the best Boulder Dash clones I have ever seen, but it's so damned brain-taxing that I only got this far. Scored 89% in The One and I can see why! in 2017 the original author re-released the full game as fully public domain with better two player support and 100 levels.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Terminus Team", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUi2BAcnwFY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162094-robouldix\n"}
