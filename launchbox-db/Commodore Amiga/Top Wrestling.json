{"altername_name": [], "name": "Top Wrestling", "overview": "Top Wrestling is a one-on-one wrestling game. The player controls one of 16 selectable wrestlers and must defeat all the others in a tournament, or selected individual opponents in a single match. Selectable wrestlers include spoofs of actual then-WWF wrestlers (such as Hulk Hogan, Sergeant Slaughter, Brutus Beefcake or Shawn Michaels) and other celebrities, as well as original characters. The wrestlers have all the same set of moves: there are no signature moves or distinguishing techniques between them. The moves each wrestler can perform include a standard punch, knee strike, dropkick and throw. Diving drops can also be performed from a turnbuckle when the opponent is down. Competitive multiplayer is available in single match mode. The game can be saved to disk during a tournament.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Holodream Software", "publishers": "Genias", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjWQ1nj4GVQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/127457-top-wrestling\n"}
