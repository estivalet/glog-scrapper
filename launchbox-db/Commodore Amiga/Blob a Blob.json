{"altername_name": [], "name": "Blob a Blob", "overview": "Blob-A-Blob by AmigaLive in 1990, you play as a Green Blob, and your task is to colour up all the Tiles on each platform while avoiding the nasties that lurk around. Your only method of avoiding the Nasties is a Jump Up method, so timing is definitely key here, as jumping too early or late, will cause your life to be drained, as there is no on screen counter for this sadly, You kinda have to guess at your remaining life left. There are switches to press, which can reveal other tiles to change colour of, or indeed teleports (which look like a flat-V shape on each platform) will teleport you to another platform. There is some in-game Music what plays, if you are dead or not started the game, sound effects will play instead and enemies will just randomly move around until you Play. While this Game works in Kickstart 2+ as the Sludge Creatures will cover up the Tiles making them hard to see, so it is included in the KS1.3 Collection.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "K.A.R.", "publishers": "Amiga Live", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvTVZp7sgh8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/163684-blob-a-blob\n"}
