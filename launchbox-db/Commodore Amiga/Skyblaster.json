{"altername_name": [], "name": "Skyblaster", "overview": "Skyblaster is a shoot-em-up, in which the player flies a helicopter over a 3D landscape. The goal is to destroy enemy helicopter, tanks and planes. A strategic element applies, as the moving enemies not only approach the player's vessel, but also the player's home bases. The player must also defend the own bases while trying to destroy the enemy ones. The own bases can used to restore the own helicopter's health and the bases' health can be restored by destroying enemy bases. Each of the three moving unit types exist in two different variations, which are different in their moving speed. Therefore the player always have to keep an close eye on the radar, on which the different types are displayed in different colors (light colors represent the faster types, dark colors the slower moving types). The player's helicopter has two different weapons to fight: missiles and machine guns. While the first is very good to destroy bases, enemy vessels can be easily hit with the machine gun. Control of the own weapons can be extended when playing with two players or using two joysticks at the same time: in this case, one joystick/player controls the helicopter's movement, while the second controls the weapon direction. The game features 20 levels of difficulty, which the player can choose at the start. Although the playfield is displayed with filled polygons, the world itself is basically 2D, as the player can only rotate around one axes; turning up and down or rotating the horizon is not possible.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Expert Software", "publishers": "DigiTek", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/131494-skyblaster\n"}
