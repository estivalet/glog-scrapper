{"altername_name": [], "name": "Exodus: The Last War", "overview": "The Zelds and the Moroi are at war, and only one can survive. Whichever side you take on, you have 20 different missions to win. Basic gameplay involves building facilities to produce the units required to conquer your opposition. These include tanks, planes and various infantry units with different strengths and weaknesses - most are available to both sides. The more advanced units can only be produced by building factories and research facilities. All of this cost money, which is obtained through mining. There is variety and the game's missions, as some involve attempting to survive in a tough position, others involve escorting a convoy, and there are levels conducted entirely at sea.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Z\u0142oty Skarabeusz", "publishers": "Sland Media", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/168930-exodus-the-last-war\n"}
