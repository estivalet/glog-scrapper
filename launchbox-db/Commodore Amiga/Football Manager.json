{"altername_name": [], "name": "Football Manager", "overview": "Football Manager is the first game in the Football Manager series. The player chooses a team and then must try to earn promotion from the fourth to the first division. The player also competes in the FA Cup. While the team and player names are real, they are not accurately represented so whichever team is selected, the player always starts in the fourth division and their team is randomly populated with players. As the match is played, the screen is updated if a goal is scored. For versions with animated graphics highlights like the Amiga, attempts on goal are shown in isometric 3D at either end of the pitch with a scoreboard showing the current score. The player can not affect the game while it is in progress.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Addictive Games", "publishers": "Addictive Games", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_Manager_(1982_video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNRmdgIknXw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/46059-football-manager\n"}
