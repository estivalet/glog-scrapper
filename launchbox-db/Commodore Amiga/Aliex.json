{"altername_name": [], "name": "Aliex", "overview": "In Aliex, the player takes the role of a space pilot who was shot down over a planet. The good news is that the crash-landing was not instantly deadly. The bad news is that the enemy sends in their whole force to kill the player for good. The game requires a lightgun which is used to shoot the numerous enemies appearing on the screen. There are a few enemy types which need more or less hits to be defeated; some of them unleash powerful attacks when they are not disposed of within a certain time frame. Of course the other enemies are also able to damage the player's life energy and running out causes death. Along with ammo, it can be refilled by shooting packages which drop in after a certain amount of points are earned. The background (first desert, then jungle) automatically scrolls from left to right and than back; the goal is to survive this ordeal often enough.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Software Creations", "publishers": "Trojan software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.86", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/74200-aliex\n"}
