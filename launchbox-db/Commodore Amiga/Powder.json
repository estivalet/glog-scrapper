{"altername_name": [], "name": "Powder", "overview": "This particular little bundle's a sideways scrolling affair, taking you through six levels of the usual shoot em-up adversaries - flying baddies, ground baddies, and end of level baddies - where you simply try to survive for as long as possible. Everything about the game is average. There are a couple of nice graphic effects, but for the most part it looks decidedly home made. Powder has no new ideas and only manages to lift itself slightly from mediocrity by allowing the player to change weapons. Shoot-em ups may be the mainstay of simple, addictive gaming but they really need to be fun and enjoyable. Powder is worth a try if you are fan of the genre.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1998", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Five Stars VG", "publishers": "Verkosoft", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zjis6xSz5E", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72686-powder\n"}
