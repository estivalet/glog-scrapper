{"altername_name": ["Junior Boulderdash"], "name": "Jr-Boulderdash", "overview": "Jr-Boulderdash is a minimalistic Boulder Dash clone. Your goal is to collect all the buried treasures on the screen, without being crushed by a boulder when you dislodge it from the soil. Unlike in many variants of Boulder Dash, once you have collected the final treasure, the level is over immediately -- you do not need to seek an exit as well. There is also no time limit, but you do have a limited number of lives. The game has no music and very simple sound effects.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Klaus Kramer", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CytzZTNg6sM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/372152-jr-boulderdash\n"}
