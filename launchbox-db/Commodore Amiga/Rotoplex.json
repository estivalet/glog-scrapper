{"altername_name": [], "name": "Rotoplex", "overview": "Designed and coded by The Assembly Line and scheduled for release in 1991. The finished game was going to include 40 levels of puzzle-solving fun against the computer, 2 player/demo modes, adjustable difficulty level, save game statistics for each level and level replays. A 3 level timed demo appeared on a dual format (ST/Amiga) coverdisk of The One (Issue 30, Mar 91). At the time the game did not have a publisher, thus the demo was designed to gauge how appealing a cerebral problem-solving game like this would be to potential buyers and publishers alike. Incidentally, neither the Amiga or Atari ST versions were thought to have ever released, but game disks have appeared now and again in the wild, and of course the magazine release did occur.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "The Assembly Line", "publishers": "The One (Coverdisk)", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIUQVyzsEyo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164539-rotoplex\n"}
