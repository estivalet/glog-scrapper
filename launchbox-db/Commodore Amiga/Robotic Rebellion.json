{"altername_name": ["Robot Rebellion"], "name": "Robotic Rebellion", "overview": "Take part as a robot in this platform game from Ben Marty, released as shareware in 1993. Full versions purchased could be had with an editor, if requested. Collect gems to buy items from an elf, collect keys to open doors of the same color, feathers slow your fall for a while. Rounded end blocks make floors until they encounter something. Elves sell keys of their hood color and other fun items. Spikes are deadly and there are secret blocks that must be bumped from below to reveal their treasures.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ben Marty", "publishers": "Ben Marty", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lloqd3rYdt4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164522-robotic-rebellion\n"}
