{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dr. Plummet's House of Flux", "overview": "Dr. Plummet's House of Flux is an Action game, developed and published by MicroIllusions, which was released in Europe in 1989. There are not too many Thrust clones on the Amiga, so American publishers Microillusions reckon it is about time there were more. This one gives the player 28 levels spread over four increasingly difficult missions, where the idea is to fly around the often bizarre and psychedelic levels and rescue a set number of highly animated astronauts by flying into them and you move on to the next level. The levels vary in size and complexity, including extremely thin tunnels, gaps and gravity which have to be negotiated on some of the later levels. Just to complicate things more, there are enemy bases on later levels that fire at the ship whenever it gets too close. Simple ideas are often the best and if you are a fan of precise control and gameplay, with just the right level of frustration, you are going to be wowed by this. It is tremendous fun but all that concentrating can give you a headache after a while. Everyone should have at least one game of this type in their collection. During play, press \u2018HELP\u2019 to activate the cheat mode, and then use any of the following: F1 - Skip levels. F2 - Invincibility. F3 - Restock everything.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hjalmer Peterson", "publishers": "CDS Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Plummet's_House_of_Flux", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWVS2NImQfc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/64965-dr-plummets-house-of-flux\n"}
