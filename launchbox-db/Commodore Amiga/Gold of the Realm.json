{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gold of the Realm", "overview": "A dying man is found on your doorstep. He hands you a map and in his dying breath, tells of a great treasure of gold located in one of four castles built by the Four Princes of the Realm. Although deserted for many years now, the gold still remains, along with only a few evil things and remnants of sorcery that watch over the treasure. With only your work horse as company you leave on your quest. At the start of this game of exploration, you have a choice of difficulty, Easy, Medium, and Hard. Make your way through the castles by picking up items and using them when necessary. Avoid being touched by a spook - they will steal your current item and drop it somewhere in the Realm. Map and save often to succeed on your quest. If you have defeated all obstacles, and have the treasure, go back to your horse, and press the joystick button.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Magnetic Images", "publishers": "Magnetic Images", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/101786-gold-of-the-realm\n"}
