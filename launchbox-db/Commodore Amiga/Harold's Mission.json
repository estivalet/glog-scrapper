As these names may suggest, the action takes place in a fantasy-like interior of a computer, which happens to look - to our surprise - more like a run-down town than a cyberpunk \"information highway\". Misja Harolda: Zaginiony w systemie (Harold's mission: Lost in the system) is a point-and-click adventure game. It features conversations with dialogue options - wrong choices may even lead to your demise. Another thing that makes it \"Sierra-like\" is that it also keeps track of your score.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "ART4 Comp Group", "publishers": "MarkSoft", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72080-harolds-mission\n"}
