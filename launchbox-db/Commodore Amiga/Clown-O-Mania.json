{"altername_name": [], "name": "Clown-O-Mania", "overview": "In Clown-O-Mania the player takes the role of the clown Beppo who leaves his old profession behind in search of the land of magic crystals. To reach it, he needs to solve 82 isometric levels by collecting all balls and diamonds spread out over the tiles. The levels also have different planes which are changed by either using a ladder or jumping. However, jumps and shots for his gun need to be picked up first - which is made more difficult by the fact that the symbols move over the level. Over the course of the game the difficulty and complexity rises at a steady rate, e.g. at first there are no enemies, later the enemies walk on pre-defined ways and even further down the path they actively try to hunt down Beppo. It also introduces more and more gameplay elements along the way, e.g. one-way tiles, teleports, funnels, speed-up tiles or death tiles. Some tiles change their colour when walking over them, and having them all in the same colour when finishing the level gives major bonus points. Also, useful are two different pyramids which stop or kill enemies when dropped in their way.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Roman Rossart", "publishers": "Starbyte Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.9", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HF4U6Yn35AE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/71900-clown-o-mania\n"}
