{"altername_name": [], "name": "Prime Mover", "overview": "Prime Mover is a motorcycle racing action game, viewed from behind the bike. There are twelve riders and five bikes (with different top speeds, acceleration and handling) to choose from. The full championship includes 12 races against a field of seven riders (computer opponents are loosely named after real riders of the day \u2013 Rain Wayney and Lucie Kavanora for example). Circuits are set around the world, with various weather effects, with a rendition of each national anthem played on the pre-race screen. Handling is loose and arcadey. It is not possible to fall off \u2013 contact with hazards or other bikes simply results in you losing time.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Interactivision", "publishers": "Psygnosis", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKpGWhSZQFs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/44111-prime-mover\n"}
