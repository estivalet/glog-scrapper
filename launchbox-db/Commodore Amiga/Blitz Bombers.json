{"altername_name": [], "name": "Blitz Bombers", "overview": "Er, there's not much to say really. Get some mates round. Plug in a couple of joysticks and start the game. You must each press fire when the game gives you the choice of players in order to activate your player. Then you'll find yourself in the middle of a cute-looking garden. All you've got to do is bomb your way through to an opponent and blow the hell out of them. To place a bomb, press fire and then run away. The bombs have a timer of a few seconds before they blow. Be careful so that you don't stay in the path of the explosion, because you'll blow yourself up. To avoid this, hide round corners. When some of the blocks are blown up, you'll find that they reveal power-ups. Needles to say, grab them. There are other weapons too and the game can be fully configured from the options screen. That's it really, you'll pick the rest up as you go along.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Leading Edge", "publishers": "Amiga Format", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75054-blitz-bombers\n"}
