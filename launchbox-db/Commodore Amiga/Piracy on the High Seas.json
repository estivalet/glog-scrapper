{"altername_name": [], "name": "Piracy on the High Seas", "overview": "In Piracy on the High Seas the player takes the role of three men who have to recover the Golden Chalice of Balance to restore piece to the world (Nordic scenario with a few fantasy elements like magic). However, they require information where to go and these are only available to rich people. So the majority of the game is spent with getting enough money by free-roaming the sea and setting up a trading organization. The game also offers a variety of mini games, often started after a random encounter with a pirate ship: one-on-one sabre fights, sea fights against pirates and gambling. The main storyline, after receiving the next bit of information, results in an isometric dungeon crawl with action-based combat.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "ArtGame", "publishers": "I.C.E.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/127403-piracy-on-the-high-seas\n"}
