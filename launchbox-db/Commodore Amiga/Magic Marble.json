{"altername_name": [], "name": "Magic Marble", "overview": "In Magic Marble, the player takes the role of Marvin who has to find a new Grytzl for the marble community. But unfortunately the only way to get one is to travel through ten dangerous levels in the forbidden lands of Wrabis. In principle the player just needs to guide the marble from left and right, but of course there are various obstacles to make life harder. For starters, the way mostly consists only of a tight gangway of tiles with endless space around it. Also there are switch puzzles to solve and tiles with different properties to consider, e.g. disappearing ones, ramps or ice tiles which are obviously problematic for a rolling protagonist. On the way there are dollar symbols to collect which can be reinvested in shops (which can be reached by rolling over the associated tile). Here the player can purchase helpful extras like extra time to expand the time limit, a level skip or legs. Sometimes extras can also collected directly on the way without the need to spend money.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sphinx Software", "publishers": "Sphinx Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/101942-magic-marble\n"}
