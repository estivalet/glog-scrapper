{"altername_name": [], "name": "German Dice", "overview": "The object of the game is to score 10,000 points by throwing the dice. After each throw you must choose to save a least one die. This increases your Temp Score. If you have no legal throw then this is a Wipeout and the next player gets their turn. If you manage to save all the dices then you have Blitz and can trow all the dice again. After each save you will be asked if you want to Twist or Stick. If you Stick your Temp Score is added to your Total Score but if you Wipeout then you lose the Temp Score.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1997", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Rabsoft", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KJVijZpVrg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/163853-german-dice\n"}
