{"altername_name": ["G-Rocker 0.97"], "name": "G-Rocker", "overview": "A two player gravity combat game by Sami-Pekka Haavisto aka Queer of Clones. G-Rocker 0.97 is beta version of TurboRaketti-style two player combat game, where players control little vessels trying to wipe the opponent out. Though the game is beta version, it is fully playable and has (almost) all features final version should have had. Only thing missing are original music, more and better graphics, more scene types and couple of new weapons. The game may seem a pretty one-to-one copy of TurboRaketti, but I can assure you it is quite different. The main thing is playability, and I think this is the best game in it's genre that works with old A500 (with 1MB memory). There may never be final version, since nowadays I code for PC, but if I get nasty bug reports, I may fix the game a little. By the way, I'm currently working on PC-version of G-Rocker, and it will appear to funet as soon as it gets somewhere.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sami-Pekka Haavisto", "publishers": "Homebrew Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165093-g-rocker\n"}
