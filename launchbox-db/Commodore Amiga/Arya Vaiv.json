{"altername_name": [], "name": "Arya Vaiv", "overview": "Another representative of numerous group called 'space shooters'. With classic cosmic ship under your command you have two usual objectives to fulfill - destroy everything and try to survive. There are 4 similar levels further split into two parts. Second part is always harder because the end of it is occupied by huge/powerful boss. You start the mission with a few lives in stock and two problems: the ship is too slow and equipped with basic single fire only. Try to shoot to bits special transport so you'll be awarded with \"Speed Up\" (to accelerate movement of your ship) or \"Power Up\" (to increase power of one and only weapon in this game). Other collectible items are \"500\", \"1000\", \"5000\" points and finally \"1 Up\" (one life). There is no time to rest during the mission because you're constantly threatened by hundreds of enemies and different obstacles. Get ready for flying types like bombs, orbs, various ships and ground types like shooting turret, laser gates and many more.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Megadream Software", "publishers": "Dongleware Verlags", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/74639-arya-vaiv\n"}
