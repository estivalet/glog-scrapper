{"altername_name": [], "name": "T-Racer", "overview": "T-Racer is a 2D side-scrolling shoot 'em up with a side view. Written for Amiga line of computers entirely in Assembly 68000. Technically it offered the best that existed at the time: multi-layer parallax scrolling, hundreds of on-screen color, dozens of BOB (Blitter Objects, or sprite, for non-Amigans), scroll extremely fluid. Call me old-fashioned, but I'm in it for the effects--explosions are good, and the last blue 'rippley-looking level' really hit the eye-cones. Music's good. Overall: difficult, somewhat interesting.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Virtual Dreams", "publishers": "Virtual Dreams", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGfh6NHxURY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73681-t-racer\n"}
