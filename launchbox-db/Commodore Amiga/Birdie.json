{"altername_name": [], "name": "Birdie", "overview": "A Carvus style, platform game, the full version has 30 levels, the demo has only 3. Birdie woke up one day to find all his pals on the beach had been turned into grey, sad blocks. Your mission is to run over the blocks and bring their color back. The baddies must be avoided and bubbles can be burst for extra points. Keep your eyes open for extra lives which may float amongst the bubbles. The screen wraps around vertically so use this to your advantage. Passwords for the current level are shown on the score bar.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Fraser Hay", "publishers": "Fraser Hay", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAxiZw6B7JA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165372-birdie\n"}
