{"altername_name": [], "name": "Discovery", "overview": "Discovery is a variant of classic Thrust game, which is in turn based on Gravitar, ATARI's arcade classic. Your goal is to maneuver your spaceship through treacherous caves, fighting both gravity and the evil defense systems to collect stray astronauts. After you locate all astronauts, you must make your way to your starting point. All the while, you must keep track of your energy, and watch out for the rocks. Like the Thrust, Discovery is easy to learn, but hard to master. The game is also quite difficult, but good physics and smooth gameplay will keep you hooked in the same way that Asteroids and Gravitar kept you hooked years ago.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "An Upfront Production", "publishers": "Amiga Fun", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/89979-discovery\n"}
