{"altername_name": [], "name": "Kids Type", "overview": "Using large characters, bright colours and easy to use controls, Kidstype is the ideal starting point for youngsters to both gain confidence in using computers and to create their own stories. Kidstype lets your youngsters add \"letter associated\" pictures into stories. They can be encouraged to type about the pictures and, if you want it to, Kidstype will speak what has been typed. Kidstype has a spelling game-youngsters can learn to recognise pictures and spell the words associated with the pictures. Based on ideas from teachers, Kidstype is designed to be fun to use and to bring out the creativity in children (and in mums and dads!!)", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Helios Software Design", "publishers": "Genisoft", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/368534-kids-type\n"}
