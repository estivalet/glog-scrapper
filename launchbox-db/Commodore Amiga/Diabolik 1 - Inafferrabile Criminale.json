{"altername_name": ["Diabolik 01: Inafferrabile Criminale"], "name": "Diabolik 1: Inafferrabile Criminale", "overview": "This is \"Elusive criminal\", the first episode of the series dedicated to the adventures of the thief-gentleman created by the Giussani sisters. The game is a platformer with adventure elements. The engine is that of the game \"Dylan Dog - The killers\", which was released in stores before Simulmondo started with the newsstand series. Much of the graphics are quite good for the time and price-point, but the engine itself could be really slow.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Simulmondo", "publishers": "Simulmondo", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jbtDfT66O0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/128122-diabolik-1-inafferrabile-criminale\n"}
