{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tower FRA", "overview": "Tower FRA is certainly different to the type of programs that Thalion are recognised for. Usually you can expect to see a below average arcade game, but Tower FRA is a totally different kettle of fish. Although the game doesn't look like too much has gone into it, it plays amazingly well. Although the graphics don't matter, they could still have been a lot better, and the supposedly sampled sound seems as if it's come straight off the Workbench voice utility. This game is not going to appeal to everyone, but for those of you who enjoy this type of thing Tower FRA is brilliant.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Atlantis", "publishers": "Thalion", "genres": "Flight Simulator", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73675-tower-fra\n"}
