{"altername_name": [], "name": "Marble Slide", "overview": "The whole screen is a giant slider (Fifteen) puzzle, but this one is 11x10. You must QUICKLY slide things around to allow you to move the ball from the starting position to the end piece. The ball will happily stay for a short while in the starting position, so get some places joined together to allow it to move before letting it out of the first section. Game is very challenging and came with a level editor.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Peter Handel", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MUqWy2l-JE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164215-marble-slide\n"}
