{"altername_name": [], "name": "Minden", "overview": "This card game derived from \"Patience\" is played with three card sets (96 cards in total). The upper and left edge is for the 12 aces, on which you have to stack cards in sequence of their numbers, which must exactly match in suit, too. If all cards have correctly been stacked on the aces, i. e. all the uppermost cards show a King, the game is won. The row of eight cards on the bottom edge is meant for interim placement of cards, i. e. if you are unable to find a matching card for any of the 12 decks. Here you have to lay the cards in the opposite sequence (King - 7), in which suits must be inverse, too. (e. g. if you have a King of Hearts, you can only lay a Queen of Clubs or a Queen of Spades. Trivia: The quotation shown on the end screen is an excerpt of the episode \"Die Geschichte vom fliegenden Robert\" (The Story of Flying Robert) from the 1845 children's book \"Der Struwwelpeter\" (Slovenly Peter) by Heinrich Hoffmann (1809-1894).", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Zentac", "publishers": "", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164262-minden\n"}
