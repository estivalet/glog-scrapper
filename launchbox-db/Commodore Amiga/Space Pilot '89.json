{"altername_name": [], "name": "Space Pilot '89", "overview": "Space Pilot '89 is a remake of Space Pilot and a variant of Time Pilot. The background story involves a pilot who gets mixed up in a time trap and visits different time zones. There he has to shoot a certain amount of enemies to get access to the next level which increases the difficulty. Enemies either try to ram the player or shoot rockets. New in comparison to the original Space Pilot is the power up system: shot enemies may leave symbols behind which grant advantages when picked up, e.g. a shield, automatic fire (both for a limited amount of time) or another weapon. The symbol changes if it is shot. The game scrolls in multiple directions and all few levels there is a boss to defeat.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Kingsoft", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpOaqeLk5Iw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/105005-space-pilot-89\n"}
