SkillGrid is an endless score-attack vertical shoot 'em up for AGA Amigas developed by Retream, featuring frenetic, tactical gameplay and consisting of a variety of different sub-games, boss battles and in-depth scoring mechanics. Based on an original concept, SkillGrid faces the player against infinite waves of enemies to kill, bonuses and upgrades to collect (cyan cells) and maluses to avoid (yellow cells). Designed for AGA Amigas only, the game features three-layer parallax variable-speed scrolling (2 of which generated procedurally), 8-bit alpha channel transparencies and real-time palette changes, highscore saving, beautifully designed sprites with pixel-perfect collision detection, high quality prog-rock music in the form of lossless-packed 8 bit stereo 28.9 kHz samples and even in-game speech warnings (from the developer himself)! All of this is crammed into a single load game that runs from floppy, CD or hard disk!", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "April 26, 2019", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Retream 2019", "publishers": "RGCD", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLLtD4nr5ck", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/130518-skill-grid\n"}
