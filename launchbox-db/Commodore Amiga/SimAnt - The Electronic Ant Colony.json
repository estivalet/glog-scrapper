{"altername_name": ["SimAnt"], "name": "SimAnt: The Electronic Ant Colony", "overview": "If you've ever suffered through an ant infestation problem or been besieged by the little critters on a family picnic, then SimAnt will probably strike a nerve. SimAnt at heart is a simple game and doesn't have all the glittery action of adventure and action games but it is, after all, a simulation. What it does have is a great deal of integrity, intrigue and interaction and provides literally hours of immersive game play. The interface, as in most Maxis games, is intuitive and very easy to use. Graphics are what you might expect from an ant simulation, fairly simple in appearance but detailed enough to allow meaningful text, charts and graphs to enhance control. Sound effects are very well done and, in fact, can be toggled off if you don't like the sounds of ant carnage before breakfast. SimAnt has an amazing amount of strategy involved in managing the survival skills. With a great interface and easy game control system, it's a breeze to play. Various modes offer depth of game play. Replay value depends on how much effort you want to put into managing a virtual ant colony.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Maxis Software", "publishers": "Ocean Software", "genres": "Life Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimAnt", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9MoppkH8EI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73050-simant-the-electronic-ant-colony\n"}
