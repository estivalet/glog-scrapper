{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bload Runner", "overview": "A Load Runner clone, \"BloadRunner\" has 20 levels, and in the \"instructions\" file on the disk it said \"This game is NOT shareware. I will send a version out with more screens to anyone who sends me a small gift\", so sounds like there could be one with more levels. Version 1.7, which had 38 level files on the disk. Level 35 is not complete so it lacks a spawn point for the player etc. Level 38 (last level) was just a short and easy maze. The game has no ending. The game appears to be a conversion from an Apple game. Like in the original, the evil empire has stolen a huge cache of gold from its rightful owners, and your mission is to infiltrate its treasury and recapture it. This entails progressing through up to 38 screens of platforms, ladders and ropes. The Empire has sent robotic guards down to protect the gold, and contact with any of these will cost you a life. Your method of escaping them is to press fire to dig a hole in their line of movement, thus causing them to fall in briefly, allowing you to move across the gap safely. Once all the gold has been collected, a ladder allowing you to move onto the next screen is added. Completing these screens often requires forward planning and precision.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Chris Price", "publishers": "", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrXzjvCWVtA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/163596-bload-runner\n"}
