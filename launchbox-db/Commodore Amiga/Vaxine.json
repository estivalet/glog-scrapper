{"altername_name": [], "name": "Vaxine", "overview": "In this first person driver/shooter, the player must protect a body's base cells from attack by evil infecting cells. The field of battle is a toroidal grid on which your tri-colored half-sphere base cells sit awaiting your protection. The invading cells (also tri-colored spheres) attempt to bond together into groups and destroy your bases. You destroy the infecting cells by lobbing antibodies (also tri-colored spheres) at them. Hit an infector with the right color shot and it is destroyed. The catch is that you have a limited amount of each color of ammunition. Run out of a color and the game is over. The situation is also complicated by Spitters, enemies that appear and spew out new attacking cells if you take too long to complete a level.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "The Assembly Line", "publishers": "U.S. Gold", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaxine", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/119353-vaxine\n"}
