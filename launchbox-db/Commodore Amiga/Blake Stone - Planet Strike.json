{"altername_name": [], "name": "Blake Stone: Planet Strike", "overview": "An open source conversion of the old DOS game to the Amiga in 2017. To exit the level, the player must ollect a bomb on every map and bring it to a security cube; the bomb will destroy the cube allowing the player to use the exit. It features 24 new levels, played in a single episode in a linear fashion (despite a between level map trying to convince you otherwise), a new weapon, the Plasma Discharger (which functions as the game's ultimate weapon), and several new bad guys and bosses. Though the \"new bad guys\" comment is a little misleading as only one of them is actually all new; the others are the boss aliens from Aliens of Gold (with their stats reduced to non-boss level) or simply slightly edited and re-coloured bad guys from the previous game.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2017", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "JAM Productions", "publishers": "", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/368433-blake-stone-planet-strike\n"}
