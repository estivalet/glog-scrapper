{"altername_name": [], "name": "Roadtrip", "overview": "Race with your red car trying to beat the clock while you avoid the other cars and many obstacles on the road. Collect wrenches and money bags for extra score and drive very fast to beat all 20 stages! EASY is slower and time limits are less tight. The game was designed with \"HARD\" being the \"normal\" difficulty. Wrenches are worth 10000 points but they raise value for each one collected, up to 20k points. Miss one and it resets to 10k. Money bags are worth 25k. When you get a checkpoint you get bonus points for the time left, later levels give more points for each second left. Game save high scores on floppy (leave it write-enabled!) and high scores for HARD and EASY level are kept separated.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2017", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Raliza Software", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRmvcpobNas", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/372239-roadtrip\n"}
