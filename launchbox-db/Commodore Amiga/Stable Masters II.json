The player must first purchase a horse (each of which performs differently in racing). Then the player must choose a jockey that can ride and work with the horse. Finally the player must pick a race course. The player's choices affect the outcome of the race. If the player's horse wins, then the player earns money needed to fund the hiring fees and stable expenses.
