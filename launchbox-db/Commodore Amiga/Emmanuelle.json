{"altername_name": [], "name": "Emmanuelle", "overview": "This adventure is licensed from an autobiography of the rather sordid life of Maryat Rollet-Andriane. It centres around a man's efforts to attract her - suffice to say, he doesn't do so by offering her a can of Pepsi, and the game is not aimed at the young or prudish. Most of the game involves using multiple-choice dialogue to produce the correct outcome. You will visit bars, beaches, and many glamorous cities. There are also several sub-games, as you visit a casino, fend off love rivals, and face down smugglers.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Coktel Vision", "publishers": "Tomahawk", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.39", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/23966-emmanuelle\n"}
