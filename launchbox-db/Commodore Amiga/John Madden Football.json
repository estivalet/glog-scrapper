{"altername_name": ["John Madden American Football"], "name": "John Madden Football", "overview": "Unlike the first computer versions, this game originated on consoles and focuses on the action on the field instead of detailed strategy. There is still a detailed range of moves available, all grouped for quick selection. Game play modes include regular season, playoffs and sudden death. The game features 16 regular teams plus one All-Madden team, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Play actions include selecting a pass recipient as a play unfolds, block tackles, dives and sackings. Different weather conditions come into play when it's wet, snowy or muddy.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "May 1, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Electronic Arts", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Madden_Football_(1990_video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/81528-john-madden-football\n"}
