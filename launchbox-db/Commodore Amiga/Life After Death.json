{"altername_name": [], "name": "Life After Death", "overview": "A shareware text adventure game created by James Lean with AMOS and released in 1992. In Life After Death you control not one, but two characters, the young students of the supernatural, Orrin and Lena. Subsequently the problems within the game often require two people to solve them. You may freely swap between characters using the SWAP command, and it must be remembered that both have their own levels of strength and ability. You enter the afterlife in the 'Zone of Reality', in which various aspects of the real world are simulated. After the Zone of Reality you must cross the puzzle-bridge to the Zone of Fantasy, where human fantasies are real, and then on to the Gates of Hell and the end of the game. Along the way you will encounter various characters, and will have to solve many puzzles in order to progress.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "James Lean", "publishers": "James Lean", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/372215-life-after-death\n"}
