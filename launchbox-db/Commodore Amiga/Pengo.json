You're a penguin in a maze made out of ice blocks \u2013 you kill your enemies by pushing the ice blocks onto them. Game has 64 levels, a 2-player mode, lots of hidden things, lots of bonuses, and a brilliant 'evil boss': the Sarvebuk. Well, sarve is Estonian, and comes from sarv which means horn. Buk doesn't really mean anything. Sarvebuk means, insofar it has a meaning, a buk with horns. It's a word programmer's (Martin Rebas) brother Hannes invented when he was maybe five years old. This game took a year to write, mainly because Martin did his best to make the game really user-friendly and compatible with different Amigas & screen modes. The finished program consists of 23000 lines of assembly code.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "MartinSoft", "publishers": "MartinSoft", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM09vQESgTU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72662-pengo\n"}
