{"altername_name": [], "name": "Evil Insects", "overview": "An indirect fire rethinking of the Space Invaders formula. In this your pistol-packing protagonist squares of against a small, but ever increasing amount of formation-flying bugs. Shooting the roof over the bugs causes chips to fall down that will kill the bugs, you can also hit them directly, but it is a tough shot as your bullet is much smaller than the roof chips that fall. The evil insectoids will also be dropping who knows what deadly shots at you, avoid those and stop the Evil Insects!", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Matthijs Hollemans", "publishers": "fantasy freaks", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRe3cymc4Tk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/163824-evil-insects\n"}
