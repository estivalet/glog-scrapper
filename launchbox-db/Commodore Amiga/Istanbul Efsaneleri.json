The game consists of a lot of different different spells (actually swear words from turkish) and a very different character system. The story takes place in an alternative Istanbul. You start with a group of four Turkish youngsters who were playing football near an abandoned auto-park. When the ball accidentally went inside the building and of course the youngsters after the ball, they all find themselves in a medieval looking Istanbul. They use all of their training (swearing as spells, waste baskets as shields, and turnips as weapons) to overcome the dangers of this mysterious and evil-infested medieval looking Istanbul, and return to their homes. The gameplay is from the first-person perspective. You control your party with the keyboard and find your way in the 2D environment. The combats are from an isometric point of view and turn-based.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Silicon Worx", "publishers": "Silicon Worx", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5Q9GEI8LcE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161790-istanbul-efsaneleri\n"}
