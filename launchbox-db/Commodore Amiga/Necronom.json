{"altername_name": [], "name": "Necronom", "overview": "A side-viewed horizontally-scrolling space shoot 'em up. There are a wide variety of targets to hit or avoid, some stationary, some with programmed attack paths and others with artificial intelligence to close in on you. The graphics have a very metallic look, similar to Cybernoid in a way. There aren't many power-ups on offer, and you aren't too dependent on them to be able to survive. However, an auto-fire joystick is strongly recommended.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Lunatic Software", "publishers": "Linel", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.1", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/Xd8YyraU8Vk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/71954-necronom\n"}
