{"altername_name": [], "name": "Feudal Lords", "overview": "Feudal Lords is a turn-based strategy game set in the medieval kingdom Euthrania. Four lords, either controlled by human players or AI, fight for control over the kingdom. This is also the winning condition: getting all provinces into the own sphere of influence. Of course the lords also have a fair amount of management to think about, e.g. building up an army with different soldiers types, ensuring the kingdom's stability by taxing and trading and diplomacy to get the other lords off the back for a time. There are two options to overtake the kingdom: open war (sending an army to another province and the computer calculates the result) and behind-the-scenes plotting to start an uprising or order the assassination of the hostile lord. The game is completely menu based.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Plato", "publishers": "Impressions Games", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1unUuTjYbM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/66449-feudal-lords\n"}
