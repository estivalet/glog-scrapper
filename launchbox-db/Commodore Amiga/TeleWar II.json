{"altername_name": [], "name": "TeleWar II", "overview": "TeleWar II is the sequel to the original TeleWar, a two-player strategy game intended to be played via modem, alternatively taking turns at a single computer. Two armies (the blue one and the red one) confront each other on a scrolling battle field, controlled entirely by mouse. The basic game is the same as the predecessor, but with new terrains and scenarios and updates to the engine. The game is finished once the enemy army is destroyed, if a player cedes the game, or if the flag is captured. A follow-up, TeleWar III was announced but never published, but the game was further refined into Operation Com\u2022Bat, which for the first time added artificial intelligence, making one-player games possible as well.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Software Terminal", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/167306-telewar-ii\n"}
