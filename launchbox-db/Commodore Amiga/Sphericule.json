{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sphericule", "overview": "A game much like E-Motion. You use the mechanics of Asteroids, rotate and thrust to push similarly colored balls together in order to remove them. When the do come together an egg for a new ball is dropped, as you match balls to remove them, they generate pods. If you don't get the pod it will turn into a full-sized ball again that will need to be removed.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "The Assembly Line", "publishers": "U.S. Gold", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/368335-sphericule\n"}
