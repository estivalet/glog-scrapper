{"altername_name": [], "name": "Super Sport Challenge", "overview": "One of the last multi-event sports simulations, ten events are brought to life here, including sprints, hurdles, swimming, and field events. None of the events feature joystick-waggling - the only consistant comparison is the 1500m event from Daley Thompson's Decathlon. Your athlete starts with a limited amount of energy, which must be used as appropriate. Moving the joystick left or right releases it, while the fire button activates a 'turbo' mode of sorts - a quick burst of extreme energy which must be used wisely. A variety of perspectives are used for the events, including one of the first uses of isometric graphics in a sport game.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Microids", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/131512-super-sport-challenge\n"}
