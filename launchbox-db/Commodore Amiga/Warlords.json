{"altername_name": [], "name": "Warlords", "overview": "The first in the Warlords series. Basically, your mission is world domination. This may be played between up to 8 people all on the same machine. It is a medieval type strategy game that requires the player to control 80 cities in the realm of Illuria. In order to do so you must wipe out your 7 opponents. Gold is accrued through the ownership of cities. The gold is then used to create armies. Heroes can sometimes \"find\" things or be rewarded by sages (there are only 2 and it's a first come first served basis). You can choose between various human and non-human peoples, as well as the ubiquitous evil Warlord. This is a very early version of what strategy games eventually became.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "January 1, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "SSG", "publishers": "SSG", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "8", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warlords_(1990_video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/104951-warlords\n"}
