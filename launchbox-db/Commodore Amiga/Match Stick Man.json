{"altername_name": [], "name": "Match Stick Man", "overview": "Guide the little guy to the switch whilst avoiding different objects coming for you. A shareware AMOS game from Stuart Fisher. You star as Matchstick Man, and your aim is to collect the match at the far right of the screen, while the First Level is really easy, the levels get more complex over time, with several enemies who want to thwart your Matchstick Collection Plans. The enemies can be a match which hurtles towards you, which you must jump over, and it does turn around off-screen and proceed back towards you, so you must be pretty quick to avoid it. There are Cigarettes which move up and down, which you walk under to avoid them, and you can get Henchmen who are in the ground, but raise something into the air to stop you proceeding. Even much later you get Green Blobs which follow you around, which are slow, but certainly cause some concern when added onto levels with other objects to jump over and/or avoid.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Stuart Fisher", "publishers": "Stuart Fisher", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8kPv22nPqw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/372181-match-stick-man\n"}
