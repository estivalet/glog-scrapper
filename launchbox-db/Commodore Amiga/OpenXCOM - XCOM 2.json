X-COM: Terror from the Deep brings the alien terror into a totally new dimension. X-COM: Terror from the Deep is the follow-up to the resource management and tactical combat game X-COM: Enemy Unknown. This OpenXCom recompilation was planned for Vampire but due to very inefficient loading code it took long minutes for this game to load. This is not a problem for Pistorm with Emu68 so I\u2019ve decided to release it only for this accelerator.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2023", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "", "developers": "ArtiGames", "publishers": "", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/371190-openxcom-xcom-2\n"}
