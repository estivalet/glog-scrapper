{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pipeline (R. Brown)", "overview": "The aim is to bring water at the end of the pipeline. The water slowly fills the pipeline. The major issue is that enemies (tools and mice) can create holes in the pipepline. To fix holes, you have to reach one of the blue collar men (touch him). He will then follow you. Bring him to the hole and he will fix it. You will need to protect him from the enemies because otherwise he will be killed and you have to bring him again (as he will re-appear). You can have the two men with you instead of just one. Once the water has reached the end, you need to bring a blue collar men to the end of the pipeline (there is a sort of valve and I think he opens it). Then you and the two men will take a victory posture and go the the next level. Unlike most pipeline style games this one is setup up more as a platformer than an puzzle\\action game.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "R.
