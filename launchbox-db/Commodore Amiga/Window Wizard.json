{"altername_name": [], "name": "Window Wizard", "overview": "In Window Wizard the player takes the role of Willy, the window cleaner. Willy has a big job: cleaning the windows of a house with multiple floors. The goal of each level is to clean every window while avoiding death. Cleaning a window takes a few seconds. But he can only work on windows which are closed and the residents like to look out of the window - in this case Willy uses a horn to chase them away. He also needs to look out for and dodge objects or people which fall out of higher windows. A bird likes to use cleaned windows as toilet and a special cleaner has to be used to deal with this. But it needs to be used with caution because it destroys regular windows.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "reLINE Software", "publishers": "Reline Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/104806-window-wizard\n"}
