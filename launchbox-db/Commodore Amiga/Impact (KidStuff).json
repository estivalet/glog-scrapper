Carr ) and released via Licenseware in 1994. When you strike a competitor you will hear the children exclaim, \"Impact!\"", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "KidStuff", "publishers": "F1 Licenceware", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "3", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FHdhnLlxHQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164038-impact-kidstuff\n"}
