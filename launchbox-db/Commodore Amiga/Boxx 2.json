{"altername_name": [], "name": "Boxx 2", "overview": "Boxx 2 is an Amiga title developed by Lemming880 of EAB that features more than it's fair share of fun. A run and jump platform game developed in Backbone where your goal is to collect all the coins and kill the baddies. Boxx 2 features worthy enough detail, bright colours and cool game play which would usually be found from indie developers on such sites as Gamejolt. A fun game indeed and one that works well enough even on the Amiga 500, but Amiga 1200 or higher is recommended.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "January 9, 2015", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "", "developers": "Lemming880", "publishers": "Aminet", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75189-boxx-2\n"}
