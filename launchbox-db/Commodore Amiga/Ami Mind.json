{"altername_name": ["AmigaMind"], "name": "Ami Mind", "overview": "Ami Mind is a take on classic code-breaking game MasterMind. The computer sets the pattern and the player tries to guess the pattern, in both order and color, within ten turns. Each guess is made by placing a row of code pegs on the decoding board. Once placed, the computer provides feedback by placing from zero to four key pegs in the small holes of the row with the guess. A green key peg is placed for each code peg from the guess which is correct in both color and position. A white key peg indicates the existence of a correct color code peg placed in the wrong position.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Intersoft", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/159455-ami-mind\n"}
