{"altername_name": ["Darryl's Super Chicken Run"], "name": "Super Chicken Run", "overview": "Created by Conan Mcphee of Katzma in the spring of 1996 as a public domain game, this is a Freeway\\Frogger variant action game. As Darryl, you have to prove to your pea-brained peers that you're no chicken. How? By being unreasonably stupid - by running back and forth on the M-11 to core maximum points! Use the joystick to get from one side to the other as many times as possible and grab bonus points by picking up the Golden Katzma statues. See if you can discover Darryl's secret move. If you can, try to work out how to save the almost certainly doomed hedgehog....good luck!", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Katzma Software", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwgZGfGx20A", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164670-super-chicken-run\n"}
