{"altername_name": [], "name": "Quest for Glory II: Trial by Fire", "overview": "The sequel to the first Quest for Glory game takes place in the town Shapeir and the desert surrounding it, in a Middle East-like environment. It seems that the powerful elemental spirits have been troubling the Shapeir folk recently. Something, or someone, is behind those troubles. It is your task to find out what is going on, to get acquainted with the many inhabitants of Shapeir and to prove once more you are worthy of your heroic title! Just like its predecessor, 'Trial by Fire' is an adventure game with text-based interface, puzzles to solve, and characters to talk to, mixed with a role-playing character development system and battles. You can play as either a fighter, a thief, or a wizard, and also become a paladin in this game. The combat is action-based. You gain better parameters by fighting enemies, training, and performing other actions.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sierra On-Line", "publishers": "Sierra On-Line", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quest_for_Glory_II:_Trial_by_Fire", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72831-quest-for-glory-ii-trial-by-fire\n"}
