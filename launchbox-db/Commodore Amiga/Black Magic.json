{"altername_name": [], "name": "Black Magic", "overview": "The year is 1402, the place is the kingdom of Urus, a quiet and prosperous land. Or rather it was until the day the wicked sorcerer Tenus thundered in with his minions to plunder the kingdom's wealth, which he hid in 70 locations. The only hope of counter attacking is Venzius, Urus' most famous sorcerer. Each level is split into the upper and underworlds, with two ways to complete each level. The first is to collect all the diamonds spread across the playing area, depositing them in baskets scattered around. Or you could try your hand at destroying the variety of minions inhabiting the above ground platforms and subterranean caves. When a weapon is picked up an energy bar in the status panel appears, as the current weapon is fired this bar diminishes, though collecting the strawberries scattered around replenishes this. When either one, or both tasks are completed on each screen the sorcerer turns green, informing you that the exit should now be found. A pleasant tune plays throughout Black Magic, and although graphically the game isn't any great shakes, it's pretty playable. As with most games governed by a timer a touch of the old angst sets in, but take a look you might like it.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "EAS Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75038-black-magic\n"}
