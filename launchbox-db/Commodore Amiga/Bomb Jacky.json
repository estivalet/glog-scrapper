{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bomb Jacky", "overview": "Another Bomb Jack clone. The problem with this version is the short time you have on all levels. Some of them can't even be completed without picking up bonus items (time bonus, speedup or a key). The bonus items are randomly dropped. So you really need to have luck to get them. Very lame level design. Wonder if the author took his time to play test the levels before release. 60 levels in this one? Well, there is actually only 20. Level 21-40 and 41-60 has the same level design as level 1-20. They are just slightly harder. You must play all 60 levels to play the last one (level 61).", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Unique Dimension", "publishers": "Unique Dimension", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IB39fYN8a3I", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161512-bomb-jacky\n"}
