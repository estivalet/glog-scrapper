{"altername_name": [], "name": "Fantasy Manager: The Computer Game", "overview": "In Fantasy Manager you create your own football team either alone or with up to 15 other human players. The game is based on a British TV show that was broadcast at the time of its release. You start the game \u00a325 millions on the bank, but you have no players in your squad so you must buy these. They are all real Premier League players that cost between less than a million up to 5 millions. When you have a complete team you just play match after match and you can earn more money that can be used to buy new players. The matches show highlight sequences where you get to know what happened, e.g. goal, corner or foul.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Playtime Software", "publishers": "Anco Software Ltd.", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "15", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/128131-fantasy-manager-the-computer-game\n"}
