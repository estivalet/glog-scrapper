The game is split across 7 multi-directional levels, taking in forests and caves in a fantasy setting. You are armed with a sword and a special energy-bolt attack, which can be charged up. Some vanquished enemies discard food or gold; there are shops in which to spend this.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "July 1, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Core Design", "publishers": "Core Design", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.38", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonstone_(video_game)", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkF4o8Odr0o", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/9806-dragonstone\n"}
