{"altername_name": ["Genghis Khan: Conquests Of Love And War"], "name": "Genghis Khan", "overview": "Genghis Khan is really two games in one. In the solitaire Mode, 'Mongol Conquest' you can become Temujin, the Bordighin tribesman who is destined to unite the Mongols as Genghis Khan. The game then switches to the 'World Conquest' mode which can be played by up to four players. Other notable characters include Richard I (England), Alexious III (Byzantine Empire) and Minamoto Yoritomo (Japan). The two Game Modes show a map divided up into areas/countries which you will need to take. You can make treaties, send spies into countries, attempt assassinations, 'rendezvous' with princesses in an effort to gain children, train your troops, vary taxes, play politics with your governors and so on. During battle you have the opportunity to lead your forces (infantry, cavalry and archers). The game zooms into an excellent hex-based wargame which plays like any of the better wargames on the market. Although Genghis Khan may lack the graphical overkill of say Powermonger, it's undoubtedly an excellent product which kept me up till late hours more times than I care to mention. The challenge of the game is high as the opponents are no fools. They love to attack when you are at your weakest, opponent tactics are intelligent too.
