{"altername_name": ["Colums V2.0"], "name": "Colums", "overview": "The aim in this color matching puzzle game is to get as many points as possible without letting the balls get too high. Whenever there are three or more balls of the same color in a row, those balls disappear. The point count is as follows the number of balls squared. So 3 balls away is 9 points, 5 balls we is 25 points. But beware, there are different shades of color that must be matched. And different shapes only match with themselves.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Arnold Spruijt", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBaVaEFOmGg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/163748-colums\n"}
