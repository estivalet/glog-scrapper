{"altername_name": [], "name": "Stellar Crusade", "overview": "Norm Koger's first game published by SSI was severely marred by a weak manual which, through SSI's \u201cliberal\u201d editing, deleted eleven pages of necessary information and made the game very difficult to play. Even with the documentation, this game of religious jihad on an intergalactic scale is tedious and fraught with imbalance gameplay. Still, it was a commendable effort, and the game's interstellar economic model was very complex for its time. Recommended, but be sure to grab the unreleased version of the manual at Norm Koger's homepage.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Strategic Simulations", "publishers": "Strategic Simulations", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73251-stellar-crusade\n"}
