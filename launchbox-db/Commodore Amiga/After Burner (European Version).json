{"altername_name": ["After Burner II (Activision)"], "name": "After Burner (European Version)", "overview": "After Burner is an aircraft shooter. The goal is simple: use your F-14 Tomcat and shoot as many enemies as you can. This aircraft has two weapons: lock-on missiles and Vulcan cannons (basically machine guns). In some versions there is an option to let the cannons shoot automatically all the time. The game is viewed from behind the plane with you fighting wave after wave of enemy fighters. But at heart it offers the usual shooter mechanics, meaning you spend most of your time dodging and shooting. Sometimes you come across a friendly supply plane and if you dock with it you can replenish your missiles.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Argonaut Software", "publishers": "Activision", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.71", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/After_Burner", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/23812-after-burner-european-version\n"}
