{"altername_name": ["BOH Advance"], "name": "BOH", "overview": "A world of claustrophobic, mysterious, puzzle-riddled, dangerous mazes where, surrounded by countless enemies, you hunt the Evil Masters down with the purpose of eliminating them and the pain they brought. Determination, concentration and quick reflexes will be your only allies in your desperate mission. BOH is a retro-styled top-down shooter/dungeon crawler, influenced by many of the all-time classics of the two genres. You need to solve puzzles, collect items, open passages, avoid traps, kill the Evil Masters and their minions and ultimately come out of the mazes in one piece. After ten years and 18 free updates, a new edition called \"BOH Advance\" was released. It was not a remake but simply the base game bundled with all the updates released so far.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "April 3, 2019", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Retream", "publishers": "Editel", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/373072-boh\n"}
