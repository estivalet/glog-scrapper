{"altername_name": [], "name": "Scuba Diver", "overview": "Unofficial remake of the 1983 Durell Spectrum release Scuba Dive where you take on the role of a fearless pearl diver, as you plunge into the unknown ocean depths! You'll be swimming with sharks, squid, jellyfish and all manner of strange and deadly creatures. When you find a clam, wait for its shell to open, then swoop down and grab your prize! Descend further, to find larger clams with bigger pearls. And if you go deeper still, you may find cave systems with ancient treasures to be taken. That is, if your oxygen holds out and you can get past the waving tentacles of the octopuses which guard these forbidden places! Once you've taken as much as you can find, you'll have to make it back to the surface. Climb aboard your boat, offload your booty, then strap on a fresh oxygen tank and take to the waters once more.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Surreal Software", "publishers": "", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPU9DjxUMw4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/155465-scuba-diver\n"}
