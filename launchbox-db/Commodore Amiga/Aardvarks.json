{"altername_name": [], "name": "Aardvarks", "overview": "Aardvarks is a Lemmings clone that also pays tribute to the TV series The Raccoons and Doctor Who. As in Lemmings, the goal in each level is to guide a number of small creatures that fall onto the level from a mid-air entrypoint (in this case, a UFO) over to the exit point. To do this you will need to assign some of the creatures skills (exploding, blocking, building, horizontal digging and vertical digging) that allow them to alter the terrain, bypass obstacles and avoid danger. Otherwise, the creatures will walk continuously forward until they either fall off an edge, or hit a wall and start walking back the other way.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "", "developers": "Galaxya Software", "publishers": "", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/159096-aardvarks\n"}
