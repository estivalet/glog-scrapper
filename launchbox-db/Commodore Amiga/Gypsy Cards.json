{"altername_name": ["Briscas Espa\u00f1olas"], "name": "Gypsy Cards", "overview": "A one or two player card game using Tarot cards. Each pack of cards has 40 cards, 10 for each suit, the suits are Gold (coins), Cups, Clubs and Spades (swords) and are numbered 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,10,11 and 12 (there are no 8's or 9's). Only 1,3,10, 11 and 12 are worth points (Briscas). 1=11 points, 3=10 points, 10=2 points, 11=3 points and 12=4 points. There are 120 points total available, if each player gets 60 it will be a tie. After dealing one card is dealt face up and this card represents LIFE and the rest of the un-dealt cards are face down next to LIFE. At each turn, a card is played and the other player tries to KILL that card. The one that kills keeps the pair. Players keep 3 cards in their hand, drawing to keep that level. LIFE kills all cards except another LIFE of a higher value. 3 of LIFE kills a 12 of LIFE, but a 12 of LIFE kills any other suit. You can kill a card with a higher number of the same suit. Modem play was available.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Giovanni Cardona", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3eniJtdRw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/163908-gypsy-cards\n"}
