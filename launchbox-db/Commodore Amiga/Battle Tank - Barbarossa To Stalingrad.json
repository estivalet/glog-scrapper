{"altername_name": [], "name": "Battle Tank: Barbarossa To Stalingrad", "overview": "\"Early on Sunday morning, June 22, the German flood poured across the frontier, in three great parallel surges between the Baltic Sea and the Carpatian Mountains.\" As the commander of a front line regiment, you will be part of that surge, aiming your tanks and infantry for the heart of Russia. Or, backed by your T-34s and massed artillery, you can be part of the rock that tide would eventually wash up against at Stalingrad. BATTLE TANK: BARBAROSSA TO STALINGRAD is a command oriented, viewpoint style study of the first half of the Second World War in the East. Your main maneuver elements are companies and platoons. The full range of TOES of the period are under your command, from recon vehicles to Panzer regiments. 7 pre-built scenarios allow the players to get immediately into the game, but the heart of the simulation is a build- your-own routine that allows you to create scenarios simulating innumerable actions between German and Soviet forces. 2 may play, or the computer will play either side.
