You play an elite soldier dropped behind enemy lines who must take out the enemy forces. You can choose your weapons and ammunition before starting, including a wide range of guns as well as grenades and a trusty pocket-knife. You'll have to avoid land mines and destroy bridges along the way. Defeated enemies release further weapons.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "International Computer Entertainment", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/9812-fire-force\n"}
