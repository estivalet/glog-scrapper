{"altername_name": [], "name": "Rings Of Zon Trilogy", "overview": "A maze game with RPG elements from Micro Fix released in 1990. Important note for playing on emulators: Turn your joystick emulation off, in order not to block the Amiga numpad! Game can solely be controlled with numeric keypad, utilizing all keys from 1-9. To liberate Land Zon from the claws of the sinister Korak and his demon spawn, you fend off enemies charging from all sides while you find keys, refresh your life energy or collect symbols for sword strikes or teleporter jumps. Although these symbols increase your own combat power enormously, they can only be used to a limited extent. Despite everything, you will not reach the next level by killing enemies alone, a little strategic evasion and skillful handling of supplies is also essential.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Micro Fix", "publishers": "George Broussard", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/369544-rings-of-zon-trilogy\n"}
