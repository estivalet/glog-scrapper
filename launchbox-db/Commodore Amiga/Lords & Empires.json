{"altername_name": ["Lords and Empires"], "name": "Lords & Empires", "overview": "Lords & Empires is a strategy game for a fantasy world for 2 to 4 players. The game is divided into summer and winter seasons. In the summer you move your armies and conquer new land. During this process you will most likely do battle with your foes as well as with the local people unwilling to see you confiscating their land. In the winter you rearrange your forces, which means recruiting new soldiers, giving them subsistence and organizing them into armies. You can also build ships and fortresses, do some diplomacy and fulfill mode goals. The game has two modes, which are: - Conquest Mode: you can only win by defeating all other players. - Quest mode: Defeat all other players or gather the three artifacts, complete the quest and vanquish any artifact guardians.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Daniel Janson", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2qqJ_hPoUk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162495-lords-empires\n"}
