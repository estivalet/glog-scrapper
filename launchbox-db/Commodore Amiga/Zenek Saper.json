{"altername_name": [], "name": "Zenek Saper", "overview": "Zenek Saper is an adaptation of classic Minesweeper game for up to two players. The rules remain unchanged. The player needs to find all the mines as quickly as possible. Clicking on a field shows a number indicating how many mines are located in the fields nearest to it. One mistake results in a mine explosion and the end of the game. The game features three difficulty levels with 10, 15 and 20 mines on a 10x10 grid board. In two player mode each player makes a movement alternately. Winning is possible in two ways - through the discovery of the last mine or a deadly mistake made by the opponent.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mosquito", "publishers": "Eureka Soft & Hardware", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165052-zenek-saper\n"}
