{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mover", "overview": "Another by the puzzle-king, Harald M\u00fcller (Mueller). In this one or two player game, released commercially in Germany in 1992, you have a series of magnets, some have the magnet on one side, some the other and some on both sides. You must link them up to match the picture shown at the start of the level. You must move the parts around knowing that parts, once moving in a direction will continue until they hit something or meet a directional arrow that will reroute them. There are death heads to avoid and teleporters to use to make it all very complicated.
