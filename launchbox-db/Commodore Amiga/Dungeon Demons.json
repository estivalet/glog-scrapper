{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dungeon Demons", "overview": "A freeware Czech language text adventure from Pinware in 1995. You see something falling, you try to jump, but you're not fast enough. One of your feet slips and before you can recover, a huge, heavy net falls on top of you. It is so heavy that it will pull you to the ground. You panic and in a few seconds you're completely wrapped up in it. You try to get out, but before you can, you see strangely dressed creatures coming. You are trapped! You can finally see one of them. He's not much taller than you, but his stance and especially his clothes give off something like... You shudder against your wall in fear. He wears a coarsely woven robe with a leather belt, a shirt with handmade wooden buttons, and homemade sandals. His face is grotesque. Ridiculous! You're sure you found yourself in some kind of masquerade. But why did they catch you in the net?
