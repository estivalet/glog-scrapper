{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sky Cabbie", "overview": "Sky Cabbie is a Space Taxi variant. The player takes the role of a taxi driver who has to transport passengers from one part of the 24 one-screen levels to another. The faster the player is, the more points are received - the goal is to get as many as possible within a time limit. The levels itself consist of platforms along with obstacles like narrow passages or an active volcano. However, the main challenge are the controls: similar to Thrust the taxi is effected by gravity and needs attuned control inputs in order to avoid crashing into the environment. There is also only a limited amount of fuel available.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kingsoft", "publishers": "Kingsoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/128236-sky-cabbie\n"}
