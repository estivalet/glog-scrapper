{"altername_name": ["Emerald Mine 4"], "name": "Emerald Mine IV", "overview": "Emerald Mine II came with a level editor which enabled everyone to create their own standalone Emerald Mine games. But at the time of the release of Emerald Mine (I) there was already a level editor by Headcrash available. The Emerald Mine Clubs also created other editors, which were sometimes (or maybe always) improvements of existing level editors by Kingsoft. There were also editors available in which people could draw their own graphics and use these in their games. This is the reason why some of the downloadable games below contain different graphics from the original Emerald Mine. There are several games with the name alternately Emerald Mine IV or Emerald Mine 4 because of this. This version is by No One. The first 40 caves are remixed by The Blockheads, the last 40 caves are the original version.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "No One", "publishers": "Emerald Mine Club Holland", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/163820-emerald-mine-iv\n"}
