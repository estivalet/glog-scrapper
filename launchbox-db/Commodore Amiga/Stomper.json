{"altername_name": [], "name": "Stomper", "overview": "An attractive and fun to play Pac-Man clone...well to say that is unfair. It looks almost nothing like Pac-Man. It has a vibe all its own. However, you do go through a maze picking up dots and fruit, baddies roam the maze and try to get you. You can turn the tables on them... for a time. This one has levers and gates and teleporters and a bunch of other stuff, but in the end it it about getting that last dot off the screen....so Pac-Man with a twist? Pac-Man's other personality?
