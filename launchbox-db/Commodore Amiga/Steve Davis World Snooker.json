{"altername_name": [], "name": "Steve Davis World Snooker", "overview": "Steve Davis World Snooker is an updated 16-bit version of CDS' earlier 8-bit Steve Davis game. It offers not only snooker (with ten or fifteen red balls), but also other cue sports: Pool (UK and USA versions) and Billiards (English and Carom - no pockets). These can all be single player, two player or human versus computer (In the guise of Steve Davis). The program has six different levels of playing skill. The view is fixed overhead, however you can zoom in on the table. Slow motion replays are included. The game also has a practice mode, in which lines indicate what the results of a shot will be, and balls can be moved around to set up trick shots.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Binary Design", "publishers": "Artworx Software Company", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/91952-steve-davis-world-snooker\n"}
