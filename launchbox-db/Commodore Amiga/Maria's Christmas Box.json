{"altername_name": ["Maria's Xmas Box!"], "name": "Maria's Christmas Box", "overview": "In this game, you play Strip poker against Maria Whittaker, an UK model of the 1980s. In gaming she also appeared in the European covers of Palace's Barbarian I & II. As the name suggests, she is first wearing a Santa Claus suit and does not get completely naked like in previous games of this type. The gameplay is very similar to Ancos older game Strip Poker II+. In the game itself you can raise bets and can trade each cloth part for 100 credits if you are running out of cash and your hand is too good to not raise. There are two different difficulty levels, \"Easy\" and \"Hard\". The AI does sometimes bluffing with aggressive bets.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Anco Software", "publishers": "Anco Software Ltd.", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.38", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/128159-marias-christmas-box\n"}
