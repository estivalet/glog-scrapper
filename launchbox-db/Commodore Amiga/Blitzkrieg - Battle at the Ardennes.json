{"altername_name": [], "name": "Blitzkrieg: Battle at the Ardennes", "overview": "A conversion of the board game of the same name, this simulation of Battle of the Bulge had a confusing interface and lengthy game mechanics. Although it's a faithful conversion, the awkward user interface and questionable AI makes it one of the worst wargames from RAW. Definitely a case of fun sacrificed for the sake of realism alone, Blitzkrieg will appeal only to die-hard wargamers who are interested in the subject matter and crave historical accuracy. Even the manual is poorly written. Overall, a disappointing wargame that could have been much more, had the designers focus less on faithfully recreating the complex boardgame and more on playability.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Command Simulations", "publishers": "CDS Software", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75059-blitzkrieg-battle-at-the-ardennes\n"}
