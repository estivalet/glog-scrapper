{"altername_name": [], "name": "Shoot Out 2000", "overview": "This is an improved version of Shoot Out 2 (so2.lha) and was featured in Amiga Format issue 135, where it received a pretty good review and reception. The one player game is fast and furious, though perhaps a bit too easy without a human opponent, which is still available! No matter, it\u2019s still a very definite improvement. Another addition is that you can now enter different sectors; instead of simply playing up and down one side of the screen, your ship can go all the way around the screen by entering the sector gates at the corners of the screen as you press the fire button. This can be a fun way of infuriating your opponent, especially because you can both be in the same sector at the same time, which makes it impossible to shoot or be shot at. There are also new weapon power ups in this version such as plasma and double shot.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2000", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gareth Griffiths", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4JObr8kBXI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162564-shoot-out-2000\n"}
