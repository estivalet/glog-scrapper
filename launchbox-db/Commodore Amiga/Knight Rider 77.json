{"altername_name": [], "name": "Knight Rider 77", "overview": "Racing game inspired by a Russian video 'Ustinova - SON' where there is the game 'speed racer'. With graphics and sounds like in an arcade game from 1977, this game challenges you to race against the clock. You get points for distance traveled and cars overtaken. You take damage if you hit the curb or other cars. The game ends when either the time or the damage counter reach zero. As you drive, the width of the tracks keeps changing. Sometimes you have enough room to overtake cars in front of you. Sometimes the track gets so narrow there is no chance to. When this is the case, you have to slow down to a crawl and bide your time", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2021", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Fabrizio Radica", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ97VH1tygc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162721-knight-rider-77\n"}
