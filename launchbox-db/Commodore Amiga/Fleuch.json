{"altername_name": [], "name": "Fleuch", "overview": "You have to move the small space ship through the scenery without touching the walls. Look for a ball and try to fly in short distance to it, then hit space to pick it up. The level ends, if you climb to the top. If your ball is destroyed (but not the ship) enter ESC to get a new ball. Fleuch is based on the Thrust from the C64.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Karsten Goetze", "publishers": "Karsten Goetze", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/91367-fleuch\n"}
