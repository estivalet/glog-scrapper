It is a remake of the multiple choice text adventure from Atari based on a famous movie or the novel by Eco. The story is said to be based on a true event that happened at the Melk Monastery in Northern Italy. The task is to catch the murderer of the slain monks in the act. As for the game mechanics, this is not a classic text book, but rather an interactive novel, where we always read the text and choose one of the three continuation options based on it.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kamil Blazek", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/373060-jmeno-ruze-the-name-rose\n"}
