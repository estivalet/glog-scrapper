{"altername_name": [], "name": "Aztec Challenge (Cobe)", "overview": "Aztec Challenge by Cobe is based on the original Commodore 64 version, but with much upgraded graphics. Like in the original, the player must reach and explore an Aztec temple while avoiding a variety of dangerous obstacles. Each level is like a whole different game, with different challenges and different types of scrolling and exploration. The game starts with an over-the-shoulder view of the player running a gauntlet of spear-throwing natives towards a pyramid which rises on the horizon. Once this is reached, a vertically-scrolling staircase with falling rocks must be traversed, and then there are rooms to explore and deadly aquatic wildlife to avoid (among other dangers) before the game is through.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Cobe", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/371195-aztec-challenge-cobe\n"}
