{"altername_name": [], "name": "Prototype", "overview": "A cross-hairs military shooter with a Special Forces theme. Prototype is a crosshair shooter in the style of Operation Wolf. The graphics and gameplay are surprisingly decent. Sampled speech is a nice touch. I also like the weather effects and the gore. The shooting sounds could be improved, as could the intermission screens. The first mission is to destroy your enemy's communications tower and progress to the city.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Comatose", "publishers": "F1 Licenceware", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5wa_vQFpH0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161831-prototype\n"}
