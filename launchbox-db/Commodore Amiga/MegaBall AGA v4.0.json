{"altername_name": [], "name": "MegaBall AGA v4.0", "overview": "Megaball v4.0 is an Arkanoid variant with many levels, plus a level designer in the registered version, which inspired the DX-Ball series. It is the Sequel to Megaball v1 and Megaball v2 and Megaball v3. This version has code to more fully support AGA style graphics. The basic gameplay involves using a paddle to hit an arrangement of blocks, with the aim being to remove them all. There is an area above the blocks - getting the ball into this can cause a shot to remove lots of balls quickly. Like any Arkanoid-style game, there are power-ups, which are released by hitting particular blocks, and must be caught using the paddle. They include a bigger paddle, laser guns mounted onto each side of the paddle (making it quicker to remove the blocks) and a level-skip, but watch out for the 'kill player' icon. Not all bricks clear with one hit, and some remain on the screen but in a different colour to show that they've been hit.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mackey Software", "publishers": "Intangible Assets Manufacturing", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/229280-megaball-aga-v40\n"}
