{"altername_name": [], "name": "A-Type", "overview": "Built around a shoot'em'up engine developed in 1994, A-Type was put together using ripped graphics from the famous R-Type for the 32K game compo at the Mekka/Symposium demo party in 1998. Though the game is superficially similar to R-Type, it features a different level layout (only one level to fit into 32 kilobytes) and different play mechanics. While there's plenty of weapon upgrades around and your ship comes with a powerful autofire, the enemies can absorb a lot of shots. The game does not end with a boss battle, instead the level shrinks until you crash into a greeting message!", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "April 3, 1998", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Abyss", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAQjB_QrySo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/160326-a-type\n"}
