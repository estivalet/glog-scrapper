{"altername_name": ["3D Construction Kit II", "3D Construction Kit 2.0"], "name": "Virtual Reality Studio 2.0", "overview": "As you would expect, \"Virtual Reality Studio 2.0\" (VRS2) is \"Virtual Reality Studio\" (VRS) with enhancements. There are double the number of controls and commands available in VRS for added complexity and flexibility. You can now create transparent objects or objects that fade. Rounded objects such as flexicubes and spheres are now possible. There's a sound effects editor so that your virtual creations need no longer be silent and the program now comes with a library of pre-designed 3D \"clipart\" for those of you who are too lazy to design everything from scratch. Like the original VRS, the program comes packaged with a tutorial on VHS video cassette for those who don't like to read manuals and your VR creations can be saved as stand-alone programs that don't need VRS2 to run", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Incentive Software", "publishers": "Domark Software", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/128332-virtual-reality-studio-20\n"}
