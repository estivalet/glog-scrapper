{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tetrix", "overview": "Tetrix is a clone of Tetris for the Amiga. It runs in a set of windows on an 8-colour OS screen or on the standard Workbench screen, and multitasks. The graphics are simple, but it has statistics over each type of block dropped and a preview of the next block. There are 15 difficulty levels \u2014 the higher the difficulty, the more of the screen is filled with blocks when the game starts. When a new game is started, you may choose to use the exact same sequence of blocks as in the previous game, a handy feature for setting up tournaments where every player is given the same chances. Control is via the numeric keypad.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Markus Olinger", "publishers": "Amiga Fun", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "http://hol.abime.net/5121", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109942-tetrix\n"}
