{"altername_name": ["Litti's Hot-Shot!"], "name": "Gary Lineker's Hot-Shot!", "overview": "Gary Lineker's Hot-Shot! (Also known as Litti's Hot-Shot!) is a soccer game in which two teams try to win the match. The adjustable options are the number of players, the time of a half time and the AI level. The game is played in a top-down view and only shows a part of the playfield. The player either controls the athlete in ball possession or, when in defense, the one which is nearest. When shooting, the power of the shot depends on how long the button was pressed and the direction changes with the joystick movement, e.g. moving against the walking direction results in a overhead kick. Gary Lineker's Hot-Shot! is sad.
