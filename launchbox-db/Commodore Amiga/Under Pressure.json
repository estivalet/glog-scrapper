{"altername_name": [], "name": "Under Pressure", "overview": "The pressure is building up and you don't have a minute to lose. Fight your way through many levels of weird and wonderful alien landscapes. It will not be an easy task as you meet the mean and nasty monsters who will do everything in their power to stop you. A \"shell\" will appear either when you destroy objects or when you pass through certain special areas. Collect these shells by walking over them. For every four shells you collect you will advance through a selection of weapons that are illustrated on the lower part of the screen. When you wish to change a particular highlighted weapon pull your joystick down and press the fire button until the highlight disappears. You will then be able to use your selected weapon. Certain weapons will have \"extra firepower\" if the fire button of your joystick is held down. Throughout the game you will be confronted with teleports, bridges and lifts. Experiment with jumping and don't be afraid to blast your way out of trouble.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Eldritch the Cat", "publishers": "Electronic Zoo", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/115481-under-pressure\n"}
