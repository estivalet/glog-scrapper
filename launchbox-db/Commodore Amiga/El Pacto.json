{"altername_name": [], "name": "El Pacto", "overview": "I woke up with a start, having fallen asleep doing some reading in bed. He still couldn't believe what he had heard: Charles, I'm dead! It was just a few words that rang clear and terrifying as thunder. It was a deep and distant voice but of unmistakable origin. It was the voice of Baron Bradewick. Scared I looked at the clock. It was several minutes to 9. I got up quickly, I still had 3 hours to live... Impressive, isn't it? This happens to me because I surround myself with bad companies. I wouldn't be in this mess if I hadn't been so fond of the occult, if I hadn't let myself be carried away by the damn Baron's strong personality and vast knowledge of the occult, if I hadn't simply thought to satisfy the wishes of a dying when I signed that damn pact, that voluntary surrender of my body. In three hours he will come for me, but I am willing to stop him.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Role Team Design", "publishers": "CAAD Stock Exchange", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUGd2b66R3s", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/168699-el-pacto\n"}
