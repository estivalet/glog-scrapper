{"altername_name": [], "name": "Skimmers", "overview": "Skimmers 0.870 is a demo racing game by Gareth Williams of Team Mango with 2 different racing craft and 4 arenas. Set in the year 2030, civilization as we know it has been downtrodden by wars and violent outbursts of cosmic storms. The Earth has been destroyed as a result of man's negligence. The few hundred that have escaped have formed small colonies on whatever they could find floating around in the infinite void of space. On a small red planet dwell four violent gangs of boy racers that want to fight for territory on their small planet. You must step into the shoes of the leader of one of these four gangs and become the ruler of the planet by conquering the other gangs. The planet is represented by a map of 7x7 squares. To take a territory, the gangs race against each other. The race is won not just by who is first, but by who has the most blood points awarded for each lap. Points eared by completing laps and for damaging opponent's Skimmer craft.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1997", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Team Mango", "publishers": "", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pivUGDyvQc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162569-skimmers\n"}
