{"altername_name": ["Mot\u00f6rhead"], "name": "Motorhead", "overview": "You are Lemmy - the leader of the heavy metal band Mot\u00f6rhead. Your fellow band members have been kidnapped by fans of other music genres. Our bass-guitar-wielding hero goes on a Double Dragon-esque journey in this side-scrolling beat 'em up. On each level Lemmy heads right, occasionally stopping to fight a group of enemies who pop up in hopes of beating him up. Throughout 6 levels, each of them representing a different genre, you'll not only beat up the enemies with your trusty instrument, but also use various powers - such as an incinerating belch or a deadly bass guitar solo. You'll need to collect powerups that come out of defeated enemies - some of them will heal you, some will give you the energy necessary to use for your powers. After each level (except for the last one) you play a short minigame.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kaitsu", "publishers": "Virgin Games", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.62", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26hUOALAAFo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/41219-motorhead\n"}
