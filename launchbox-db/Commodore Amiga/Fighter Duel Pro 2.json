There is also an Anti-Aircraft gunner mode, where the player is defending his position from the ground against incoming enemy aircraft.

Sky shading is improving on the old uniform blue color, and the aircraft configuration interface has been updated. More aircraft damage types are added, and view control using a joystick hat switch is supported. Ingame chat can be used in-flight.
