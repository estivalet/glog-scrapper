{"altername_name": [], "name": "Silent Service II", "overview": "Silent Service II is a submarine simulation based in the Pacific theatre. World War II is raging. The US has suffered an attack at Pearl Harbor, and most of its battleships are lost. The few remaining US carriers are fighting a desperate war against the Japanese surface fleets. But the US has a secret weapon: sleek, silent, deadly... you are a Submarine Commander! The action is viewed from within the submarine. Watch out for your speed, direction and depth. This game features 9 types of submarines to choose from, 10 types of torpedoes to fire, 14 Japanese surface ships (9 warships, 5 transport), and the entire Pacific Ocean as your battleground. The seven missions all recreate real US navy engagements. Can you sink the Yamato???", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "MPS Labs", "publishers": "MicroProse Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Service_II", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeFQlSwQT4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/24033-silent-service-ii\n"}
