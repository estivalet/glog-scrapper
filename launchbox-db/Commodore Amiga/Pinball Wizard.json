{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pinball Wizard", "overview": "Pinball Wizard is a German pinball game with one non-scrolling table. As usually, the goal is to use the three paddles to keep the ball as long as possible from falling off the screen. Hitting things on the playfield rewards points for the high score list which is saved on the disk. The table also features some additional extras to discover, e.g. hitting a certain spot when the letters \"AMIGA\" are glowing activates a multi ball. Also included is the option to influence the ball's direction by nudging the screen - but this eventually leads to a tilt.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Kingsoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.31", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109682-pinball-wizard\n"}
