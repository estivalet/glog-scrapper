{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cannon Fodder 2", "overview": "Cannon Fodder 2 is a military-themed action game with strategy and shoot 'em up elements. The player controls a small squad of up to four soldiers. These soldiers are armed with machine guns which kill enemy infantry with a single round. The player's troops are similarly fragile, and while they possess superior fire-power at the game's outset the enemy infantry becomes more powerful as the game progresses. As well as foot soldiers, the antagonists include vehicles and missile-armed turrets. The player must also destroy buildings which spawn enemy soldiers. For these targets, which are invulnerable to machine gun fire, the player must utilise secondary, explosive weaponry: grenades and rockets", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "November 13, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sensible Software", "publishers": "Virgin Interactive Entertainment (Europe)", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.1", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannon_Fodder_2", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqRag50MCek", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/19566-cannon-fodder-2\n"}
