{"altername_name": [], "name": "SmurfHunt", "overview": "Game based on the Belgian comic franchise \"The Smurfs\" (aka \"Les Schtroumpfs\"), which was created in 1958 by cartoonist Peyo (Pierre Culliford). I consider Smurf Hunt to be a bit of a classic. Studio Peyo would not approve of a shooter in which you rampage through Smurf village, leaving bloody corpses and burning buildings behind. Pat Carson has blended Smurfs and S.E.U.C.K and come up with something fantastically memorable. Game was included in a SMC (software of the month club) package.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Pat Carson", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOvJ90_K5yg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/368346-smurfhunt\n"}
