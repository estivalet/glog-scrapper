{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pssst", "overview": "Unofficial conversion and upgrade based on the ZX Spectrum game. Growing the best Thyrgodian Megga Chrisanthodil possible is the sole purpose of Robbie the Robot. When insects invade his garden, he has to stop them ruining his work. He has a canister of insect repellent, a smoke-bomb and a startling streamer, each placed on walls at the side of his garden. Each will stun any particular vermin, but you will need to find out exactly what kills what. As the plant grows, aided by the timely addition of compost bags, leaves will start to shoot outwards. The more leaves there are, the quicker it will grow (a simple incorporation of the concept of photosynthesis being boosted by having more sunlight absorbed), so don't let the bugs near it - those whose programmed movement path takes them towards an existing leaf should be your priority. Once the plant is high enough, it flowers and you move onto another level, where increasingly tough foes are on the prowl.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Surreal", "publishers": "", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0gvKLFmLhE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162088-pssst\n"}
