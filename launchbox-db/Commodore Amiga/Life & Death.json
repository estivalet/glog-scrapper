{"altername_name": ["Life and Death"], "name": "Life & Death", "overview": "Life & Death is a game which casts you as a doctor in a hospital. Your job is to diagnose patients and administer appropriate therapies, or even perform surgery when necessary. To diagnose a patient, you have to press on his or her abdomen, to see which portions of the stomach cause pain. Basing on this knowledge, you can choose a therapy for him (observation, medication or referring to another specialist) or administer a X-Ray or ultrasound scan to get more information about his illness.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "The Software Toolworks", "publishers": "Mindscape International", "genres": "Life Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.58", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_%26_Death", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbuZN3IXk30", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/74046-life-death\n"}
