The setting is an arcology floating on the sea. You are a new citizen in this city and you've got to work in order to make money for food and the rent of your suite while staying healthy through sleeping and eating enough. The common way to earn money is playing mostly action-oriented mini-games or doing smaller quests (or rather tasks), which also are part of the plot of the game.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "ad Games", "publishers": "Softgold Computerspiele", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/128272-vision-the-5-dimension-utopia\n"}
