{"altername_name": ["Perihelion: The Prophecy"], "name": "Perihelion", "overview": "The gameplay is controlled from a set of initial icons, with each character's vital statistics accessible from this screen as well as inventory, combat and travel options. Large distances can be traversed simply by issuing directions and letting the characters follow them. The cities have very detailed buildings, but there is little variety between them. Combat is a regular feature of the game, although its occurance is always planned and controlled.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Morbid Visions", "publishers": "Psygnosis", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.9", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perihelion:_The_Prophecy", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/wDYa-YJbL90", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/71957-perihelion\n"}
