{"altername_name": [], "name": "Burger Man", "overview": "Burger Man is a straight BurgerTime variant. In each of the one-screen levels the player needs to assemble a certain number of burgers. Each burger consists of four parts which lie on the platforms. The player needs to walk over those parts and then they fall down one level - when they meet another of the parts, it also falls down. A burger is done when all four parts are on the lowest level. The platforms are interconnected with ladders which are also the only way to evade the enemies which walk around the levels (the player character can't jump). Touching an enemy results in death.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Cloud Nine Developments", "publishers": "Byte Back", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75223-burger-man\n"}
