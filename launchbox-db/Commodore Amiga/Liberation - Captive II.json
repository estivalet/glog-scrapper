{"altername_name": ["Captive II: Liberation"], "name": "Liberation: Captive II", "overview": "Liberation is the sequel to Captive, where the main character from the original is now a free man. However, your character is drawn into action once again after a political assassination and a corporate cover-up by BioCorp, one of the ruling multinational companies. With aid from your four droids you are able to search the city for victims, those used in the cover-ups, of BioCorp. With each minor victory your intent becomes clearer - to persuade the Emperor in regaining control over the corporate hegemony. Liberation is set in a large futuristic city and is a free-range, open-ended RPG. As in its predecessor, you can buy better weapons, from swords to laser-rifles and enhance your droids with new equipment, e.g. numerous head-slots which plug in and give droids different abilities, ultimately driving you closer to the Emperor.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Byte Engineers", "publishers": "Mindscape", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberation:_Captive_2", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73810-liberation-captive-ii\n"}
