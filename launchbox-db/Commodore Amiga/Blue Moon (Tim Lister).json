{"altername_name": [], "name": "Blue Moon (Tim Lister)", "overview": "A solitaire card game where you group all the cards in sets of 13 cards in ascending sequence by suit from Ace to King. This 52-card solitaire starts with the entire deck shuffled and dealt out in four rows. The aces are then moved to the left end of the layout, making 4 initial free spaces. You may move to a space only the card that matches the left neighbor in suit, and is one greater in rank. Kings are high, so no cards may be placed to their right (they create dead spaces). When no moves can be made, cards still out of sequence are reshuffled and dealt face up after the ends of the partial sequences, leaving a card space after each sequence, so that each row looks like a partial sequence followed by a space, followed by enough cards to make a row of 14.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "July 25, 1991", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tim Lister", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/163689-blue-moon-tim-lister\n"}
