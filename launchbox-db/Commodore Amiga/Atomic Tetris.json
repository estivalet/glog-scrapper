The game is played side by side with both players sharing the keyboard. It is basically plays the same as standard Tetris, blocks fall, lines across the screen must be completed to score points etc. There is, however a twist in that there are power bricks, called Specials within the game, which, when included in a completed line, can cause the opponent problems. There are thirteen Specials in the game and their effects range from clearing the screen, switching the screens over, randomizing the opponents screen to changing all the opponents bricks into small dots making them hard to see.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1997", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Paul Clachlan", "publishers": "", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/163656-atomic-tetris\n"}
