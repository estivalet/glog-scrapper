{"altername_name": ["The Ancestral Trail"], "name": "La Storia Ancestrale", "overview": "Versions for MS-DOS and Amiga were both produced in 1994, however the episodic publication of the Amiga version was cancelled in the wake of Commodore's demise. In 2007, coder Fabrizio Farenga made the entire series freely downloadable on his homepage, effectively marking the first Amiga release of the game. The game follows the story of a young boy named Richard, who is magically transported to a fantasy world. There, a man named Golan recognizes him as the Chosen One who is set to restore balance in the world. Richard's task is to retrieve six lost gems, each held by a guardian at the service of the Evil One, and take them all to the Tree of Life. La Storia Ancestrale is a point-and-click adventure game on fixed screens from a two-dimensional side view. Left-clicking on an object or exit causes Richard to walk there, right-clicking will have him look at the object, whereas left-clicking while holding the right button will perform a default action such as pick up or talk. There is a single \"use\" verb for objects in the inventory, which varies in effect depending on Richard's location. Occasionally, Richard will have to fight monsters in an arcade sequence with a crossbow.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2007", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Holodream Software", "publishers": "Hobby & Work", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/155464-la-storia-ancestrale\n"}
