{"altername_name": [], "name": "Odyssey", "overview": "Odyssey is a platformer with puzzle-solving elements. There are seven big, multi-directional scrolling levels which need to be conquered by finding all hidden crystals. The first three are available right from the start and the others gradually open up as a more crystals are found. A lot of time is spent with jumping over gaps and fighting the uncle's soldier with the sword, but there are many puzzles to solve. Much consists of the standard \"finding an object and bringing it to the right spot\", but the big catch is that the hero can transform into animals, e.g. a lion or a bird. Each animal has their own set of abilities which are needed to solve the obstacles the game throws at the player.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Unconscious Minds", "publishers": "Audiogenic Software Ltd.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.23", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/foXxJzqlw1k", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/71956-odyssey\n"}
