{"altername_name": [], "name": "Epic", "overview": "The sun is about to go supernova and humanity must find a new home. All the population is packed into a huge fleet of ships and they set off for a suitable planet. Unfortunately the route goes straight through the territory of a hostile alien race, the Rexxons. The game is a space shooter but you also get surface missions on different planets. The main emphasis on the game is the graphics which were excellent when the game was released but this meant that the game was very short with just 7 levels. There are loads of cutscenes all with music from Holst's planet suite.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "September 1, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Digital Image Design", "publishers": "Ocean Software", "genres": "Flight Simulator", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.77", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40755-epic\n"}
