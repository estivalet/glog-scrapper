{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cave Maze", "overview": "Cave Maze is a text adventure of the classic \u201ccave crawl\u201d genre, intended especially for a younger audience. It features colorful static image for each location, and a baby dragon character that acts as a companion, occasionally commenting on things or intervening (for example, if the player tries to do something dangerous). Most of the puzzles involve finding the right item that allows passage through a location, such as food to give to a hungry animal that won't let you pass. The game seems to have some amount of randomization, both in where objects are found, and also the layout of the cave itself.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Coombe Valley Software", "publishers": "Coombe Valley Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/88824-cave-maze\n"}
