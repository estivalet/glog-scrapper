{"altername_name": [], "name": "Booly", "overview": "Booly is a puzzle game with a similar concept to Gem\u2019X in some ways. You are presented with a top-down view of an array of inter-connected blocks, which are shown in a variety of colours. The aim is to turn them all to grey, but clicking on them (using the pointer you are in control of) will often cause a pattern of other squares to change to the next colour in the sequence as well. You are doing all this with a time limit for each of the 300 levels. A level designer allows you to create your own sequence of up to 1000 levels.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "The Algorithm Guild", "publishers": "Loriciel", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75366-booly\n"}
