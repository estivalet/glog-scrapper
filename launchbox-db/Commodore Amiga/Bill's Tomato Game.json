{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bill's Tomato Game", "overview": "Bill's Tomato Game is a puzzle game similar to the ones in the Incredible Machine series. Completely mouse-controlled, the game is divided in a series of non-scrolling screens, each one being a puzzle. The main objective is to move an anthropomorphic tomato from the left side of the screen to a conveyor belt on the right side. Several objects hinder progress by squishing, perforating, exploding and destroying the tomatoes. The player has an infinite number of them, but a time constraint is in place: a timer runs in the bottom left of the screen. The tomato movement can be started and stopped by clicking a semaphore on the bottom of the screen (the screen objects move independently, with their own timing). In order to solve the levels, you pick various gadgets at the bottom of the screen and place them according to your strategy. These gadgets are: An electric fan that can boost and alter your tomato's trajectory A trampoline where the tomato can bounce and reach new height A Jack-In-The-Box to eject the tomato upwards A blocking box to stop the tomato's movement", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "December 1, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Psygnosis", "publishers": "Psygnosis", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.57", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill%27s_Tomato_Game", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSsCRbu0SZs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40410-bills-tomato-game\n"}
