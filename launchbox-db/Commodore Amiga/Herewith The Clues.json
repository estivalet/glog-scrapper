{"altername_name": [], "name": "Herewith The Clues", "overview": "Herewith the Clues is a detective game based on the 1939 \"Crime Dossier\" of the same name, originally devised by Dennis Wheatley (1897-1977) and J.G. Links (1904-1997). While the original format devised by Wheatley and Links was a cardboard folder full of physical documents and replica clues such as cigarette ends, movie ticket stubs, locks of hair, newspaper clippings, etc., this video game adaptation uses black and white digitized photographs of the clues and presents them laid out on a desk to be inspected and looked through using a point & click interface. The crime you are trying to solve is the murder of a Russian man named Serge Orloff, who had been living in London and running a club called The Milky Way.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "John Chasey", "publishers": "Actual Screenshots", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/367662-herewith-the-clues\n"}
