{"altername_name": [], "name": "Enterprise", "overview": "Enjoy the experience of orbiting a planet and then flying on the surface. Mankind has spread its roots to many solar systems both far and wide, and has colonized planets far beyond today's beliefs. This is not for the sake of exploration, but to mine for precious minerals and metals. The memory of man's first home has been lost to the sands of time and only myth remains. It is said that the planet that started life as they know it is Sola III, a politically important planet. However, the ozone layer has been fading well beyond your ability to regenerate it. The only chance for the planet is to find 6 rare nuclei to stabilize the ozone layer. You must take to the controls of the Enterprise and scan the galaxy for the needed items. You start in the cockpit of your ship with the controls at your fingertips.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "ARC Software", "publishers": "ARC Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/128129-enterprise\n"}
