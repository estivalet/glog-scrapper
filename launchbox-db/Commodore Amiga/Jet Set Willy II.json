{"altername_name": ["Jet Set Willy II: The Final Frontier"], "name": "Jet Set Willy II", "overview": "Jet Set Willy II: The Final Frontier is a platform game released by Software Projects for a variety of home computers. It was the only official sequel to Jet Set Willy, one of the most successful and popular home computer games ever released. Officially, Jet Set Willy II: The Final Frontier is the last of the Miner Willy series, although numerous unofficial sequels, remakes, homages and updates have been released, even up to this day. Jet Set Willy II is an expansion of the original JSW rather than a new game unto itself. Its map is primarily an expanded version of the original mansion, with only a few new elements over its predecessor, several of which are based on rumoured events in JSW that were in fact never programmed (such as being able to launch the titular ship in the screen called \"The Yacht\" and explore an island). In some versions Willy is blasted from the Rocket Room into space, and for these 33 rooms he dons a spacesuit.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Software Creations", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.83", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_Set_Willy_II", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/80323-jet-set-willy-ii\n"}
