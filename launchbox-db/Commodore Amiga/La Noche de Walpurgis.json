{"altername_name": [], "name": "La Noche de Walpurgis", "overview": "The game is a weird mix of all kinds of genres. The first part is a horizontal shooter/platformer, while the second part is a point-and-click adventure which you need to find a solution to. Knowledge of Spanish language is not needed in the first part, but in the point-and-click adventure part, it is even mandatory, as the great part of hints will be given by speech only.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Javier Maura", "publishers": "New Dream", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/368352-la-noche-de-walpurgis\n"}
