{"altername_name": [], "name": "Lotus Esprit Turbo Challenge", "overview": "The first in a series of 3 racing games endorsed by the legendary car company, which is now a part of Proton. The game features a total of 32 fictitious racetracks from around the world, split into 3 difficulty levels. There are 19 computer opponents (15 on the 8-bit versions) and you have to finish in the top 10 (top 8 on the 8-bits) to progress. The higher you finish in one race, the lower down the grid you start for the next race. The opposition drivers have pun names based on the F1 drivers of the day - examples include Ricardo Pastry and Crashhard Banger. You can choose between sound effects or one of a variety of music pieces. The game features a simultaneous 2-player mode, but the 1-player mode only uses half the screen, a simple animation filling the other half. In most races you will have to make a pitstop for fuel in order to reach the finish. The tracks include features such as oil slicks, roadworks, boulders and rivers - contact with these (or the other cars) will slow you, but there is no car damage model.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Magnetic Fields", "publishers": "Gremlin Graphics Software", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.08", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_(series)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui8xYi0nL-k", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/9179-lotus-esprit-turbo-challenge\n"}
