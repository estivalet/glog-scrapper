{"altername_name": [], "name": "Beast Busters", "overview": "Beast Busters is a rail shooter similar to Operation Wolf. The players take on the role of Johnny Justice or Sammy Stately (Paul Patriot only featured in arcade version) and must shoot their way out of the city. The arcade version had 3 mounted guns, allowing for three player simultaneous action. The home conversions support a maximum of two players. The player must shoot everything that moves, while conserving ammo and grenades. Your machine gun can kill everything if you hit it enough times, and you can use the grenade launcher for really deadly targets or just to clear the screen of zombie scum. Grenades you can pick up along the way include standard grenades, electro grenade and napalm bombs. Onscreen zombies explode in a splatter of blood and gore. The screen scrolls in a variety of directions, sometimes in pseudo 3D. You'll be pummelled by a LOT of enemies. Some will be shooting, throwing Molotov cocktails and knifes and other will simply jump right at you. You can shoot knifes out of the air if you aim well enough. The bosses include a zombie punk who mutates into a dog, a freaky blob-snake-head that comes at the screen and a jeep which comes to life.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Images Design", "publishers": "Activision", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beast_Busters", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTp1tfsRbgc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/9106-beast-busters\n"}
