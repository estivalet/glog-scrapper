{"altername_name": [], "name": "Leisure Suit Larry In the Land of the Lounge Lizards", "overview": "Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards is the first game in Al Lowe's Leisure Suit Larry series, largely inspired by the text adventure Softporn Adventure. Larry, the game's protagonist, is a short, tacky, balding, leisure suit-wearing kinda guy who's constantly searching for his next score. His combination of stupidity and brashness gets Larry into trouble. The object is to get him out of trouble in traditional adventure fashion, finding and manipulating objects as you thread your way through the story line. The content is comedic and adult-oriented. A graphical interface is used with a text parser to input commands. Typical of Sierra games, progress is tracked through a set amount of points, awarded for advancement or minor actions. Hints : Hold down \u2018ALT\u2019 and \u2018X\u2019 keys to get past proof of age. Hold down \u2018ALT\u2019 and \u2018D\u2019. It will ask for a location number. Enter a number form 008-045 (must be a three digit number).", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "July 5, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sierra On-Line", "publishers": "Sierra On-Line", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.55", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leisure_Suit_Larry_in_the_Land_of_the_Lounge_Lizards", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI1EvZOZG3k", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/9176-leisure-suit-larry-in-the-land-of-the-lounge-lizards\n"}
