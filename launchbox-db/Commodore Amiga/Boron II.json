{"altername_name": ["Boron 2"], "name": "Boron II", "overview": "This game starts out looking like a straight-forward horizontally scrolling shooter, but the entire first wave you might as well not shoot your weapon, it is all about avoiding shots fired and oncoming meteors, but from then on becomes a full on shooter. Like the first game in the series you only have one life to give for your hobby. If you get hit you have to start from scratch. Unlike the original, you proceed past the first boss and are greeted by a mix of shooting and avoid-it areas throughout the alien complex to a second boss. If you can take him out, the game is complete. Though you might want to let it play on after completion as the music is pretty funky.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Paul Mangan", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKs1Ae-VmcU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162414-boron-ii\n"}
