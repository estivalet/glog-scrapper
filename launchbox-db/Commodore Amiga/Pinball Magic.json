{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pinball Magic", "overview": "Pinball Magic is for one or two players, working through a sequence of twelve tables. Each one has several letters on screen, usually in more than one place. Runnig the ball over each letter opens the exit; pass through this to reach the next screen. Completing a screen gives both players a new set of the 5 balls they start the game with. Tables look similar to 1950s designs, with 'mushroom' bumpers, points-based targets. A more electronic feel is added by 'black holes' yielding an extra life, a set of bricks to be cleared on one level, and an integrated 'fruit machine' segment on another.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Loriciel", "publishers": "Loriciels", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109680-pinball-magic\n"}
