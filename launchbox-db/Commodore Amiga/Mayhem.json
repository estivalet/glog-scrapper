{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mayhem", "overview": "Mayhem 2 is a multiplayer (2 - 4) flight shooter with a really simple objective - destroy your opponents before they destroy you. It was created by Albatron and Ensigna and released in 1991. Considered a hidden PD gem this game has been ported to the Raspberri PI and Windows platforms. Destroy your opponents by shooting them, you win when all other players have run out of lives. Your ship has limited fuel which will run down when you boost, if you run out you will be unable to control your ship, to refuel, land on any flat surface. You can protect yourself from attack using your shields which will stop all bullets, be careful though your shields run down quickly and you wont be able to boost while your shields are on. Powerups are dropped (sometimes) when a player is destroyed (by either crashing or being shot) and when collected will give you a temporary boost.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Albatron", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vxozz0Ijdr0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165145-mayhem\n"}
