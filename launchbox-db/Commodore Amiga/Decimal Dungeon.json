{"altername_name": [], "name": "Decimal Dungeon", "overview": "Decimal Dungeon is a educational math game for one or two players. Designed to teach students about decimals and fractions, the player must help navigate a man through a haunted dungeon. Numerous stalagmites block the player's path, but if the player correctly answers a math question, the stalagmites will temporarily lower to the ground allowing the player to pass. If the player answers incorrectly, they are dumped through a trap door by a bat. The goal is to reach the top of the levels by continuously answering questions correctly. It contains three levels of difficulty, and a variety of different math problems including converting fractions, decimals, and percentages, as well as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division questions.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Christopher Greve", "publishers": "Unicorn Educational Software", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/131530-decimal-dungeon\n"}
