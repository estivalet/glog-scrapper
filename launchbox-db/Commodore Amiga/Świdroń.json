{"altername_name": ["Swidron"], "name": "\u015awidro\u0144", "overview": "\u015awidro\u0144 is a Boulder Dash variant. As a miner the player must collect the designated number of diamonds in an abandoned mine and reach the exit doors before the time runs out. The task is made difficult by falling rocks and growing magma. The equipment includes cement bags and explosives. Cement surrounds the place where the miner stood, and the bomb will blow up the nearest surrounding fields, therefore you should leave the place very quickly. Rocks may be pushed on the drilled field and will fall on such field if it rise underneath. Walking through already drilled tunnels is much faster. To change magma into diamonds \u015awirdo\u0144 need to block it from each side.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Wikom", "publishers": "Bisoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162105-swidron\n"}
