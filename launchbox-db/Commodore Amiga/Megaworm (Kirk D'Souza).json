{"altername_name": [], "name": "Megaworm (Kirk D'Souza)", "overview": "Megaworm which was written by Kirk D\u2019Souza in Devpac 3, is a take on a classic Worm game, in which you have to pick up dots to progress through the game's 50 levels. The Special Powerups are as follows: Light Green increases you speed for 10 seconds, Dark Green decreases speed, Purple doubles the length of your worm, Pink shortens your worm, Red gives you a new life, Orange gives you more points for moving, Blue turns all the worms Blue, so on a level with lots of barriers, this would make it more difficult for example, Light Blue gives Invunerability for 10 seconds, Yellow reverses the controls of the opposite player (so if computer gets this one, expect lots of fun heh), and Grey switches off the lights, so you can only see a small part of the screen around your snake for 20 seconds!", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kirk D'Souza", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164247-megaworm-kirk-dsouza\n"}
