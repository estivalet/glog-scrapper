{"altername_name": [], "name": "Giddy II: Hero in an Egg Shell", "overview": "While watching television, Giddy learns that an alien spaceship has descended over Cutesville. It starts to send strange waves that modify the behaviour of objects. Suddenly the TV transforms into a jar of pickles. Giddy decides to fight the menace, and return his homeland to normality. But first, he is going to eat the pickles. Giddy 2 is an Amiga freeware clone of Dizzy and its sequels. Intended as parody of that classic series, it also stars an anthropomorphic egg that must collect objects in order to solve puzzles. On the top screen there are three heart-shaped energy bars for the three lives of the character. If the egg touches any of the enemies, this energy bar decreases, and when it is completely drained the egg explodes with an onomatopoeic \"SPLAT!\", and the player loses a life. On the top-right side there is the accumulated number of coins collected by the character. Below both items is a black strip that displays the inventory content when in use mode (pressing the space bar enters the use mode, where the player moves the joystick left or right to cycle through the assembled inventory, and hits fire to use the selected object).", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "", "developers": "Phil Ruston", "publishers": "F1 Licenceware", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.38", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeePLR5KNTw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/68294-giddy-ii-hero-in-an-egg-shell\n"}
