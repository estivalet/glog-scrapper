{"altername_name": [], "name": "Extrial", "overview": "In Extrial your mission is to collect the soldiers that are running around on the platforms by reaching them and crouching down so they can hop into your robotic machine whilst avoiding / shooting the baddies. There are 3 levels to get through, each with it's own boss which obviously you must defeat to be able to progress to the next level. Incredibly hard game but pretty cool too.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Active", "publishers": "CompuTec Verlag", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/91091-extrial\n"}
