{"altername_name": [], "name": "Simulman 6: Luna Park", "overview": "Simulman 06: Luna Park is an Italian 2D single screen - flip screen action adventure game, developed by Natale Fietta and Stefano Balzani and published by Simulmondo, which was released in Europe in 1993. The Doors are the doors that open onto Virtual Reality. The doors (Door means port in English ...) multiply continuously in the city of Simulman and Cactus and thus, every day, reality de-materializes and the simulation becomes more numerous and credible as reality itself. The Doors of entertainment are very popular now. Refined, money-driven minds are continually creating virtual realities full of simulated dream worlds that they provide all kinds of pleasures: sex, speed, vertigo, strong and new sensations intoxicate. But this costs people a lot, as in drugs: it often costs the loss of one's identity, the end of oneself. This is what is going to happen to the protagonists of this \"Luna Park\".", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Simulmondo", "publishers": "Simulmondo", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCM57K7fnR8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/131490-simulman-6-luna-park\n"}
