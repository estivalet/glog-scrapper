{"altername_name": ["Mini Legion"], "name": "Mini Legi\u00f3n", "overview": "It is a shooter similar the likes of \"Commando\" or \"Rambo\". Some flaws of the precursor have been eliminated that mostly imrprove gameplay. In this game you play as the legion, trained to perform all kinds of missions in a hostile environment. You must rescue the cooperators retained by the locals by any means possible. But beware, nobody will lend you help, the area is totally hostile and even the animals want you out of there, but the mission must go ahead! Can you save them? Will you find the volunteers working in the field organizing camps, digging wells, distributing humanitarian aid? Only you will make sure this is a success!", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2018", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Irongate", "publishers": "", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqOEIZ7eNyE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/155673-mini-legion\n"}
