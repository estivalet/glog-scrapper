{"altername_name": [], "name": "UFO Enemy Unclothed", "overview": "The first demo was released on CU Amiga coverdisk in 1995, then the bigger demo came the same year and you could buy a full game. Finally, it was was released for free through the Aminet in 2006 with the version timestamp 1998. So for Lemonamiga purpose we have 1995, the year since the full game was available. This game is a parody to UFO: Enemy Unknown, written in AMOS. This is one of the weirder titles in the Amiga's library. I can see them after cracking open a few beers at CU Amiga: \"Hey, wouldn't it be HILARIOUS if we could replace all the enemies in UFO: Enemy Unknown with exhibitionists?\" \"Haha, yeah, or replacing the Skyranger with a van from a used car shop.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1998", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Microgadge", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165038-ufo-enemy-unclothed\n"}
