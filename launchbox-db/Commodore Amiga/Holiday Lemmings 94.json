{"altername_name": ["Christmas Lemmings 1994", "Holiday Lemmings 1994"], "name": "Holiday Lemmings 94", "overview": "The 1994 edition of Holiday Lemmings is the second full game in the series of Christmas-themed Lemmings games, after two free demos in 1991 and 1992 and a commercial 1993 version. Gameplay is unchanged from the original game: players are tasked with leading a horde of Lemmings to the level exit by assigning them special abilities. The holiday theme shows in snow-covered landscapes, the Lemmings wearing Christmas outfits and appropriate background music. The game includes 32 all-new levels, grouped into two difficulties: Frost and Hail. It also comes with all 32 levels from the 1993 version (Flurry and Blizzard difficulties).", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "DMA Design", "publishers": "Psygnosis", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.33", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmings_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/k4t0MyZPcAc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/71937-holiday-lemmings-94\n"}
