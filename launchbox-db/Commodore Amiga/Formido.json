{"altername_name": [], "name": "Formido", "overview": "In Formido written by Herbert Klackls, Mika Halttunen, Costel Mincea you have to defeat a plaque of insects. Formido is one of those games, where you are loaded with some guns and you go shooting different things. 'Things' in this case are big, ugly, - not green though - alien insects. The idea is to kill as many of those bastards as possible. Eventually they will overcome you, but struggle as long as you can. There are some power-ups to aid you in your honorable quest. Keep in mind, that those critters are rather tough and generally do nasty things when in close range of any player-characters.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "September 15, 2005", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Costel Mincea", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165354-formido\n"}
