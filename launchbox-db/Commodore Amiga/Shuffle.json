{"altername_name": [], "name": "Shuffle", "overview": "Shuffle is a successor to Atomix and offers the same playing principle: the player has to construct a molecule by combining atoms. Those atoms are spread out over the top-down playfield and can be moved by walking into them with the player character. Once nudged, the atoms don't stop until they meet a wall or another obstacle. All this has to be achieved within a time limit. Also included is the two-player mode known from the predecessor: both players work at the same puzzle, but only the one who finished it gets the points. The players take turns of ten seconds. The main addition to the gameplay mechanics are power ups which can be collected in the levels, e.g. extra time, bonus points or a level skip. The game features 30 regular levels and all five levels the player has the opportunity to improve the high score by playing a bonus level. In addition there are 35 levels which are designed for advanced players.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "SoftTouch", "publishers": "Talesoft", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/92897-shuffle\n"}
