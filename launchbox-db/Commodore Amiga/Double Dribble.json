{"altername_name": [], "name": "Double Dribble", "overview": "Double Dribble is a Sports game, developed and published by Konami Inc, which was released in 1990. This latest in Konami\u2019s ports of their cartridge games isn\u2019t bad, but there are other Amiga basketball games that are better. It gives a very good illusion of 5 on 5 play, but after a while I noticed that it\u2019s really 3 on 3; two players from each team always seem to stay at the other end of the scrolling court. The play is fast and furious, with either a human or computer opponent. Graphics and sound are fair, though I did have some trouble at first keeping track of which guy I was controlling. Solid fare, if nothing outstanding.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.62", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Dribble_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/64963-double-dribble\n"}
