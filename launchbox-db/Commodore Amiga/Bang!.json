{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bang!", "overview": "Pang is a hack of Poing, itself a variation of Breakout. In this adaptation the game is played from left to right. Your task is not to eliminate every block, but to gain access to the back wall, by removing the blocks in front of it, and hit it 10 times, at which point you can go through it onto the next screen. Sets of 8 screens are grouped together, and when you lose the ball on that level you get hurtled back through the previous ones at high speed. If you manage to catch the ball on one of them, you can continue from that level, trying to force the ball back through the end of the level, and get back to where you were.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sport Development", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/160766-bang\n"}
