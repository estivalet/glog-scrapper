{"altername_name": [], "name": "Warcaby", "overview": "A 2 player checkers style board game from Prezemek Szelag released as part of the Polish made Zestaw Gier Logicznych 2 compilation pack. Probably each of you has once played checkers: The game is as old as time, but it is still fun. The board is elegantly made, the pieces move smoothly and blink coquettishly in their free time. There are two difficulty levels available. Owners of monochrome monitors have not been forgotten either. This game differs from the original checkers in that it does not have the so-called ladies. For bringing a plonk to the field on the opposite side, we receive one additional point (if we have already lost one).", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Prezemek Szelag", "publishers": "Arrakis Software", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/372799-warcaby\n"}
