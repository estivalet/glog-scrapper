{"altername_name": [], "name": "Grid Start", "overview": "Grid Start is a Formula 1 racing game played from a third person perspective similar to Pole Position. The game consists of six tracks based on real world locations: Brands Hatch, Silverstone, Belgium, Mexico, Austria and Germany. These can be played in a competition consisting of three laps or in a practice mode with 99 laps (or until the player presses the escape key). In each race there are 23 AI controlled cars to compete against. The game is playable in three difficulties: novice, amateur and professional. The car has six gears that have to be changed manually and a boost feature can also be used for faster acceleration. In addition to racing faster than the opposing drivers the player also has to avoid crashing into the haystacks and the fences that are placed dangerously close to the track.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Anco Software", "publishers": "Anco Software Inc.", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.7", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/94282-grid-start\n"}
