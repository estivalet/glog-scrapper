It was an ambitious project that was meant to carry over to a game series called \"Timeline\" which never happened. You had to guide the character's career through WWI, professions, as he or she gets skill points to distribute. Not many games had skills at all, let alone the plethora of skills to choose from in this game.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Eldritch Games", "publishers": "Electronic Arts, Inc.", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hound_of_Shadow", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-FCxPPgarI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73421-the-hound-of-shadow\n"}
