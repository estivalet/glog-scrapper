{"altername_name": [], "name": "Firezone", "overview": "Following the break up of the old Superpower blocks at the end of the 20th Century colonial wars ravage the world. Powerful beam weapons and defensive energy shields are developed that give a new lease of life to ground warfare and reinforce the place of the Armoured Fighting Vehicle. The new Grav engine means a tank can skim across the battlefield at the speed of a 1980's helicopter gunship and is worth a battalion of the 20th century equivalent. Firezone simulates this new style of combat in which battles are fought in minutes not hours. Although several countries and power blocks are contesting what's left of the World the main protagonists feature in the game and are the European League and the Pacific Combine. You can command either side against human or an artificially intelligent computer opponent in three pre-set scenarios or design and save your own using the game generator.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Arcadia", "publishers": "Personal Software Services", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/91341-firezone\n"}
