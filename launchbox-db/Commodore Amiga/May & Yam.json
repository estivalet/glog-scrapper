{"altername_name": [], "name": "May & Yam", "overview": "May and Yam is a game I created in 1993 for the Amiga 500. It was never released anywhere, and I distributed it for free at computer parties. It was a homage to the game Pang!, which I loved around that time. Obviously, I couldn't reproduce the original, and I made many simplifications, such as substituting the rope by a tennis ball (not sure why I picked a tennis ball...) I didn't have enough time or skills to make everything by myself, so I even ended up ripping some music from other games, and art from here and there. So it's a bit of a collage.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "David Gavilan Ruiz", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW-vbprbgqg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/368386-may-yam\n"}
