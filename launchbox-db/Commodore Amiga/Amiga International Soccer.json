{"altername_name": ["International Soccer (Microdeal)", "A-Soccer", "Amiga Soccer"], "name": "Amiga International Soccer", "overview": "Amiga Soccer (alias International Soccer) is a soccer game in which two teams play against each other. The match itself can be varied with many settings, e.g. difficulty level, weather, half-time length or time of day, but there are no additional playing modes like a league to be found. However, the basic tactical approach can be set before starting the match. When not in ball possession, the active athlete can be switched by pressing a button and the opponent can be tackled. The strength of a kick depends on how long the fire button is pressed.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Microdeal", "publishers": "Microdeal", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "2.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/74375-amiga-international-soccer\n"}
