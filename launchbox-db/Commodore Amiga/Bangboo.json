{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bangboo", "overview": "Yet another puzzler which combines things which have already been done before. You are a bouncing creature which has to clear every level of tiles. You can do this by bouncing against the tiles which have the same colour as your skin. If there are different coloured tiles you must change colour by using \u201cpaint pots\u201d. There are also different baddies which will try to stop you in your task. Well, graphically this game is okay, but the repeating bounce sound is irritating to say the least. Most importantly, the gameplay, which is fun for a little while. The game just isn't original enough to become a very special puzzler I'm afraid.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Millennium Interactive", "publishers": "Millennium Interactive", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.88", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/74868-bangboo\n"}
