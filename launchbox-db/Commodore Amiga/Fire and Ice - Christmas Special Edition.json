{"altername_name": [], "name": "Fire and Ice: Christmas Special Edition", "overview": "The basic idea is to guide Cool Coyote on an exploration of the entire level and locate the six parts of the key. Once all eight parts have been collected, then the exit will open, so it\u2019s simply a matter of finding the thing. The key parts can only be found by destroying the local creatures, which is achieved by freezing them with snowballs then bashing into them. Careful though, dally to long and the creatures will defrost. Along the way there\u2019ll be the chance to pick up bonus present, interact with wales and watch the snow falling down. Watch out also for bonus pups to escort to the exit.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Graftgold Creative Software", "publishers": "Amiga Power", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "http://hol.abime.net/549", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/91321-fire-and-ice-christmas-special-edition\n"}
