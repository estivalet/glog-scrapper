You opponent will grow faster, and more maneuverable. The evil wizard Mangoth has ruled the black forest for centuries. This has caused great suffering for those who dwell on the edge of the woods. You were sent to kill him, caught and turned into one of his dragon-slaves. Now you must fight the 20 dragons of the wizard or they will kill you and destroy your village.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "February 1, 1994", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Michael Wilson", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJNvZtFeH4E", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/372057-dragon-simulator\n"}
