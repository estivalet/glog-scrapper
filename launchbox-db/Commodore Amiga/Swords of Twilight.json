{"altername_name": [], "name": "Swords of Twilight", "overview": "Three years in the making, Swords of Twilight is a gorgeously illustrated fantasy roleplaying adventure. The three members of your party can be played independently by up to three humans using a unique multi-player interface (which is the game's strongest and weakest link) or the computer can control both your companions if you'd rather quest alone. Quirky, non-standard key usage (with no mouse control) is irksome and hampers player maneuverability. The story and characters are lavish and intriguing: with eight parallel worlds to search through for the Swords of Twilight you'll be busy for weeks.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Free Fall Associates", "publishers": "ECP (Entertainment and Computer Products)", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "3", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swords_of_Twilight", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73388-swords-of-twilight\n"}
