{"altername_name": ["Leisure Suit Larry 5: Passionate Patti Macht Beim Geheimdienst Mit"], "name": "Leisure Suit Larry 5: Passionate Patti Does a Little Undercover Work", "overview": "Passionate Patti Does a Little Undercover Work! is (despite the number) the fourth game in Al Lowe's Leisure Suit Larry series. The middle-aged would-be-womanizer Larry Laffer fell off a boat during a cruise and sustained amnesia, forgetting how he and his sweetheart Patti got separated, how Larry got a job in LA, how Patti got a job with the FBI, and what happened in (the never released) Larry 4. Now Larry and Patti are working independently on two cases that are connected to each other, even though the heroes aren't aware of that. Larry's new bosses are involved in shady business, while Patti agrees to take a break from her career as a performing pianist and become an undercover agent. Will the two be together ever again? Unlike the previous games with their text input, Larry 5 utilizes a graphical, icon-based interface. The player uses verb commands (\"Look\", \"Talk\", \"Use\" etc.) to interact with the environment. In a way not quite typical for Sierra's adventure games, it is impossible to \"die\" in Larry 5, and the amount of \"dead ends\" (unwinnable situations) is greatly reduced. The game is also less puzzle-oriented, allowing the player to proceed even if he/she fails to solve the required puzzle in some cases. However, the player is awarded more points for finding the \"right\" solution. As in the third game, both Larry and Patti are available as playable characters during different chapters of the story.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Sierra", "publishers": "Sierra", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.36", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leisure_Suit_Larry_5:_Passionate_Patti_Does_a_Little_Undercover_Work", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/41126-leisure-suit-larry-5-passionate-patti-does-a-little-undercover-work\n"}
