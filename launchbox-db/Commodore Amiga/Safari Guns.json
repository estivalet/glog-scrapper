{"altername_name": [], "name": "Safari Guns", "overview": "You are on safari to make a photo report to save the local animal world from extinction. How the game works is simple. Animals will move into the screen and, after some time, leave the screen. Meanwhile you must photograph them. Besides the animals, there also poachers, which have to be shot with your real weapon. Kill them fast, or they will kill you. If you kill an animal, then you get some penalty points. The game itself offers different locations, from the desert to the jungle and a variety of different animals, like zebras, elephants, and others.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "New-Deal Productions S.A.", "publishers": "Infogrames Europe SA", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/102077-safari-guns\n"}
