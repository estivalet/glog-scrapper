{"altername_name": [], "name": "George and the Repton-Clone", "overview": "George and the Repton-clone is a clone of an old BBC game (later released on the ZX Spectrum) Repton 2. You start on the main level, which contains a number of teleporters leading to the other levels. The object of the game is to collect all of the diamonds on each level, and then reach the exit, which will take you back to the main level, which you should clear of teleporters. This makes the game slightly less linear, and allows you to practice harder levels - you don't have to do the levels in order, but you may block the entrance to some levels if you don't.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1998", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Harlequin", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/100876-george-and-the-repton-clone\n"}
