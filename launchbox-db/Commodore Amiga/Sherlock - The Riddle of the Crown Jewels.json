{"altername_name": ["Sherlock Holmes: The Riddle of the Crown Jewels"], "name": "Sherlock: The Riddle of the Crown Jewels", "overview": "In The Riddle of the Crown Jewels, you play the role of Doctor Watson. You have received an urgent summons to the rooms of your good friend Sherlock Holmes by his landlady, Mrs. Hudson. Normally you are not up and about so early on a Saturday. But here you are, outside the Baker Street residence, and not a moment too soon; for the fog has thickened and travel without a lamp has become impossible. Infocom's Sherlock is infinitely better than the bug-ridden attempt by Melbourne House some years ago. It is not played in real time, but the day and time is displayed on the screen, only ticking away at each move you make. But remember \u2013 you do have a deadline to retrieve the jewels! Altogether, this is a mystery that conveys just about the right atmosphere for the place, time, and subject, with a good helping of general historical interest thrown in as well. I take my hat off to it. Now that is something I could recommend you to do before you get very far into the game, too!", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Infocom", "publishers": "Infocom", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock:_The_Riddle_of_the_Crown_Jewels", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73022-sherlock-the-riddle-of-the-crown-jewels\n"}
