{"altername_name": ["Space Station: Part I"], "name": "Space Station", "overview": "Space Station is a platform action adventure in which the player takes the role of a space ship commander. The station is attacked by aliens and must be destroyed. Sadly, the floppy disk with the destruction code is hidden somewhere in the 99 rooms and must be found first. To be able to escape from the station, fuel for a space ship has to be collected during the way. The player can jump and shoot, although before using the weapon, ammunition packs must be found and therefore using the pistol is very limited. In the station robots and aliens are attacking and lifts, teleporters and jump-pads allow the player to navigate through the many different connections between the rooms. The screen flicks between the rooms, no scrolling is involved. There is only one life, but a generous energy level, which is decreased on contact with enemies. No falling damage occurs, but jumping into the void instantly ends the game.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Paradox Software", "publishers": "Eidersoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1", "wikipedia": "https://www.mobygames.com/game/amiga/space-station", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/108357-space-station\n"}
