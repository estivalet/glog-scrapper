{"altername_name": ["Mouse Quest"], "name": "Mouse Trap", "overview": "Ported from the Atari ST game of the same name, this is a platform game in the tradition of Manic Miner. Simple in set up but tough to beat. The graphics were outdated by the time it got to the Amiga, but in a charming throwback kind of way that seems to fit. You might even call it old-fashioned fun. This platform game challenges the player to guide a mouse around a screen collecting goodies - varying from cheese to cakes to balloons. Once they have all been collected you must reach the door, doing all of this within the time limit, depicted by a picture of a diffusing bomb. The player will have to jump over flowers, dodge bouncing balls and dinosaurs amongst other things - contact with any of these loses a life. Movement is achieved along ledges, via clouds, moving platforms and up ladders. Short falls can be withstood, but larger ones (or heavy landings from jumps) are fatal.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Brian Jobling", "publishers": "Microvalue", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tGMrjw8Rac", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/96759-mouse-trap\n"}
