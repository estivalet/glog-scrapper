{"altername_name": [], "name": "No Second Prize", "overview": "There is indeed no second prize in this race between 6 of the world\u2019s toughest riders. First prize is the one remaining model of the greatest motorbike the world has ever seen, incidentally. The graphics are polygon based, with lots of roadside detail, and leaning into corners to maximise turn-in leads to the graphics to tilt appropriately. The control is mouse-based, allowing for slight adjustments to be made and ensuring that the controls are realistic but not impossible. As well as your five rivals, there are lots of Sunday riders on the roads, distinguished by having brown bikes, so make sure to avoid these. This was one of the first games to feature video-style replays, allowing you to find the exact moment you want to replay, from any part of the race, and view it at normal speed, double-speed, or freeze-frame. The camera angles on offer here include one that follows the bike, one that views the track from the side, and a TV-style chase view.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Thalion Software", "publishers": "Thalion Software", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/30006-no-second-prize\n"}
