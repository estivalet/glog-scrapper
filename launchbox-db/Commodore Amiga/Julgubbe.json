{"altername_name": [], "name": "Julgubbe", "overview": "A 1991 game created by Nikki Corruptions with AMOS and released as freeware. A simple mini game. Watch out for the imitation Santa and shoot him! Don't blast any real Santas or innocent reindeer...not EVEN DONNER! The line of festive travelers gets faster the longer you play and a missed shot will subtract 2 points. 9 bad Santa shots and the game ends and you have to go talk to your relatives and drink virgin eggnog. So check your targets!!", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nikki Corruptions", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCVECsz3Jl8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/372164-julgubbe\n"}
