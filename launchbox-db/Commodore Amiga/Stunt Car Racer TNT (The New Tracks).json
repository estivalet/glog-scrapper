{"altername_name": [], "name": "Stunt Car Racer TNT (The New Tracks)", "overview": "This game was created by AmiGer/CARE by modifying the original game Stunt Car Racer. The TNT of the title stands for \"The New Tracks\". A track designer was written in Delphi and used to create 8 new tracks to race. The title screen and menu screen have been modified, as well as the colour palette. The disk version has the track colours incorrect in the track preview window - they retain the reds from the original. The WHDLoad version fixes this problem. 2-player mode via null-modem connection.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2004", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "AmiGer", "publishers": "Homebrew Software", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "8", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a-BXr6X5PM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/108369-stunt-car-racer-tnt-the-new-tracks\n"}
