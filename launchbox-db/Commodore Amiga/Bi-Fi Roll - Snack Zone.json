{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bi-Fi Roll: Snack Zone", "overview": "Snack Zone is a German-language promotional adventure game. The plot is that secret documents have gone missing from the factory that makes Bi-Fi Rolls (a kind of salami-based snack) and without them, production has been forced to halt, and supplies will run out in a few days. You play the role of a man called Lukas, and it is your responsibility to scour the city and recover these documents as quickly as possible. The game is controlled with the joystick: you can walk left and right, and press up to go through an exit or talk to a character you are standing next to. At the bottom of the screen is a panel that shows the inventory items you are carrying, as well as three stats: your physical energy, your emotional wellbeing, and your snack levels. While completing your main task, you will also need to make sure these stats are kept topped up, which you can do by buying snacks from street kiosks and by helping people you meet solve their problems.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "The Art Department", "publishers": "Bi-Fi Roll", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/131198-bi-fi-roll-snack-zone\n"}
