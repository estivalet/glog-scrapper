{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bram Stoker's Dracula", "overview": "One of several adaptations of the 1992 film version of the classic vampire tale, the Amiga version is a side-scrolling action game. The player controls Jonathan Harker, who, on his quest to destroy the Transylvanian vampire, must make his way through nine levels, starting at a tavern near Dracula's castle and then the castle itself. Back in England, Dracula and his minions must be driven out of a convent, an abbey and the house of Jonathan's fianc\u00e9e Mina, among others. A primary task in each level is to find and destroy several coffins of Transylvanian earth. Hindering Jonathan on his way are henchmen as well as critters under the vampire's control: bats, rats, snakes and more. The last coffin in each location is usually guarded by one of Dracula's stronger minions, which include his three brides, the madman Renfield, and Mina's friend Lucy, now turned undead. To defeat the enemies, Jonathan uses punches and kicks. Lost health can be regained by finding potions; extra lives are also available. In addition, Dr. Van Helsing has left holy crosses lying about - once picked up, they enable a powerful ranged holy attack, which only lasts for a short time, however. Staircases and doors connect the different parts of the levels - to open doors, keys must first be found.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Psygnosis", "publishers": "Psygnosis", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.95", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bram_Stoker%27s_Dracula_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAUr73Nl-lU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/71866-bram-stokers-dracula\n"}
