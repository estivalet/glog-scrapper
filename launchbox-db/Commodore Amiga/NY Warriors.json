{"altername_name": ["New York Warriors", "Delta Command"], "name": "NY Warriors", "overview": "NY Warriors (New York Warriors in Europe) is a fun top-down shooter that recalls Quicksilver's Heavy Barrel, although it is much less well-known. As a lone commando, your job is to rescue New York City from various gangs that are wrecking havoc. Each stage takes place in a nondescript New York location, with varied backdrops and excellent attention to detail. What makes New York Warriors a lot of fun is the variety of enemies and weapons you can pick up and use. The gangs that control each location also have their own attack styles and weapons, and naturally the challenge increases with each location you advance. Another high point is the fact that each mission's objective is different: in some locations, all you have to do is get from point A to B without getting killed, while in others you may be asked to secure a bridge by destroying guarding tanks. The action is furious, and user controls are responsive. Fans of Cabal and similar commando-type shooters should really enjoy this one, although don't expect it to be a groundbreaking title.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Synergistic Software", "publishers": "Virgin Mastertronic", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9X6A7GSOF0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72553-ny-warriors\n"}
