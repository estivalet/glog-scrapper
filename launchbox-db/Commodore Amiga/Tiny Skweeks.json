{"altername_name": ["The Brainies"], "name": "Tiny Skweeks", "overview": "This puzzle game has 101 levels, in which you have to guide a varying number of Brainies of four different colors onto a spot that matches their color. You control a cross-hair, and press fire while over a Brainy to take or give up control of its motion. Running out of time costs you a life. The challenge lies in the fact that you can only control the direction in which a Brainy will walk. Once this is set, he will continue to walk until he hits a wall, an obstacle or another Brainy. To make things a bit more complicated, there are various obstacles like arrows that change the direction a Brainy is walking in and items than can optionally be picked up.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atreid Concept", "publishers": "Loriciel", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brainies", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/110036-tiny-skweeks\n"}
