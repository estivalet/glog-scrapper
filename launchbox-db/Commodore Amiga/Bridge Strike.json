{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bridge Strike", "overview": "Bridge Strike sees you take control of an aircraft fighter as you fly into combat against insurmountable odds with the sole objective of eliminating as many enemies as you can. The aim of the game is to accumulate as much points you can by destroying various on screen objects. You will come across bridges which must be destroyed. Destroyed bridges act as a checkpoint from which the game begins, when your aircraft crashes. When your last aircraft crashes, the game ends. The shooting mechanism is borrowed from River Raid in that you can steer the bullets after they have been shot\u2026but beware that doing this also moves your plane in the same direction and if you\u2019re not attentive when doing this, you\u2019ll find your plane crashing into the side of the canyon environment. In addition to navigating the landscape, you will have to deal with a number of enemy units, ranging from ordinary patrol boats to complex automatic rocket systems. Fortunately, your aircraft is equipped with an endless supply of rockets. However, your fuel supply is not endless so you will have to keep an eye out on the gauge at the bottom of the screen and make sure you fly over friendly aircraft carriers to automatically refuel.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2019", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Project R3D", "publishers": "Project R3D", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/R5Yj64EWhaE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/149628-bridge-strike\n"}
