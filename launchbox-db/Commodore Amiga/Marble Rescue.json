The ball will travel forward and will tend towards right turns as it hits flat walls, but will follow the wall if it hits a corner. You have a limited amount of directionals allowed: Up, down, left and right markers that will tell the ball to follow them. Use them to avoid the bombs and to get all the dots and make it to the exit spot!", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Oliver Michel", "publishers": "CompuTec Verlag", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yL2ilXaXkLk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164213-marble-rescue\n"}
