{"altername_name": [], "name": "Emerald Mine II", "overview": "Emerald Mine II is an Boulder Dash variant and features no gameplay changes in comparison to its predecessor besides the new level editor. The player's goal is to collect diamonds which are surrounded by dirt. When walking over an dirt spot, it is cleared and an stone above it will fall down - with unhealthy results if the player or a monster is hit by it. Other items are dynamite to clear out boulders and keys for certain doors. The need to plan ahead and find out the required steps to reach the diamonds give the game a puzzle-solving character. Besides the about hundred levels in single-player, there are additional levels for two players.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Kingsoft", "publishers": "Kingsoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/9532-emerald-mine-ii\n"}
