{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Lost Prince", "overview": "The Lost Prince is a fantasy point & click graphic adventure for the Amiga, created in AMOS. The game has a LucasArts-style action bar with six mode buttons: \"Examine\", \"Use\", \"Use ... on\", \"Take\", \"Talk to\" and \"Options\". Use the left mouse button to walk and to select action buttons, and the right mouse button to perform an action on a selected object or character. The pathfinding algorithm is imperfect, and sometimes you will need to guide the character manually around obstacles by clicking several points along the way. The main character is young Prince Rindlepoke, who lived in a magnificent castle and liked to play the harp. One day he was kidnapped and taken away on a ship, but a sudden storm gave him the opportunity to escape. The game begins as he washes up alone on an unfamiliar beach. From here, there are a few places he can walk to: a cave near the top of a large hill, a dark grey stone castle with a moat, and several small businesses operating in the local village. The Lost Prince was the second graphic adventure released by DTO Software, after \"Starbase 13\" (1993). The engine created for The Lost Prince later formed the basis of GR.A.C., an adventure game authoring system released in 1995.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "DTO Software", "publishers": "DTO Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161025-the-lost-prince\n"}
