You are in control of a small vehicle, which allows you to move boxes and barrels to their destination easily. One day, after a big load has just arrived, you are asked to move the whole goods received to their destination. Happily you start without to know what will expect you. After a short time, you notice that the whole load is in a mess and it will take you a lot of time and reflection to move everything into the right place.
