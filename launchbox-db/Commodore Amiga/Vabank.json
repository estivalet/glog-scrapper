Falling from great heights and contact with prison inhabitants means a loss of energy. Energy levels may be supplemented by picking up heart items. Hostile prisoners may be stunned by throwing various fruit. Some places may only be accessed after finding the proper gate cards. A single player platformer where you go around turning switches so you can enter new areas, you get sparse ammo by collecting fruits. Every time a baddie touches you, you lose some energy. Wrenches and keys are needed to progress. Hearts bring your energy level back up.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Rafa\u0142 W\u00f3jcik", "publishers": "L.K.
