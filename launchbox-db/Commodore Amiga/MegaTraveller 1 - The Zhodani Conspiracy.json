{"altername_name": [], "name": "MegaTraveller 1: The Zhodani Conspiracy", "overview": "Life in the 51st century it rougher than ever. Mankind, now under the rule of the Third Imperium, has realised his dream to reach into the stars, and has made contact with all manner of weird and wonderful alien life-forms for his trouble. The most alarming of these extra-terrestrial contacts, made in 5018, was with a virtually identical race known as the Zhodani. The contact was not a pleasant one, however, and the first of four Frontier Wars soon broke out between the two races. You'd think that after four bouts of inter-stellar genocide the two sides would have had enough, but, for reasons best known to themselves, a group of corrupt officials within the Imperium is preparing to start a fifth \u2013 and, as always, there's only one person that can stop them. Well five people actually. Barely 10 minutes ago, your merry band of travellers was having a quiet drink when a frantic young lady pushed a holographic disk into your hands, burbled something about a traitor and was attacked by a group of thugs. You made your excuses and left... quickly. Now it seems there's a price on your head and every bounty hunter in the galaxy is on your tail. So, to take stock of your situation: you hold the only evidence which can expose the traitors and have to deliver it to the officials on some faraway planet - all of this under the less-than-friendly scrutiny of the meanest villains in the cosmos, never rains but it pours.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Oxford Digital Enterprises", "publishers": "Empire Software", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.33", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MegaTraveller_1:_The_Zhodani_Conspiracy", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72329-megatraveller-1-the-zhodani-conspiracy\n"}
