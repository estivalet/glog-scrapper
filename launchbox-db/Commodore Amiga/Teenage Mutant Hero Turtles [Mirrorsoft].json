The game was released in Japan through Konami themselves, then in North America through Konami's Ultra Games imprint, followed by a release through the European equivalent , Palcom Software, in PAL regions. This was the first Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles video game, and is based on the 1987 TV series, which was in its third season at the time of the game's original release, although the art style more resembles the original TMNT comic series. The game was ported to various home computer platforms in 1990, including the Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum and Amiga. The DOS version is infamous, as it contains a gap that is impossible to cross without cheating.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Daisysoft", "publishers": "Mirrorsoft", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.33", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_(NES_video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/110151-teenage-mutant-hero-turtles-mirrorsoft\n"}
