{"altername_name": ["Italy Soccer '90"], "name": "Italy '90 Soccer", "overview": "Another football game, yet again based upon the 1990 World Cup. At least Simulmondo are an Italian software house, which can\u2019t be bad considering it\u2019s the host nation. Simulmondo have looked into their (cracked) crystal ball, and found only eight competing teams. Matches are between six and ten minutes long and are viewed as if watching from the stands. Sprites are very small (although their boots are comparitively huge) and badly animated \u2014 they look like they\u2019re doing the can-can. Effects are few and are the usual screeches. It\u2019s difficult to know what to say here. The pathetic graphics are overwhelmingly off-putting, and when you force yourself to play, it\u2019s just as slow and dull as expected. Italy Soccer \u201890 is as old-fashioned in it\u2019s gameplay as it is in it\u2019s graphics.
