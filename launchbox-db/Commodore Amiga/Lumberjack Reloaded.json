{"altername_name": [], "name": "Lumberjack Reloaded", "overview": "This is fan-made conversion of the C64 homebrew game Lumberjack. Visuals and music have been improved, gameplay is virtually the same. You are a Lumberjack who tries to chop down a tree as fast as he can without getting hit by branches from above. Sometimes women's clothing is stuck in the branches and collecting it will net you a nice bonus. I am not certain, but this might be inspiried by Monthy Python's skit \"The Lumberjack Song\".", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2017", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Cobe", "publishers": "CDLabel", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm_fXT3DpgI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161016-lumberjack-reloaded\n"}
