{"altername_name": [], "name": "A Prehistoric Tale", "overview": "Play the role of a time traveler whose job is to rescue dinosaur eggs from an unsafe environment so they can have a chance to evolve into mammals. Your progress will be impeded by those dinosaurs that have time to hatch. Fortunately, these beasts are afraid of mice which you can set loose in certain locations. A Prehistoric Tale is a non-scrolling 2-D platformer. Kill enemies by jumping on them. Alternately, hatched dinosaurs can be temporarily caged by jumping over them. This game is essentially a remake of Dino Eggs for the Commodore 64.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "The Lost Boys", "publishers": "Thalion Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.38", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Prehistoric_Tale", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPtKYpX9YhU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/8987-a-prehistoric-tale\n"}
