{"altername_name": [], "name": "Deal or No Deal", "overview": "A freeware game from Lee Hurley Productions, made in 2011 based on the TV show of the same name. A contestant chooses one briefcase from a selection of 26. Each briefcase contains a cash value from $0.01 to $1,000,000. Over the course of the game, the contestant eliminates cases from the game, periodically being presented with a \"deal\" from The Banker to take a cash amount to quit the game. Should the contestant refuse every deal, they are given the chance to trade the case they chose at the outset for the only one left in play at the time; they then win the amount in the selected case.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2011", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Lee Hurley Productions", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Quiz", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/372985-deal-or-no-deal\n"}
