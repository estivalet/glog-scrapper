{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure", "overview": "Bill S. Preston and Ted (Theodore) Logan, high school party animals and self-confessed cool dudes are destined for great things. Namely, founding a religion and being idolized by future generations because of their most 'bodacious' Californian interpretation of both the English language and Heavy Metal music. However, this will never happen if they flunk high school. This looks very likely until Rufus, a messenger from the future, sent to save mankind appears giving them the chance to get an A+ grade by doing a 'most excellent' history presentation. This involves bringing dead dudes like Socrates and Freud back from the past to present day San Dimas, to relate their own real life histories! Equipped with a totally out of this world telephone booth, Bill and Ted have to dial historic dates and travel back to twelve different points in time to pick up the requisite number of dead dudes. This is either six or twelve, depending on the difficulty level. The graphics are colorful but poorly drawn except for some digitized screens from the movie. Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure is fatally let down by a lack of depth both in the overall game design and on each level.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Off The Wall Productions", "publishers": "Capstone Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_%26_Ted%27s_Excellent_Adventure_(1990_video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/61710-bill-teds-excellent-adventure\n"}
