{"altername_name": [], "name": "Amiga Lazer Zone", "overview": "Amiga Lazer Zone is based on Jeff Minter's 1983 shoot'em'up Laser Zone for c64. It has you controlling not one, but two \"zone gunners\" in a constrained playfield. Controlled with only one joystick, you move one zone gunner on a vertical wall and one at the bottom. Wave upon wave of nasties come into the zone and must be shot down before they reach either wall, where they will advance towards the gun, finally destroying it.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "April 26, 1990", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Phenomena", "publishers": "Phenomena", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdBzhe-cZDI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/159472-amiga-lazer-zone\n"}
