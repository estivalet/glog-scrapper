{"altername_name": [], "name": "Switchblade", "overview": "After 10,000 years of peace on the cyber world of Thraxx, the magic Fireblade has shattered and the evil Havok has come to power. Only one brave Bladeknight, Hiro, has survived. But before he can take on Havok the sixteen fragments of the Fireblade, scattered throughout five levels of the below-ground Undercity, must be found. Hostile creatures attack Hiro and can be destroyed by hand-to-hand combat or various missiles fired from Hiro's cyberarm. Some of the bricks in the walls of each level may be smashed to reveal bonuses. There are plenty of new creatures to see, but why there has to be continual use of dull gray backdrops I don't know \u2013 pity as otherwise this is a good futuristic romp.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Core Design", "publishers": "Gremlin Graphics Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.31", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switchblade_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNDlgd647jE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73369-switchblade\n"}
