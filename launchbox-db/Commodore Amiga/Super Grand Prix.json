{"altername_name": [], "name": "Super Grand Prix", "overview": "An updated 16-bit version of Codemasters' Grand Prix Simulator. As before, the basic gameplay resembles Super Sprint, with an overhead view of simple tracks incorporating hairpins, oil slicks and underpasses. The game now features 4 modes of play - Formula 1 cars, motorbikes, drag racers, and a mode featuring a variety of vehicles. These include those 3 as well as police cars, go-karts and a tank, which is too slow to be competitive but allows you to shoot out the other cars, and can be a blockade as you try to lap it. Up to 6 cars can be featured in each race, and you can race over 3,4 or 5 laps. Four human players are supported, 2 on joysticks and 2 on keyboard", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Codemasters Software", "publishers": "Codemasters Software", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/104977-super-grand-prix\n"}
