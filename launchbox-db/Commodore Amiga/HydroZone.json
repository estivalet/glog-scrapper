{"altername_name": [], "name": "HydroZone", "overview": "This is art. An unforgettable experience. A combination of pumping techno beats, psychedelic visuals, and challenging gameplay that will keep you glued to the screen. Released on Amiga Action No. 63, Disk 3. An updated version (Special Edition) was released as Freeware in 2010 by the author. HydroZone is a first person runner game, with the camera constantly moving forward through vast tunnels full of obstacles that the player must avoid. The controls are basic, with the player being able to move the camera left, right, up and down to dodge past brightly coloured blocks, and using the control button to shoot, when needed. Hitting the blocks reduces your energy bar, and colliding with the blocks enough times ends the game.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "David J.
