{"altername_name": ["Franco Girardelli Hockey"], "name": "Hockey Pista", "overview": "Hockey Pista simulates the sport of roller hockey. Matches are played on a single screen over a duration set by the player (for single matches). The human player always controls the skater closest to the ball and the goalkeeper at the same time, though the goalkeeper only moves sideways. The game offers single matches against the CPU or in 2-player mode, as well as a championship. The player's team name and colors are customizable. An updated re-release of the game was sponsored by Italian professional player Franco Girardelli, then in Roller Monza. This version features minor graphical improvements, faster gameplay and a few other tweaks such as splitting matches into halves. The difficulty level is not selectable in this version. It is otherwise the same game as the non-sponsored version.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "LindaSoft", "publishers": "Aurea", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/131263-hockey-pista\n"}
