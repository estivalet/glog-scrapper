{"altername_name": [], "name": "Shuffle Pix", "overview": "Shuffle Pix is a sliding puzzle game without variations to the known playing principle. The playfield is a 5x5 grid and on each tile except one is a part of a scrambled picture. The player's job is to slide the tiles in the correct order within a time limit by using the empty tile as buffer. There are three playing modes: one with complete pictures like a clock, one with abstract colour combinations and a training mode. The desired end result is shown besides the playing grid and there are small animations to see after beating a level.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Techno-Design", "publishers": "Magic Soft", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/131487-shuffle-pix\n"}
