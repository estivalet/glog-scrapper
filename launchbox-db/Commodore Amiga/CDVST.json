{"altername_name": ["CertainDeathViaSpaceThings"], "name": "CDVST", "overview": "CDVST stands for CertainDeathViaSpaceThings. It is a Shoot Em up, dont we all just love them? In it there are 3 unique types of power-ups right now, red is spread shots, purple is catalyst shots, and the other 3 (yellow, blue, and green) all clear the screen of enemies. The two shot power-ups are additive, meaning they can both be active at the same time, if you manage to live long enough to get a purple and red power-up. HOW TO PLAY: You are only allowed to move sideways, use the right and left arrow keys for that. Space fires. Holding the fire button let's you charge your projectile distruptor, when it's fully charged hit the left ctrl button to clear the screen of all shots (your's and theirs).", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "November 17, 2005", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Phoenix Kokido", "publishers": "", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165020-cdvst\n"}
