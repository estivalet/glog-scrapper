{"altername_name": [], "name": "Death Rally", "overview": "An open source conversion of the original DOS overhead racing game. Like in the original, you start out from the bottom of the ranking list. Your objective: earn money in the fast-paced battle races. Fight hard for each precious championship point. Fellow competitors are showering you in a constant hail of bullets. Each race is deadly contest - a matter of life or death. Prepare to be blown away, literally. Race for the finish line, leaving a trail of burnt rubber and spent brass behind you\u2026 along with the flaming wreckage of anyone reckless enough to get in your way. Pick up more ammo and turbo from the side of the track, and floor the pedal while performing some shady deals for The Dealer. No trick is too dirty when you're preparing for The Final Confrontation. Only the hardest armor, the most powerful engine and the biggest guns will see you through the ultimate battle against The Adversary. And when you feel you can't take it anymore, you can check out the underground market. Spiked bumpers, landmines, rocket fuel or sabotage can provide a way to create some nasty accidents for the competition.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "April 12, 2023", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "BSzili", "publishers": "Apogee Software", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/368356-death-rally\n"}
