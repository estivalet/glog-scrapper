{"altername_name": [], "name": "Reunion", "overview": "Reunion is a strategy game where players must manage the resources and development of a colony. From a central command area, players select from among different menus to control different aspects of the colony. Many of these menus also need the appropriate personnel in charge (commanders), whose skills and price tag vary. Typical menus include: The research screen where specific areas are selected, the production/buy menu which turns resources into goods, the colony building menu where construction can be scheduled and the colony's facilities managed, the galactic map where new planets are chosen for a closer look, and eventually colonization. Players can also consult with their commanders or go to \"space local\", the nearby bar for all the gossip. In order to produce new material, the player has six different minerals to mine and discover on various planets in the solar system.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Amnesty Design", "publishers": "Grandslam Video", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.11", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reunion_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycD1v9E8kYo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/82354-reunion\n"}
