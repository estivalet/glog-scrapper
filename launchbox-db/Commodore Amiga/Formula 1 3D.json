{"altername_name": [], "name": "Formula 1 3D", "overview": "Formula 1 3D is a Racing game, developed and published by Simulmondo, which was released in Europe in 1991. Simulmondo was running warm-up laps with Formula 1: They promise fast 3D action with variable detail, giving players the choice of true speed or high realism but at the end this was a wasted opportunity from Simulmondo to make a good racing simulation game. They mixed some arcade elements (timer, few laps, easy handling, no damage) with a bit of simulation. Unfortunately, the mix didn't get well and the result was a dull game (considering also that there was just only one circuit). On the other hand, the downs become up when played hotseat with a friend. Play it with some friends and game is really enjoyable.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Simulmondo", "publishers": "Simulmondo", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.62", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVsxOr4igpQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/66751-formula-1-3d\n"}
