{"altername_name": [], "name": "Silver Star", "overview": "An exact clone of the game URIDIUM for the C64, this clone was created by Marcel Wolter, graphics by Arndt Rueger and Marcel Wolter and music Hans-Hermann Franck and released in 1992. Like Uridium it is a 2D, top down, horizontally scrolling shooter without bosses. Press F1 to drop bombs. 15 carrier spaceships have garrisoned your galaxy and each of these ships tries to steal a valuable metal. Destroy the defending forces of each ship and land on them, to accomplish the mission. On the spaceships there are several obstacles against which you quickly bang. Some aims, which you have to destroy, are positioned behind obstacles. Hence you have to fly back a few times to get at these aims. There are also canons which cannot be destroyed, but they send out drones which follow the player. Furthermore there are other things which can be destroyed. That's why the motto is: \"shoot at anything which stands out from the background!\"", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Marcel Wolter", "publishers": "media GmbH", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/368303-silver-star\n"}
