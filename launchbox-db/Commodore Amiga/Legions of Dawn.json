{"altername_name": ["Black Dawn 3: Legions of Dawn"], "name": "Legions of Dawn", "overview": "After the total overwhelming defeat of the aliens that Black Dawn II dealt with, you were betrayed and thrown back into the jail of the Interplanetary Space and Time Report (KGB analogue). However, you managed to escape and release another eight prisoners with the sole purpose of finding Kane where you were imprisoned for seven years and which in the meantime became home to demons, battered humanoids, various androids, and other monsters. Here you have to catch up with your biggest enemy - traitor Nick. To achieve your goal, you have to break over 20 (in full version) of the strength of evil and, of course, survive, which, as we will be talking about, is not that simple. In the initial election you must first select your hero from the nine possible ones. Initial choice depends to a certain extent, because everyone has different equipment, different numbers of money, and has different qualities. Once you've chosen, you can either read instructions for control, and so on, where you can really read a lot of useful things or start playing.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Black Dragon Design", "publishers": "F1 Licenceware", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "http://hol.abime.net/4009", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/ueAfNaiIjQE?t=3m37s", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/100325-legions-of-dawn\n"}
