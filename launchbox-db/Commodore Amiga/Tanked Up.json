{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tanked Up", "overview": "Tanked Up is a one player game of tank combat. You are driving a rocket firing tank around in a maze-like arena. The arena is populated with computer controlled tanks hell-bent on destroying you. Your mission is either to destroy all the enemy or escape from the level. Shortly after the game begins, enemy tanks are added to the arena by means of teleportation devices, they will soon start to hunt you down. Every level has a maximum simultaneous number of tanks in the game at one time (this is set by the skill level). There is a finite number of tanks for each level based on skill setting, once you kill past this point no more tanks will be spawned. Each rocket impact causes 1 point of armor damage. Enemy tanks take four hits to destroy. You can drive through automatic doors and pick up rocket packs and armor boost to refresh your depleted supplies.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1998", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "R.Strickland", "publishers": "", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxQNccqw5oU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164687-tanked-up\n"}
