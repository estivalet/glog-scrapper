{"altername_name": [], "name": "Butcher Hill", "overview": "Intelligence reports suggest that POWs have been captured and are being held hostage at the guerilla outpost on Butcher Hill. The game is divided into three sections. Section One - The River: Travel along the river in your inflatable dinghy to one of the three jetties. Your progress will be hampered by natural obstacles such as twists in the river, boulders and reeds. You must also avoid floating mines and a barrage of gunfire from the enemy aircraft. Section Two - The Jungle: Leaving your dinghy behind you venture into the jungle with only your compass and the knowledge that the enemy village is to the North East. As you make your way through the dense vegetation, you come across clearings where the enemy forces have set up supply depots. Section Three - The Village: You have battled your way along the river and through the dense jungle to the enemy village which is in the shadow of Butcher Hill. Use your machine gun and grenades to eliminate the enemy soldiers who will be running towards you.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Imagitec Design", "publishers": "Gremlin Graphics Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butcher_Hill", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75229-butcher-hill\n"}
