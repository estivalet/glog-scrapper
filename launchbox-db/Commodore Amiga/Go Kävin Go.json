{"altername_name": [], "name": "Go K\u00e4vin Go", "overview": "The game is a solid platformer with a main character that doesn't have any attacks. It controls well enough and has decent graphics for a budget release. There is no ingame music, only sound effects and the occasional speech sample to cheer you on. One problem I had with the game was that it is sometimes not clear if an object is in the background or will block your path.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Harald M\u00fcller", "publishers": "Schatztruhe", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUhsxGs58bg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161942-go-kavin-go\n"}
