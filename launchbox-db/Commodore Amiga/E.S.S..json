{"altername_name": ["E.S.S.: European Space Simulator", "E.S.S."], "name": "E.S.S.", "overview": "Rather than set it in the present day Tomahawk have decided to use the 2010 as their setting for a shuttle launch. Unlike the Arthur C Clarke novel, technology has hardly progressed. Shuttles are used for much the same purposes as they are nowadays: transport, research and repair. The only thing now is that laser guns are standard fitting and useful for blasting crippled satellites before they spread themselves over the Aussie outback. A fairly enjoyable game. Although it fails to push back the boundaries of computer entertainment, it's good fun. Nevertheless, compared to Apollo 18 on the 64, ESS just doesn't match up.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Coktel Vision", "publishers": "Tomahawk", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90246-ess\n"}
