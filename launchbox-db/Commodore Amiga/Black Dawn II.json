{"altername_name": [], "name": "Black Dawn II", "overview": "Will you just look at those dark, moody graphics. Fab, aren't they? And it's one of those first-person perspective role-playing fighting fantasy things as well -things just could get any better really, could they? There is of course the usual plot to draw you into the game, but really all you need to know is that it is your task to wander around each level, clearing it of nasty alien type things, and then moving on to the next world. Simple, yet effective. The control system works nicely and the rest of the icons are nicely laid out and easy to use. It's also easy to get hold of and use objects and the game breaks you in very nicely indeed - the first few levels are small but you get a few levels in and things really start to heal up. A dark and atmospheric first-person seek and destroy adventure that should appeal to everyone. If you don't like this, you must be dead.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Black Dragon Design", "publishers": "Black Dragon Design", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75020-black-dawn-ii\n"}
