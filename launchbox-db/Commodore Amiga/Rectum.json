{"altername_name": [], "name": "Rectum", "overview": "Dark hours approaches mankind. Half of the population have succumbed to an epidemic of something very unpleasant, which like an uncontrollable nuclear reaction has spread itself across the planet Earth. Anarchy and Beat Kaalsson reigns among the survivors. Chaos prevails everywhere. The only spoken language is the naked, brutal and unmerciful language of violence. War sweeps over countries like tornadoes on rape-fields and devastates everything in its way. Is this the end of mankind?Is there really no hope? And does this have anything to do with the game?? The questions are just as many as they are stupid and the answers are just as uncertain as what the future holds in its busom.
