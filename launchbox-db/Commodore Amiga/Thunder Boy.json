{"altername_name": [], "name": "Thunder Boy", "overview": "In Thunder Boy the player takes the role of Julian, whose girlfriend Jane was kidnapped by the fire dragon Drago. The reason: They rebelled when Drago took over their homeland. Julian's goal is to rescue Jane. This game is a side-scrolling platformer similar to Wonder Boy. The player walks from left to right while evading the enemies. Touching those drains Julian's life energy (reaching zero results in a life loss) - but so does starving. He has to pick up fruits to avoid this happening. Initially Julian can't attack the enemies, but after a while he finds an axe. The game features 20 levels.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Time Warp Productions", "publishers": "DigiTek", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/110005-thunder-boy\n"}
