{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dragon Cave", "overview": "\u2018Ere, these PD puzzlers are blimmin\u2019 good, aren\u2019t they? Dragon Cave is a mega-marvelous maze-based monster maul and for once it actually has a plot! Smaug the dragon has a problem. He needs (for reasons unspecified) to push his treasure chests into certain places within his caverns. Trouble is he\u2019s too big to wend his weary way through the maze of corridors that is his domain - why he\u2019s hiding his treasure in places he can\u2019t even get into isn\u2019t specified, but muggins (that\u2019s you) has volunteered to help. Set over umpteen single-screen levels, you must push the chests into the positions indicated. You can\u2019t push more than one chest or pull them at all, so it\u2019s very easy to slam one into a corner, making it irretrievable. Luckily there\u2019s an \u2018undo\u2019 option for just this situation. You get a choice of 2D or 3D perspectives - the latter looks far better but is all-but-useless when playing the game. There\u2019s a level editor too, so in the unlikely event of you completing the game\u2019s many levels, you can swap a few with your friends. There are no passwords, but you can pick your starting level. The heart of a game like Dragon Cave is its layout, and this one certainly isn\u2019t found lacking. An absolute rip-snorter and a bargain at PD prices - buy it!", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Bernstein Zirkel", "publishers": "Bernstein Zirkel", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnReEMWuuq4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/65017-dragon-cave\n"}
