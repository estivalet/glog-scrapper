{"altername_name": [], "name": "Jumpman Junior", "overview": "This version of Jumpan Junior was converted by Centauri Software for the Amiga, using elements from the Atari, Coleco and Commodore versions of the game but does not appear to have been an authorized port. As Jumpman, your goal is to disarm all of the bombs on the level before time runs out. Each level consists of a variety of platforms, ladders, and ropes you will need to jump and climb to reach the bombs. To make the game more challenging, a bullet will fire on the screen from time to time which will cause Jumpman to lose a life if hit. Each level has a different theme to it, and a few also have additional dangers as well. You will encounter deadly fires, the bouncing hellstones, moving ladders, disappearing platforms, and more.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Centauri Software", "publishers": "Courbois Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/131292-jumpman-junior\n"}
