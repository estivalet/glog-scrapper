{"altername_name": [], "name": "Super Delivery Boy: The Holiday Shift", "overview": "It's Holiday Season again and when it comes to deliver presents for good, Santa disappears like snow under the sun, so all the hard work is on the poor Super Delivery Boy. Help him deliver as many presents as possible so he doesn't get fired! But be careful, the kids have their own preference about what to receive and the path to reach them is full of wierd creatures. Pick up the presents by the color requested by the kids. Delivering the wrong one will give you less points! You can use non matching presents as weapon by tossing them against the enemies, but again, be careful with colors!", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "December 5, 2021", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "NeesoGames", "publishers": "itch.io", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161416-super-delivery-boy-the-holiday-shift\n"}
