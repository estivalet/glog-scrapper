{"altername_name": [], "name": "Aztec Challenge", "overview": "Aztec Challenge is an Action game and unofficial Amiga conversion of Aztec Challenge by Cosmi. It supports two players simultaneously, developed and published by Bignonia as a shareware, which was released in 1993. You have to steer your character through seven absolutely different levels. In every level new deadly perils lurk for the hero. The first is probably the most famous level. Left and right are some not exactly friendly meaning Aztecs, which welcome you with spears. You either have to duck under the spear or jump over it (depending on the height the spear is coming at). If you get hit you have to start again. In the later levels you have to avoid stones, poisonous scorpions and snakes and get over a bridge.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bignonia", "publishers": "Bignonia", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUzfPS0guaY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/61641-aztec-challenge\n"}
