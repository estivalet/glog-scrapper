{"altername_name": [], "name": "Wuzzi", "overview": "The game is composed of a board with two players (no AI is included), this makes game development even easier. The mission of the game is to defeat the other by getting the most winning point. The amounts of rounds are determined by the setting configured in the Option menu in the title screen. It is similar to the tic tac toe type game in one exception, instead of having to form 3 lines and it is X against O, you must form 5 lines and it blue player verses red player.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2006", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "FA Daye", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf_KihMvwlc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162522-wuzzi\n"}
