{"altername_name": [], "name": "Capone", "overview": "This is the first light-gun game for the Commodore Amiga. The action takes place in the Capone era of 1920s Chicago. The player is a lone gunman battling Capone\u2019s men down the streets and alleys of the city. The game plays much like Operation Wolf. As the game progresses, the screen scrolls sideways and evil gangsters pop up from behind windows and buildings. The player must take care not to hit innocent bystanders, including women, children, and pets strolling down the street. There are also two indoor scenes, including a warehouse filled with TNT and the finale that takes place inside a bank. Capone was released in the early years of the Amiga, and had a very unique look for its time.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Actionware", "publishers": "Actionware", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQ5Ryu5DWVY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/74110-capone\n"}
