{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dark Century", "overview": "You control a squad of high-tech tanks and you have to destroy the enemy squad. The tanks can move quickly, make sharp turns or fire in all the directions. The graphics in 3D are very well done for a 1990 game. Even if the game has a rather simplistic plot it can get quickly very addictive.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Titus France", "publishers": "Titus France", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75696-dark-century\n"}
