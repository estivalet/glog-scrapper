{"altername_name": ["Katakis"], "name": "Denaris", "overview": "Katakis on the Amiga is, like its counterpart on the C64, a shoot'em'up heavily influenced by R-Type. It's a single space ship versus the machine intelligences from the planet Katakis in six side-scrolling levels. The R-Type influence is apparent in many ways: from the design of the player's ship and some enemies to the weapons system and even some of the level designs (for example, one level is a battle against a giant enemy ship reminiscent of R-Type's third level). The player's ship is equipped with a standard forward-aiming weapon. Further powerups to be collected include a three-directional scattershot that can be upgraded from two to eight projectiles. A reflective laser bounces off the floors and ceiling to cause further damage. Also available is an autoseeker and a power shot which must be charged by holding on to the fire button. The R-Type influence on the weapons is most obvious with up to two protection satellites hovering above and below the ship, as well as the R-Ball, an indestructible object that can be docked to the front of the ship and be used as both a weapon and a shield (and thus is basically the same as R-Type's Force). The game offers a two-player mode, with two players taking turns. Katakis was withdrawn from sale shortly after release in Europe, in response to Activision's threat of legal action over its alleged infringement of their R-TYPE license. Subsequently, KATAKIS was renamed to DENARIS and re-released in 1989 with reworked levels.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Factor 5", "publishers": "Rainbow Arts Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.62", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katakis", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQXkjwOaFjM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/74243-denaris\n"}
