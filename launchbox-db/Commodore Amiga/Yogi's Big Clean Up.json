{"altername_name": [], "name": "Yogi's Big Clean Up", "overview": "This licensed game sees Yogi Bear doing something constructive. Across five levels, he must locate or repair eight key items. After clearing Jellystone Park of litter, he must go underwater to fix its water supply. He must then explore a swamp to fix Ranger Smith's bike, find misplaced objects in a film studio, and finally reassemble the bed within his cave. This takes place over platform-style levels, with lots of enemies to be avoided or shot, plus moving platforms and falls. He is armed with a bubble weapon, which is not required on the final level. Collecting pic-a-nic baskets will recharge Yogi's energy.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "PAL Developments", "publishers": "Hi-Tec Software Ltd.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.7", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/102622-yogis-big-clean-up\n"}
