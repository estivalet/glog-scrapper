Your mission is to give doom or deliverance to hundreds of tiny dot-like creatures called The Ants. Direct armies of hundreds of tiny ants with your mouse cursor and guide them in destroying food, obstacles, bigger insects or make them march to their doom. Attacking the enemies will reduce your ants fast while eating food will increase their numbers rapidly to the maximum of 100. Leave the ants alone and they'll start wandering around, eventually ending up killing themselves by walking into various deadly traps.You need to balance between each game element to get the insect and move on to the next level.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Scorpius", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/159624-ants-the-masses-against-the-massive\n"}
