{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sony Game", "overview": "Sony Game is a German-language promotional platformer game controlled with the keyboard or joystick, starring a grinning Sony Walkman with arms and legs. There are various patrolling monsters that you need to avoid, while also keeping your energy levels boosted and completing the level before the time limit runs out. The camera moves around the level in a \"flip-screen\" way, instead of scrolling. There is an in-game shop system for buying power-ups, and a password-based continue system.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Comad", "publishers": "Sony", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/131499-sony-game\n"}
