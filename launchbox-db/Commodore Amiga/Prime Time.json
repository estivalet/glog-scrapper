Prime Time from First Row Software lets you be the moron who cancels all of the intelligent but low-rated TV shows in favor of popular pseudo-dramatic tripe and identical sitcoms. Take on the duties of a TV network executive in this highly unusual simulation game. Pick the shows you want to air, from 160 regular programs and 15 network specials. Plan a schedule, recruit advertisers, bump shows around optimal time slots, but whatever you do, keep the ratings high if you want to keep your job.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "First Row", "publishers": "First Row", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72693-prime-time\n"}
