{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pink Panther", "overview": "The goal of the game is to help Pink Panther guide his sleepwalking employer through his house without waking him up. To help you in this, Panther can use various items, such as a little bell, which he can use to attract the sleeping man. The game is a sidescrolling adventure and takes mostly place in the house of the employer. Pink Panther himself can move freely in the house, but at the same time he needs to keep his eye on the sleepwalker, so that he can prevent him from stumbling on various objects, such as rugs and tables. Before each level you can purchase different kind of objects from a store. These items can be used to gently lure the sleeping man in the right path.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "reLINE Software", "publishers": "Gremlin Graphics Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.62", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/80328-pink-panther\n"}
