{"altername_name": ["Polataa 4"], "name": "Polataa IV", "overview": "The fourth in the series of bat and ball brick breakers. This NC Gamez game version is still different from the others because the racket that allows you to throw and recover the balls is double: there is one on each side of the screen, one on the right and the other on the left. There are small bonuses/penalties that fall when certain bricks are destroyed (slowdown, laser, multiball, next level, etc.). To increase the difficulty, Polataa has bricks on which you have to tap two or three times to make them disappear. On the production side, the game has beautiful graphics (the bricks are quite big), the sound effects are well chosen and the music is catchy. The game comes with a level editor that will allow, in an extremely simple way, to create new tables.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "NC.
