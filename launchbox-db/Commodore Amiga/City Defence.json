{"altername_name": [], "name": "City Defence", "overview": "City Defence is an early Missile Command clone. Your job is to defend several cities against deadly rays (instructions) from outer space. Missiles are fired with the mouse, which allows precise control. When they explode, they take along everything with it in a certain radius. The main goal is preventing the aliens from defeating the cities at the bottom of the screen, but extra points are scored for taking out the alien ships.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Diamond Software", "publishers": "Kingsoft", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/85581-city-defence\n"}
