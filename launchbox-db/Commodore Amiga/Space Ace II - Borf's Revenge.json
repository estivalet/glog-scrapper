{"altername_name": [], "name": "Space Ace II: Borf's Revenge", "overview": "You might be surprised to note that despite coming on five disks, Space Ace II only really gives you about four sequences of action, which are then subdivided into the tiny little blow-by-blow segments or scenes which you actually play. This, coupled with the tendency of the animations and samples to be cut off abruptly, gives the game a very bitty feel. Secondly, it's lazy. The same death sequences are used repeatedly, even in very different scenarios. Game looks pretty, and it's moderately entertaining for about the first 3 minutes but you will finish it inside three hours (absolute maximum) and you'll hate it so much by the end that you'll never want to see it again.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "ReadySoft Incorporated", "publishers": "Empire Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbBok3J1_Ko", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73091-space-ace-ii-borfs-revenge\n"}
