{"altername_name": [], "name": "Jimmy White's 'Whirlwind' Snooker", "overview": "A 3D snooker simulator. The table and cue can be turned through almost any angle, with shot strength and spin as required too. An on-screen dotted white line shows the path of your ball, including the next bounce. There is also a \"trick-shot\" mode, allowing you to recreate classic snooker trick shots (well, not the one with the basket. Or with the cues lying on the table. Or the one with the girl lying on her back with the pink ball in her mouth. But you know).", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "September 1, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Archer MacLean", "publishers": "Virgin", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.05", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_White%27s_%27Whirlwind%27_Snooker", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pr3IsnqxGs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40375-jimmy-whites-whirlwind-snooker\n"}
