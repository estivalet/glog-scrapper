{"altername_name": [], "name": "SnakeMan", "overview": "Snakeman is a public domain Oil's Well style game. The idea is to extend a snake down into a maze to collect 'dots'. The body of the snake extends into the maze, and this can't be crossed over, however you may retract the snake in order to take a different route through the maze or to avoid enemies. Should an enemy make contact with your snake, you lose a life. A level is cleared by collecting all the dots in it. Bonus items are scattered around the levels, which reward the player with extra time, points or lives if collected. Snakeman was programmed in the AMOS programming language.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "September 9, 1995", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Edwin de Koning", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tLE04IBQlo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164968-snakeman\n"}
