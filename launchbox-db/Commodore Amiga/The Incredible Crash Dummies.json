{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Incredible Crash Dummies", "overview": "At a time when computer games were being blamed for violence, bad language, epilepsy and everything else the \u2018moral majority\u2019 needed a scapegoat for, Virgin gave us: The Road Safety Game. Or not, as this is a standard platform game with a twist of questionable taste and purpose. You play a crash test dummy, trying to progress through levels filled with hazards such as cars and fireballs, within the time limits. Contact with each of these loses you a limb, and once you have none left, contact means game over. Since the character isn\u2019t handicapped by missing limbs in any way, in practical terms you can think of these as hit points especially as there are screwdrivers to pick up which restore one limb.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Gray Matter", "publishers": "Acclaim Entertainment", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.2", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Incredible_Crash_Dummies_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/91758-the-incredible-crash-dummies\n"}
