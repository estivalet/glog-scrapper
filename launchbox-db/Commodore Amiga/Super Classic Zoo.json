{"altername_name": [], "name": "Super Classic Zoo", "overview": "Based on a reconstruction of the original Super ZZT code from Epic Megagames, this Amiga version of the classic ASCII text. Super ClassicZoo is a fork of ZZT by Adrian \u201casie\u201d Siekierka based on ClassicZoo. Its goal is to improve the Super ZZT experience while sticking close to the original engine's feel and keeping full compatibility. It was later merged into ClassicZoo 4.30+. The game consists of several playable worlds. The gameplay is simple, with the player controlling a white on blue smiley face that can move and shoot in four directions and solve puzzles. Even at the time of its release, ZZT was a technologically simple game using text graphics and simple sounds, , but its limitations served to fuel creativity and an impressive amount of users went on to create their own ZZT worlds using various available ZZT editors.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2021", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Adrian \u201casie\u201d Siekierka", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/370994-super-classic-zoo\n"}
