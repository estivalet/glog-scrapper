{"altername_name": ["No Greater Glory: The Civil War"], "name": "No Greater Glory: The American Civil War", "overview": "The game is an actual re-enactment of the American civil war and you play part of either Abraham Lincoln or Jefferson Davis. You have to undertake all the strategic, political and economic decisions that will determine the fate of the American people for years to come, and victory is dependent on how well you utilise these skills in relation to the available resources. The main gameplay consists of a series of turns, with each turn representing a season or four months. These turns are subdivided into phases in which all activities of a given type are conducted and resolved. Summary screens show how you are progressing and mark out the important changes that have been made. Quite honestly, I can't see many people wanting to play this game for more than two hours as it lacks any flair or lastability. The graphics are very bland and the game stays completely mute while you are playing. A piece of music or even the odd sound effect would have added some character. Everything you see is text and icons and no attempt has been made to add variation to the game system. A two player mode would have been a good idea and would have given the game more depth. I don't think the majority of advanced strategists, let alone the average games player, are going to find this game easy or enjoyable to play.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Strategic Simulations", "publishers": "Strategic Simulations", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Greater_Glory:_The_American_Civil_War", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72565-no-greater-glory-the-american-civil-war\n"}
