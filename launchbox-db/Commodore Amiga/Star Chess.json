{"altername_name": [], "name": "Star Chess", "overview": "Star Chess is a German language board game, developed and published by Media GmbH, which was released in Europe in 1995. The chess program with new ideas! StarChess not only uses the classic methods to calculate a move, but also uses new methods that are constantly being further developed. StarChess has particular strengths, especially in the positional STARI game. It's not just a \"tactical piece-swapping program,\" but strives to use a good positional tactics to achieve the most promising possible endgame situation. Because more than 90% of all chess games are decided in the endgame phase, when there are only very few pieces left on the board attention was paid to modularity, especially in the opening phase. The opening library can be expanded almost limitlessly without having to replace the entire program. So you can easily add new libraries or remove existing ones. Therefore, special opening archives will follow in the near future. The first additional library to appear will deal in great detail with the \"English\" and the \"Morra Gambit\" opening. And that's very simple: copy the opening file into the \"Moduls\" drawer, and that's it! The program includes the opening automatically. But even in the basic version, StarChess already has a good knowledge of openings.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Manfred Leidorf", "publishers": "media GmbH", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164656-star-chess\n"}
