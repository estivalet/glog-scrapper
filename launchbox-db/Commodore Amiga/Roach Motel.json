{"altername_name": [], "name": "Roach Motel", "overview": "Roach Motel is a 1993 Amiga public domain platforming game, most notable to me as the very last game to work on my Amiga in the late 1990's, before it was put away for several years. There are around seventeen levels, any of which can be selected from the main menu. You play as a funky looking character, with some mighty special teeth. Your main goal is to grab all of the spray paint cans scattered randomly throughout the levels, while avoiding or crushing the roaches which will spawn and disappear in an endless fashion. Similar to Ghosts and Goblins, these enemies have no issues spawning directly below you, causing some cheap deaths.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ryan Scott", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162149-roach-motel\n"}
