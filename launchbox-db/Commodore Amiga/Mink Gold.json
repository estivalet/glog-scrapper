{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mink Gold", "overview": "In Mink Gold, you collect golden balls in a maze while avoiding ghosts. You don't need to collect all golden balls, just enough to make a green key in the maze magically turn into a red key. You have to pick up this red key and exit via the door before the timer on the right side of the screen (lifted from North & South) runs out. Because you get only one life, beating all 16 levels is difficult.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2014", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Amos Fan", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_K07Ac0vME", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164268-mink-gold\n"}
