{"altername_name": ["Ferrari Formula One: Grand Prix Racing Simulation"], "name": "Ferrari Formula One", "overview": "With the full support of Scuderia Ferrari, Formula One racing was recreated in detail in this simulation, with the top drivers and teams of 1986 to compete against for the most successful F1 team of all. Your job does not start at the racetrack; perfecting the car at the Maranello factory, in the wind tunnel to sort aerodynamics, and at the test track of Fiorano, is all required to get the most competitive car you can. You can jump straight into the races however, either as one-offs or a full championship season. Races can last from 18 km to the full 300+km distance, with all the practice and qualifying sessions. Car setup at the track involves selecting wing settings, tire compounds, fuel usage (important in the days of turbocharged engines) and the like. The action is viewed from inside the cockpit, with rearview mirrors to help prevent collisions.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Electronic Arts", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAtlrGpARHA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/85934-ferrari-formula-one\n"}
