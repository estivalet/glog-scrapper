{"altername_name": [], "name": "Kampfgruppe", "overview": "A platoon-level tactical game of armored warfare that encompasses almost all ground weapons used on the Russian Front from 1941-45. The Game puts the player in command of either a German or Russian battle group. Kampfgruppe provides four historical and an infinite number of randomly created scenarios. The game will automatically end after 20 turns (30 if there is an assault battle being played). However a game may be ended earlier or continue after it has ended if all sides agree. At the end of the game victory points will be awarded which will determine whether the battle was a draw or a marginal, substantive or decisive victory.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Strategic Simulations", "publishers": "Strategic Simulations", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kampfgruppe_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72158-kampfgruppe\n"}
