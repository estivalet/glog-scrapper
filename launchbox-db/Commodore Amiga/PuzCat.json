{"altername_name": [], "name": "PuzCat", "overview": "Game deliberately made in the style of an 8-bit game, for some imaginary 8-bit machine. Except the music, which was a placeholder for some suitably bleepy chip tune. The aim of this game while playing as a Cat is to eat all the mice in a level before moving onto the next through each exit door. Be careful though as throughout each level there are dogs that if touched will kill you and you will lose a life. However PuzCat isn't weak and can push blocks to squash the dogs or enable you to jump over them when properly placed.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2015", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Amy Worthington", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OemZ-PcLHws", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162026-puzcat\n"}
