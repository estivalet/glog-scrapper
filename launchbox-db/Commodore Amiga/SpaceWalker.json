Set in deep space in a time of great spaceships and computer controlled robots. You are part of a crew that salvages old ships and find something strange and send in a little probe to go through the labyrinthine hulk and you must scan it all, find the diskettes that give info on the cargo and batteries to keep yourself powered up. Watch out for traps and danger. Some white boxes need energy and will drain yours if you touch them. There is also a time limit per area so work quickly.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Roy Schneider", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3wY7SrBF8Y", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162613-spacewalker\n"}
