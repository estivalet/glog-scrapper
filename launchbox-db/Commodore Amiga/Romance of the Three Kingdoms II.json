{"altername_name": [], "name": "Romance of the Three Kingdoms II", "overview": "The sequel to KOEI's excellent Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a somewhat inferior game. As opposed to a balanced gameplay of the first game which requires you to use both strategic and tactical prowess to win, RtK 2 makes winning much easier with brute force. Once you have a sizeable number of troops and good generals, you basically win the game. Despite the lack of strategic depth and tactics and a seemingly dumber computer AI, RtK 2 is still an immensely enjoyable game that might appeal to anyone looking for an easy game of conquest, but will disappoint veteran RtK commanders looking for a tougher challenge.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Koei", "publishers": "Koei", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "12", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_of_the_Three_Kingdoms_II", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72888-romance-of-the-three-kingdoms-ii\n"}
