{"altername_name": [], "name": "Fast Freddie", "overview": "You control Freddie as you work your way up and down from one floor to another using only ladders and his own two feet. He needs to capture all of the floating hearts that he can without being tripped up by the Sneakers. Freddie has four levels to ambulate, and lots of Sneakers to hop over, before he's able to take on the biggest Sneaker of all (High-Top). The tenth and last prize awaits Freddie just over the head of High-Top. Once Freddie has that prize, he earns bonus points and gets a new screen to try.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Courbois", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/91264-fast-freddie\n"}
