{"altername_name": ["Mighty Bomb Jack"], "name": "Mighty BombJack", "overview": "Mighty Bomb Jack was ported to the Amiga, Atari ST and Commodore 64 from the 1988 NES games and is a sequel to the 1984 game Bomb Jack. Each level is split into two parts; an action zone and a Royal Palace room. The mechanics and level designs of the Royal Palace rooms are directly lifted from Bomb Jack. Action zones can be split up into several portions, and contain power-ups usually hidden in treasure chests such as money bags, Mighty Coins and Mighty Drinks. Mighty Coins allow Jack to change colors; blue allows Jack to open orange treasure chests, orange allows him to open any treasure chest by simply touching it from the side, and green transforms all enemies on the screen into coins for 5 seconds. Mighty Drinks add 10 seconds to the game's timer. Secret passages can also be found in the action zones, activated by finding a Sphinx in a visible or hidden treasure chest.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tecmo", "publishers": "Elite Systems", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.33", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mighty_Bomb_Jack", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7itipOGMXkA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75839-mighty-bombjack\n"}
