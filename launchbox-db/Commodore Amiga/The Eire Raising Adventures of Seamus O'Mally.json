{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Eire Raising Adventures of Seamus O'Mally", "overview": "Seamus was a rather simple feller, who enjoyed a Guiness, but then who doesn't? And a larf and a joke with his mates, followed by a Guiness. He was also renowned for being rather difficult to wind up or anger. Hopefully, by now, you've got a picture of a bloke that's as bright as a 5 watt light bulb and has the skin of a Rhino! That\u2019s our Seamus! But today was different as based on the evidence so far, and today Seamus would get angry, very angry, and you wont like him when he's angry. It all started rather routinely\u2026 A gentle hike down to his local, \u2018The Four Leafed Clover\u2019, and on his way he'd pick up a rag, \u2018The Irish Sun\u2019 from the newsvender.
