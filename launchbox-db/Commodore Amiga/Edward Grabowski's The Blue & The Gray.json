{"altername_name": ["Edward Grabowski's The Blue and the Gray"], "name": "Edward Grabowski's The Blue & The Gray", "overview": "Blue And the Gray is a Strategy game, developed by Edward Grabowski Communications Ltd and published by Impressions Games, which was released in Europe in 1994. A game based on the American Civil War, eh? I'll tell you this for nothing, it won't catch over here. Jumping straight into the Gone With The Wind era isn't the most engaging of subjects for us 'limeys' to bother with, preferring as we do to mess with our own history rather than someone else's. Edward Grabowski may not be the most familiar name on this 'side of the pond', but Stateside he's renowned from Baltimore to Yazzo County for his Micro Miniatures wargame system. The initial stages of forming armies and planning strategies on the big ol' American map, checking on resources and second-guessing the enemy is both engrossing and friendly to use. So why is it bad? Userunfriendliness is the plain and simple answer. Graphically it is not so hot either but that's never really been a problem as far as wargames are concerned. Graphics aside, the Micro Miniatures system is one that seems to have been designed with the artificial intelligence factor at the top of its list of priorities \u2013 while decent control has taken a back seat. Issuing orders, strategic battle methods and realism aren't this game's strong points: You can tell everyone, a particular group or a single unit to go to a set position on screen and then engage the enemy, but little else. The Blue And The Gray needs a more usable battle interface. One that allows for all sorts of situations and events. Without it, it's a hollow fight.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Edward Grabowski Communications", "publishers": "Impressions Games", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/61713-edward-grabowskis-the-blue-the-gray\n"}
