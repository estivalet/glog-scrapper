{"altername_name": [], "name": "Conflict: Europe", "overview": "Essentially an update of 8-bit game Theatre Europe, your task is again to play World War 3 scenarios fighting as NATO vs the Warsaw Pact. The game uses pretty basic handling. While you can access some menus as the bottom of the screen you can see the map on the main part of the screen where each unit is indicated as small square. Your aim, of course, is to eliminate all the enemy units. Some special actions can be selected, like deploying special units, attack with chemical weapons or even nuclear ones.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Personal Software Services", "publishers": "Personal Software Services", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73898-conflict-europe\n"}
