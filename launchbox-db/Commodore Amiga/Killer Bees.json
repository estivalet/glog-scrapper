{"altername_name": [], "name": "Killer Bees", "overview": "The aim is to sting all the people until they die, while avoiding good bees who will kill us. This simple mechanic gets very quick by level 5, and after level 5 things become frantic and crazy mayhem. A very easy game to understand and play, and fun for those who prefer gameplay over graphics. A great conversion/port of the Odyssey2 game of the same name.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2017", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gary James", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuAhn8CNj28", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162010-killer-bees\n"}
