{"altername_name": [], "name": "Soko Ban", "overview": "Freeware game released on an Amiga Power Cover disk (Issue #37, May 1994). But better play the improved shareware version Push 'n' Shove. The levels in both this and Push 'n' Shove, are very easy compared to the levels in the original version from 1981/1982. The levels in this one are easy compared to most Sokoban games. This game is not that bad, but it could be better with a relaxing tune. There are no ending screen and the high score table does not let you input your name.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "May 2, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Frentic Software", "publishers": "Amiga Power", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtkjZoiWMo0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161963-soko-ban\n"}
