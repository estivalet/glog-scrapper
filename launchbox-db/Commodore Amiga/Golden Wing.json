The aliens of The Xenon system have returned with their army of attack starships and have caused distortions in the asteroid belt. This caused a chain reaction of meteors swarming throughout the solar system, a danger for moons and planets. You, our fearless hero Jason Crusher and your Golden Wing ship must defend the entire solar system from this invasion, you are the only one left, our last hope.
