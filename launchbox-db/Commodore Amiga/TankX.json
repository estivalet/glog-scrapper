{"altername_name": [], "name": "TankX", "overview": "A remake of the famous Tankkk, renamed to TankX and updated (after 27 years). This new version has been updated after a slight *cough* delay. It is now called TankX, and supports 7 simultaneous players (up from 4). Many other improvements have been made as well. This version was developed in co-operation with the https://www.amigalive.com discord-community, who provided improvements ideas, testing, new battlefields and in-game music. Cheers! The original version was called Tankkk, where the number of k-letters denoted the amount of tanks in the game. This one should then be called Tankkkkkkk, but that would be silly. So up to 7 simultaneous players possible! - Tank #5 with a third set of keys which default to: U, T, 6, Y, F. - Tanks #6 and #7 with a parallel port joystick adapter.
