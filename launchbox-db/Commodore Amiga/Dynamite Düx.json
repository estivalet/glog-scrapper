{"altername_name": ["Dynamite D\u00fcx", "Dynamite Dux"], "name": "Dynamite D\u00fcx", "overview": "Bin and Pin, the Dynamite Dux, are playing a sweet innocent kiddies\u2019 game with their friend Lucy when the evil Achacha The Great (the great what?) materialises from nowhere and kidnaps Lucy! Argh! Shock! Horror! The heroic, daring dux take off after them immediately. There are six levels to fight through before they can get down to the serious business of rescuing their friend. Eighteen different types of creature oppose them, ranging from the Sumo Pig to the Boxing Crocodile! A great two-player mode is included: you can beat each other up if the action dies down temporarily! Bonus levels have been included to boost the content that bit more and, naturally, every level has a huge fat mega-nasty just make sure things do not get too easy. Playing Dynamite Dux is rather like watching a cartoon; the graphics are bold and bright, and the tune that plays throughout is the sort of bouncy jolly stuff that generally accompanies cartoons. Visually and sonically, it is a very enjoyable game. Disappointingly, despite the light-hearted nature of the game\u2019s presentation, it lacks an essential element of addictiveness. Though quite playable, it is a bit easy to get through the first couple of levels, and as a result, they become quite tedious when you play through them again and again. Lastability rating, therefore is fairly low. It is an accurate conversion; unfortunately, though, the original was not all that hot.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Core Design", "publishers": "Activision", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.62", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamite_D%C3%BCx", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyJ4bsNNW-g", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/9220-dynamite-dux\n"}
