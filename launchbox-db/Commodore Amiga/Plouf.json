{"altername_name": [], "name": "Plouf", "overview": "It is a top-down game where players sit on floats, trying to sink the other players by throwing sea urchins at them. \"Plouf!\" is the French onomatopoeia for the sound made by an object when it falls into a liquid. You control your float like an RC car: you can accelerate, slow down and rotate left or right. The islands on the screen are randomly generated, so each game looks different.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2013", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Aurelien Gateaux", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "3", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162016-plouf\n"}
