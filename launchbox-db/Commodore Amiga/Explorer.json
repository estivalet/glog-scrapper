His goal is to collect all the gold pieces on the board before the time runs out. To do so the player must appropriately push the crates blocking the road, use teleporters and generators of matter forming bridges over the abyss. Some of the fields are mined or marked as non-stopping area (requires two blocking crates next to it to remove the effect). The remaining time after the completion of the board is rewarded with additional points. The game features 60 levels all together. After each completed board the player receives a password.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "ASF", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/91081-explorer\n"}
