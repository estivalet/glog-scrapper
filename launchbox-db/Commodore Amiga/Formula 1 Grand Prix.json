{"altername_name": [], "name": "Formula 1 Grand Prix", "overview": "A simple arcade game, where you have to test your skills with F1 cars. The sound effect consist of the now standard engine drone and the 'kaboom' as two cars collide and, on the whole, they are sufficient. Some of the graphics are well presented, the scrolling background is used well and changes with every track. The track itself, however, is patterned with dark and light shades of gray and can be very off-putting. Overall, Formula 1 Grand Prix is something and nothing. It is by no means an outstanding game but it may be worth a viewing.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Cirrus Software", "publishers": "Microvalue", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/91408-formula-1-grand-prix\n"}
