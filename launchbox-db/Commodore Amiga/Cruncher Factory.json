{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cruncher Factory", "overview": "Cruncher Factory is a Pac-Man variant. The player commands a cruncher (which looks exactly like Pac-Man) and steers him through non-scrolling labyrinths shown from the side. On every place not occupied with a wall are pills which have to be eaten by rolling over the field they are on. There are also ghosts which cause the player to lose a life when touched - at least until the cruncher eats a special ball which causes him to eat the ghosts. A level is won when all balls are eaten. The game features 100 levels, a level editor (can be also used to change the existing levels) and a two-player mode.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "January 2, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Martin Aberle", "publishers": "Anco Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/9546-cruncher-factory\n"}
