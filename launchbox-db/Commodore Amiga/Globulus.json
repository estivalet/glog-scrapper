{"altername_name": [], "name": "Globulus", "overview": "In Globulus, the player takes the role of Globby, a alien who is on a dangerous journey. This is an action game with puzzle elements. Every of the 25 levels consists of tiles which are built like a mountain and the goal is to reach the bottom. It is important to think before jumping because the tiles have different abilities, e.g. spikes result in instant death or others cause an automatic movement from the player character.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Innerprise Software", "publishers": "Innerprise Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/mv6IyGMPZZc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/71936-globulus\n"}
