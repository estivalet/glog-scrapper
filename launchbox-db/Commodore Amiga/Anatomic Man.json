{"altername_name": [], "name": "Anatomic Man", "overview": "Anatomic Man is a vertically-scrolling shoot-'em-up where you control a shrunken-down spaceship flying around inside the human body, in a similar setup to the classic 1966 sci-fi film, Fantastic Voyage. As the game opens you see the tiny yellow ship fly into a wide-open human mouth, and the first level is down the gullet, where your enemies are food fragments that can damage the ship. Joystick controls are used to pilot the ship.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Accolade", "publishers": "Accolade", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/74418-anatomic-man\n"}
