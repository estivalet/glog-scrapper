{"altername_name": [], "name": "Captain Dynamo", "overview": "Insane genius Austen van Flyswatter has stolen a huge collection of diamonds, and retrieving them involves navigating a succession of fiendishly-designed arrangements of platforms and traps. Does that sound like a job for a retired superhero? Captain Dynamo thinks so, and aims to recapture them for their rightful owner. Gameplay is platform-based, with 12 (6 in Amiga version) vertically-scrolling levels, each containing around 50 diamonds - the more of these you can collect, the higher your score. Some will require advance planning to reach, while you will often be dependent on booster pads to reach the higher sections of a level.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "The Codemasters Software Company Limited", "publishers": "The Codemasters Software Company Limited", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Dynamo_%28video_game%29", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72311-captain-dynamo\n"}
