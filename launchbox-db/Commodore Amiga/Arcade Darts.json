{"altername_name": [], "name": "Arcade Darts", "overview": "Arcade Darts is for anyone who occasionaly fancies a game of darts but can't find either a dartboard or someone to play with. The player's hand is controlled with the mouse, although the player only has a certain amount of influence over its movement. The hand will drift around the board and it will take some practice to gain any real measure of control. This can be compensated by using more or less power and adjusting the release of the dart to cause it to fly to the left or right. Different game rules available are extensive and include 301/501, Mickey Mouse/Tactics, Shove Ha'penny, Round the Board, Killer and Shanghai. The games can be played either as a single game, challenge mode against all 16 opponents or in speed mode where you attempt to set a new best time.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Rob Massey", "publishers": "F1 Licenceware", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/159837-arcade-darts\n"}
