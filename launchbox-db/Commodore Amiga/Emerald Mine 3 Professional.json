{"altername_name": [], "name": "Emerald Mine 3 Professional", "overview": "Emerald Mine 3 Professional is a Boulder Dash variant and features no gameplay changes in comparison to its predecessor. The player's goal is to collect diamonds which are surrounded by dirt within a time limit. When walking over an dirt spot, it is cleared and an stone above it will fall down - with unhealthy results if the player or a monster is hit by it. Other items are dynamite to clear out boulders and keys for certain doors. The need to plan ahead and find out the required steps to reach the diamonds give the game a puzzle-solving character. Each player has to create a profile which is assigned a handicap (zero to eight), depending on the already solved levels. Each level has a difficulty level assigned to it and the player can freely choose levels which are equal or below the handicap. There are also additional levels for two players.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Klaus Heinz", "publishers": "Kingsoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90057-emerald-mine-3-professional\n"}
