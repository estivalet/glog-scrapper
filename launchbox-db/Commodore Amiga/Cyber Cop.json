{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cyber Cop", "overview": "Four levels, no bosses, gameplay consists of monotonous trekking as many as seven screens back and forth through a barrage of respawning enemies that follow you to other screens, lasers, mines, spikes, swinging maces and mine carts to get the ever increasing amount of pods. I have no idea how anyone can survive this without an invincibility cheat, which is probably what they did to make up for the fact the game is so short. There isn't even a final boss, or any in game ending. Graphics are nothing special, but when enemies start to appear on the screen the action immediately slows down. All in all a terrible game, period!", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Energize", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/89510-cyber-cop\n"}
