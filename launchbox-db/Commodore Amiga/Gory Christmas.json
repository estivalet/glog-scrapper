{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gory Christmas", "overview": "A Digital Ninja Christmas Special! A Christmas game for 2 to 4 players by Lee Bamber and released in 1994. This is not a violent game, nor is it horrific, terrifying, obscene, shocking or sickening. It's a game of the mind. If you are easily offended, the kids being sliced apart, crushed, kicked, thrown, maimed, stabbed and murdered are mere actors, playing a well-performed scene for your enjoyment. To the rest of us, it's a chance to release all those daily seasonal tensions. And for the minority who have no worries, it's a fast-paced, sadistic blood riot! Collect the grisly presents that Santa drops...and you can only hold 1 at a time...so you auto drop the one were holding when you pick up a new one. And know that Santa doesn't always drop the same pressies every round, so just keep collecting presents until you get the one you wanted.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Lee Bamber", "publishers": "Digital Ninja", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MUOjiMk4lI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/163863-gory-christmas\n"}
