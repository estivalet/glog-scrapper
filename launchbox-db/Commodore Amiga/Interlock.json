{"altername_name": [], "name": "Interlock", "overview": "In this game you control the grey ball, the object of the game is to connect all blocks of the same colour. In other words all the red blocks must be touching as must the blue green and yellow blocks. You may push one block at a time using the ball. Grey blocks cannot be moved and server only as an obstruction. Beware of holes, if your ball falls down one or you push a block into one, you will lose a life. In later screens you will encounter filters. A filter will only allow blocks of the same colour to pass over it. Each level is timed, if you run out of time you will lose a life. Time left at the end of each level is added to your score. You start with 3 lives and get a new one every 2000 points.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mark Mainwood", "publishers": "Software 2000", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXDLtvfzcIQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164036-interlock\n"}
