{"altername_name": [], "name": "Operation Desertstorm", "overview": "The game's creator advises players not to take this game seriously. I'm glad he/she put that warning in. You mow down a near-endless stream of Iraqi soldiers. In between levels, you execute helpless prisoners of war shackled to concrete slabs. None of the level graphics, sounds, or gameplay elements ever change. The game simply gets faster and faster the longer you play.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Spike", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDf5LhOGxEU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/368424-operation-desertstorm\n"}
