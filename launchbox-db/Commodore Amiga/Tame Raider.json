{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tame Raider", "overview": "This cool little 2D platform game is created with a game creator tool called Overbird. Which can be found on Aminet. The game is a pastiche of Tomb Raider, or at least presents itself as one. It features the busty heroine, Rhonda the Redhead as she progresses through levels beating up the aggressive men and other monsters she finds and kicking rocks out of her way, while squat thrusting to pick up treasures. The game has some simple puzzle and fighting elements.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Matt Kane", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mWEbeG-14c", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162038-tame-raider\n"}
