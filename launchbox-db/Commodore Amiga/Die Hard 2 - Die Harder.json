{"altername_name": [], "name": "Die Hard 2: Die Harder", "overview": "Die Hard 2: Die Harder is a Shooter game, developed by Tiertex Ltd and published by Grandslam Video Ltd, which was released in Europe in 1990. In the early 90\u2019s, two things just wouldn\u2019t die: Bruce Willis in the Die Hard trilogy of movies, and, well, 2D point-and-click shooters. Renowned software undertaker Grandslam was happily ready to dig the grave several inches deeper for both. The spade: a game called Die Hard 2: Die Harder. Based on the 1990 movie Die Hard 2, the program sends you through five stages modeled after key scenes of the film. As N.Y. cop John McClane, you have to shoot terrorists invading Washington\u2019s Dulles airport by quickly aiming a crosshair at them. You\u2019ll successively clear the luggage center, airport annexe and runway, then chase after the bad guys on a snowmobile and finally shoot it out on the wing of the terrorist\u2019s plane. Each stage consists of three screens; on the last one, several tougher bosses will appear. Occasionally, civilians cross the room and pray that you don\u2019t kill them. Most dying terrorists drop power-ups, namely med-kits, armor, grenades and weapons that are more powerful or fire faster. You collect these items by shooting them in time. If you do not aim fast enough, the terrorist\u2019s bullets will drain your health; you may die three times, but after that, John McClane bites the dust once and for all.
