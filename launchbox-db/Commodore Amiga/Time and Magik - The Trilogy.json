Despite the name \"trilogy\" these games do not share the same plot thread. Lords of Time has the best plot in this series: you must journey through time to collect various objects to defeat the Lord of Time. Red Moon and Price of Magik have more mundane plots, but the spell-related puzzles keep things interesting.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Level 9 Computing", "publishers": "Mandarin", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_and_Magik", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lt5ae6Drg7Y", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73637-time-and-magik-the-trilogy\n"}
