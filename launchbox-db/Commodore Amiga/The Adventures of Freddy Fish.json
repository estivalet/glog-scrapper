{"altername_name": ["Freddy Fish"], "name": "The Adventures of Freddy Fish", "overview": "King Triton will not let Freddy Fish marry his beautiful daughter Ariel until Freddy can afford the lifestyle a princess like her deserves. So Freddy begins an aquatic adventure to collect gold bars from the bottom of the ocean. You have to carry each bar individually up to the boat on the surface. In each of the sixteen levels, a host of enemies chase you. It is a simple and colorful game with lots of art assets lifted from James Pond. Chris Sorrell even gets a cheeky special thanks in the credits.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Chris Leathley", "publishers": "", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlxByaiXmkw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165118-the-adventures-of-freddy-fish\n"}
