Your task is simple: find the exit and flee.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Fabrizio Bazzo", "publishers": "Fabrizio Bazzo", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/89723-cyberdrone\n"}
