{"altername_name": [], "name": "Atoms!", "overview": "Atoms!, not to be confused with \"Atoms\" released the same year and dealing with the same game concept, is one of the many unofficial remakes of the 1984 type-in game Critical Mass. Players take turns to place an atom of their colour on the playing grid. When four atoms get together in a single square it will overload and blow outwards to the surrounding squares, overloading them and continuing the blast. When the atoms get blasted, they will change their color to that of the current player. Your goal is to wipe out all the other players' atoms before they do it to you.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tom Kuhn", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/160318-atoms\n"}
