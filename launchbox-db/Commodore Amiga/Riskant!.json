{"altername_name": [], "name": "Riskant!", "overview": "Just as the German version of this gameshow was based on the US Jeopardy game show, this 1993 video game appears to be based on the 1987 Jeopardy video game but with enough changes aside from the language to make it stand on its own. Three players compete against each other by coming up with the question for a given answer. There are two rounds of play each with six categories of answers, and one final round consisting of a single answer. Each correct question given can be worth from $100 to $1000 for the player to respond first, or if a daily double is uncovered the player to find it may bet up to the current amount of money they have. The player with the most money at the end wins. Jeopardy! features a high scores table so players can save their characters wins and losses, different male and female character animations to choose from, and of course a wide variety of answers and questions. Up to three human players can compete, or a combination of human and computer players.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "GameTek", "genres": "Quiz", "max_players": "3", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/131459-riskant\n"}
