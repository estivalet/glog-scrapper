So yes certainly a game that if you get the chance to buy it, you'll be pleased to have it in your collection!", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2021", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Safar Games", "publishers": "Safar Games", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mlzeGp4WC4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/169062-athanor-2-la-legende-des-hommes\n"}
