{"altername_name": [], "name": "King's Quest I: Quest for the Crown [Remake]", "overview": "Being fairly young in gaming years, to me Kings Quest I seems very basic especially by today\u2019s standards. But I\u2019m sure there are those of you out there who remember the good ol\u2019 days of RPGs, having to type in the commands for your hero, spending hours trying to find another word for \u2018walk\u2019 because your computer is having one of his pedantic days and waiting on eternity for each screen to load when your character moves from one area to another. Well, I bet some of the more nostalgic among you are now saying \u2018Hey, I remember those old classics\u2019 - and Kings Quest I is definitely one of them. The King of Daventry is on his last legs, and you, as his favourite Knight Sir Graham, need to retrieve three missing treasures to restore Daventry to its former glory and be rewarded with the crown. For your money you get some reasonable graphics, and some nice effects such as birds tweeting in the background, monsters splashing in the moat and waterfall. Controlling the game is relatively easy, type in whatever instruction you wish your character to carry out and the computer will either let you do this or suggest that you try something else. If you\u2019re a real RPG fan then it\u2019s worth a look. The game isn\u2019t too bad, but at the moment there are far more original and impressive adventure games around, and it can\u2019t compete with today\u2019s high standards.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Sierra On-Line", "publishers": "Sierra On-Line", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.67", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Quest_I", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuvgUfHP1cE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72178-kings-quest-i-quest-for-the-crown-remake\n"}
