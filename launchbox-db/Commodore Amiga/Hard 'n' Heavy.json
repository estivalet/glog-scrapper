{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hard 'n' Heavy", "overview": "Hard \u2018n\u2019 Heavy is a Platform game, developed by Rainbow Arts Software GmbH and published by reLINE, which was released in Europe in 1989. The game was originally developed as a sequel to The Great Giana Sisters but later was retooled to become Hard 'n' Heavy when Rainbow Arts faced legal troubles from Nintendo due to Giana\u2019s similarity to Super Mario Bros. Hard 'n' Heavy was a Giana Sisters clone on the C64. Later it was released on Amiga. It is a conversion, so not as good at the original version. The seemingly endless amount of stages that all look the same is what I remember about this game. The only thing that changes is the background colour. The graphics is almost the same, but the music is much worst.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Rainbow Arts Software", "publishers": "Reline Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.69", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhvG0hC5kA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/69284-hard-n-heavy\n"}
