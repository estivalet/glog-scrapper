{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cyber Assault", "overview": "Cyber Assault is a shooter, developed and published by Trojan, which was released in Europe in 1991. It was intended for use with a light gun but unlike some other Trojan titles, this one can either be played with a PHAZER light gun or with an ordinary Amiga mouse. In the 23rd century mankind has been forced to search the galaxy for mineral resources to survive. The U.E.F. Explorer, a massive automated reclamation vessel, has developed an error in the guidance computer and has selected Earth as the next target planet. Only you, Dexter Hartman, space adventurer, can board the Explorer and prevent it from coming home. Fight your way through the many ship levels, armed with your trusty Phazer, blasting rogue droids and aliens. Locate the ship's central computer and destroy it! This is the ultimate in high speed blasting action for your home computer.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "David Phillips", "publishers": "Trojan Products", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/85730-cyber-assault\n"}
