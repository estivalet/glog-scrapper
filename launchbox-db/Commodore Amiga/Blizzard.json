{"altername_name": [], "name": "Blizzard", "overview": "This was the Ottfried Schmidt's first and last commercial game. If you were a fan of Andrew Braybrook's classic Uridium, but were disappointed with the Amiga conversion, then Blizzard may well be for you. Although not quite as technically stunning as Uridium 2, Blizzard is a no-thrills shoot 'em up based very closely on Braybrook's C64 classic. The basic idea is to fly a small spacecraft across the surface of a large starcruiser, shooting alien ships as they fly by with guns blazing. Most fly in formation, making them very easy to kill, but look out for space mines and vertical sections of the starcruiser that just out into space \u2013 get hit by any of these obstructions and you are space dust (not to be confused with banned sweet).", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "", "developers": "Ottfried Schmidt", "publishers": "Crysys Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75066-blizzard\n"}
