{"altername_name": [], "name": "Space Rescue", "overview": "A Scramble-like space shooter game with coding, graphics & music by Tobias Eckert; helicopter drawn by Andreas Dubhorn. Originally sold as shareware, Space Rescue was re-released as freeware in 2017. Similar to the arcade classic Scramble, you pilot a spacecraft and navigate a gigantic cave system. Emphasis here is on memorizing the best route through obstacles and to the next refueling station. Space Rescue is an okay game for its age and can be completed in under 10 minutes if you have already perfected the levels.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Electralyte", "publishers": "Tomahawk", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kh7jPUIk4UI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161762-space-rescue\n"}
