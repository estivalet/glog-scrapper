{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Turtleminator", "overview": "Cannon Fodder clone with great support and an integrated level editor. A strategy shooter. You can shoot and throw grenades, and even fly around in helicopters and other things much later on. Make sure to get the latest version, earlier ones have a bug at level 3 that stops progression. I loved this, despite not being able to finish a specific level in which I was totally stumped on how to progress. The Turtleminator plays similar to Cannon Fodder, except you're limited to one player character. You and your enemies move faster. I think with a little more work on the graphics and with more levels, this could have easily been a commercial release. (note, the 1999 bug-fix edition had additional levels.)", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1998", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Monolith Designs", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm7wjhYw7Qg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161792-the-turtleminator\n"}
