{"altername_name": [], "name": "Chips", "overview": "A re-imagining of a game by Dr Hirudo, Chips is a challenging puzzler where you're trying to piece together a working Amiga computer by combining chips scattered all over the main board. Controls: Joystick/Arrow Keys to Move / Navigate Menus Fire/Enter to Punch / Select ESC to Show in-game menu / Speed up score bonus By standing next to a chip you can press Punch to send it flying in a straight line across the main board. Hitting a matching one will make it disappear. Stopping when finding a different one in its path. Look out! Chips (just like you) can move through the edges and reappear on the other side. If there's nothing in its path you'll get zapped! When the last two matching chips collide they change into a custom chip. You then have to combine them in a similar way to get a working Amiga.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2020", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Beta Mai", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF__4qHLU5w", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/163639-chips\n"}
