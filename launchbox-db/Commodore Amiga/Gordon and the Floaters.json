{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gordon and the Floaters", "overview": "Eric and the Floaters was the release title for the European port of Bomberman on MSX and ZX Spectrum in 1983. This game, however, doesn't play quite like the famous classic. You do have to blow up monsters, but they can't harm you. Instead, you lose a life when you used the last of the 20 bombs you get at the start of the game, or if you get hit by your own bomb blast. One of the monsters in each level is randomly given the key that you need to progress to next level. Originally released professionally as a \u00a39.99 title, it was later changed to public domain.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "September 9, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gordon Miller", "publishers": "", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89yp3NuDqDw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165320-gordon-and-the-floaters\n"}
