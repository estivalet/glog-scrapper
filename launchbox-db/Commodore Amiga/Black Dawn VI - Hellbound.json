{"altername_name": [], "name": "Black Dawn VI: Hellbound", "overview": "Black Dawn VI: Hellbound is the last and the greatest game in Black Dawn saga, developed by ZSoft and released by F1 Licenceware (coders Shaun Watters and Timothy Jon Gilbert) in 1995. The fun about this game is the fact that you see new things and have to try to suss out what they do. Objective of the game is pretty simple really.... Just kick the devils butt once and for all. Keep an eye out for the devils advocates (small dumply dudes in a cloak) as the can give you advice on how to overthrow their master (Not the most popular of bosses). You can talk to any creature that you are standing next to by clicking the TALK button. While talking with aliens you can buy and sell items or just get the latest gossip from the pits of hell. The whole Black Dawn saga is wonderful, very deep, with the dark atmosphere and with hundreds of weapons and items. Hellbound offers bigger main game window than it prequels, but your character settings options are more limited.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "ZSoft", "publishers": "F1 Licenceware", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dxlk_EuCoj0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75035-black-dawn-vi-hellbound\n"}
