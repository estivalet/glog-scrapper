{"altername_name": [], "name": "K c Munchkin", "overview": "A new port of (originally a Philips videopac / Odessey2 game) for the Amiga, released at Amigathon 2018. A top-down maze puzzle game with a concept similar to Pac-Man. The player controls a \"Munchkin\" whose goal is to eat all of the \"munchies\" on the screen, all the while being chased by three \"Munchers\" who are trying to eat him. By eating a glowing munchie, all of the Munchers will turn purple and can be hunted down for a limited time, successfully doing so results in a score bonus. Once a Muncher has been \"munched out\" (term used in the manual), it will return to the center of the maze to recharge for a short time before setting out for revenge once again. As players eat more and more munchies, the remaining munchies begin to move faster and faster around the maze. When there is only one left, it will be moving at the same speed as the player. You'll then have to hunt it down while avoiding the Munchers.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2018", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gary James", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHrGCvF8zhg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164102-k-c-munchkin\n"}
