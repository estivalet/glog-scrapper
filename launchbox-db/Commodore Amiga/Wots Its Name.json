The object of the game is to be the first one to reach the end of the board. You move around the board by giving the correct answer to the clues given. When the game starts you will be asked for the number of players (up to 4), and which question bank to use. There is currently 4 banks each with 50 question cards. On your turn, click on one of the available numbered circles and the corresponding clue will be shown. You must then enter an answer before the timer runs out or click on the PASS icon. The timer automatically stops when you press a key (see Notes below). There is NO penalty for an incorrect answer or for PASSing. Some of the numbered circles contain BONUS moves which move the player forward, or PENALTY moves which move the player backward. Theses are shown in the clue box and also have an appropriate sound. SCORING: The number of squares a player moves after giving a correct answer is equal to the number of clues remaining. For example, if you answer correctly on the 5th clue you will move 15 squares (20-5 = 15).
