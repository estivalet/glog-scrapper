{"altername_name": [], "name": "Jumpman Deluxe", "overview": "An AMOS based shareware Jumpman clone game created by Dreamware and published in 1996. The control has been altered to the point that Jumpman can turn around in mid-jump. The puzzles are different too - there are no bomb-triggered booby traps for example. The new time-triggered platforms are pretty cool. What's left is a pretty good Amiga platformer.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dreamware", "publishers": "Dreamware", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/370895-jumpman-deluxe\n"}
