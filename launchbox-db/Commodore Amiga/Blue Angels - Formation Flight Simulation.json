{"altername_name": [], "name": "Blue Angels: Formation Flight Simulation", "overview": "Although it is really a flight simulation, Blue Angels' focus on the exciting world of air shows makes it closer to a sports game than a flight sim. Instead of shooting downs MIGs or make bomb runs as in other flight sims, here you perform over 25 actual air show maneuvers with your famed acrobatic squadron the Blue Angels. Unfortunately the flight dynamics were almost non existent Overall, a fun game for flight sim beginners who aren't too concerned with realism in their games-- definitely not for ace pilots.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Artech Digital Entertainment", "publishers": "Accolade", "genres": "Flight Simulator", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75077-blue-angels-formation-flight-simulation\n"}
