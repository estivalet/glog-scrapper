{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sumera", "overview": "This addictive strategy game was found during excavations and is a forerunner of today's Backgammon with a specific appeal of its own. 1 or 2 player options available. Important hint from the manual (sort of copy protection): \"When starting the game for the first time, you have to make a choice between \"Computer-Human\" and \"Human-Human\" playing mode. This is done by getting the cursor's upper left edge to match exactly with the upper left edge of the chosen button, which will eventually spawn the corresponding request box shortly after.\"", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kingsoft", "publishers": "Kingsoft", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/128262-sumera\n"}
