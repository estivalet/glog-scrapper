{"altername_name": [], "name": "Thexder", "overview": "A platform shooter from Japan, Thexder offers many levels and diverse enemies that gradually increase in difficulty. You pilot a Battletech-style robot capable of switching from a mech into a jet at any time. Your weapon auto-aims, but uses up a fixed amount of rechargeable energy; if you run out of this energy, you'll have to wait a few seconds before you can fire again. Your mech also contains a shield that can be activated to protect you from harm, but this lasts for a few seconds and uses up some of your life energy.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "December 1, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Synergistic Software", "publishers": "Sierra On-Line", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.7", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thexder", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/91281-thexder\n"}
