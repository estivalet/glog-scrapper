{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Caffeine Free Diet", "overview": "The Caffeine Free Diet adds an original idea: gravitation. It affects your ship in both flying and aiming, so the game is quite difficult, but fun to play. While the graphics in the updated Assimilation: Caffeine 2 are almost identical, this version lacks the fantastic soundtrack by Ruben Monteiro. It makes the already great gameplay even more enjoyable. So if you had to decide between the two versions, I'd prefer the later one over The Caffeine Free Diet.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Fullspeed Creative Development", "publishers": "Fullspeed Creative Development", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/88797-the-caffeine-free-diet\n"}
