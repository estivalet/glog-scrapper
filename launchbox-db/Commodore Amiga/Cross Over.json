{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cross Over", "overview": "The aim of Cross Over is to collect all of the circles by moving your square over them and then moving the combined items to the nearest X. You must do all this within a given time limit. ON some level there are numbered tiles that can be used to help you reach normally impossible places, but be careful when you move these tiles as they can destroy each other. A 1 can hit a 2, 2 can hit a 3, 3 can hit a 4 a four can hit a 1.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "David Clark", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5KJ5tjDG-Q", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/163758-cross-over\n"}
