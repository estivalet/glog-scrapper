{"altername_name": [], "name": "Commando Raid", "overview": "Commando Raid is an autoscrolling shoot 'em up that looks and plays a bit like an Atari 2600 game. The screen moves downards as you try to navigate a maze of caverns with your helicopter. You have to replenish your fuel by shooting fuel tanks. There are also two types of cannons you have to avoid. The first shoots upwards, the second in a horizontal line. The game ends with a battle against a large attack helicopter. While your own little helicopter isn't animated, this boss has animated rotor blades and even explodes in fiery fashion if you manage to hit it often enough.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "William Nolan", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63Yqhl_bZ6I", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161937-commando-raid\n"}
