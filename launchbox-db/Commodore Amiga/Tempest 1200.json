{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tempest 1200", "overview": "This is an early DEMO of Tempest2000 for the Amiga, written by Elton Bird of Mental Software. Best played on a 28MHz or more A1200 with Fastmem. Lower spec. turn the fill OFF. I'm kind of stuck with what to do with it! If you have any interest in perhaps buying a finished version for a coverdisk, I'd be happy to hear any offers. Obviously the fact that it's an Atari game that's now out on PC and imminent on PSX/Saturn may be a problem for anything other than a PD release, but I think it's a little bit above being PD. Love to hear any feedback/suggestions. If you can, give me a ring and let me know what you think of it.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "", "developers": "Mental Software", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/370921-tempest-1200\n"}
