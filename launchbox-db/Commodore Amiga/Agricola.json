It as created by Alce programmers Baldassare Dante Profeta, gfx Giuseppe Stassi, Ignazio Stagnitta and sound by Filippo Vela. There are two versions of Agricola available for download. The ADF is an early demo with a menu and credits screen. The second version is an archive of files which can be run from hard disk. It seems to be a later release than the ADF demo. Run the appropriate file (Agricola_L1 for level 1, for example) to launch each level. The game was cancelled and while it was more than 80% done, when shopped around, it was never picked up for release by any of those companies looking.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Alce", "publishers": "", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zbi7c64LoY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165361-agricola\n"}
