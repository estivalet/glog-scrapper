{"altername_name": ["Sensible Massacre: England v Holland"], "name": "Sensible Massacre", "overview": "Putting the basic visual style from Sensible Soccer to a new use, Sensible Massacre sets you as an England goalkeeper faced with hordes of Dutch strikers running towards you (as a patriotic dig after the Dutch football team prevented the English one from qualifying for the 1994 World Cup). You are armed with an infinite supply of bombs, and must use these to kill the guys before they can reach the goal-line. They are aimed by using a crosshair controlled by the mouse, and fired with the left button. It's essentially Missile Command, so aiming the bombs slightly in front of where the players are at that moment, so as to allow for the time the bomb takes to explode and the distance the strikers can travel in that time. Bombs leave craters in the pitch, although these don't appear to affect the motion of the players, and is purely cosmetic. You can choose how long the game lasts, how fast the opposition is, and the color of the pitch. After the game, you are told how many players are 'home' (killed by you) and how many are 'away' (reached the goal-line successfully); the observant among you will notice the Cannon Fodder overlap.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "James Hall", "publishers": "Amiga Action", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161317-sensible-massacre\n"}
