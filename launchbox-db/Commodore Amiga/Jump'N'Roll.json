{"altername_name": [], "name": "Jump'N'Roll", "overview": "A remake of the Commodore 64 games Trailblazer and Cosmic Causeway, Jump \u2018N\u2019 Roll involves guiding a rendered spherical object through a succession of landscapes. There are theoretically more than 9 levels; I say \u201ctheoretically\u201d because the 9th one appears to be impossible. The landscapes are always 5 squares wide, and while many of these are just standard squares, there are several different types, differentiated by colour. There are black holes which cause the ball to drop, costing you valuable time, although you get a limited number of jumps on each level, which are accessed by pressing fire. Yellow squares speed the ball up, while red slows it down. Green causes the ball to stick and be immovable until it clears that section, purple reverses the left and right control, while blue gives a free jump (be careful not to miss the next jump pads while in the air though). Points are given depending on how far you progress in each level, and how quickly you complete it.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "D-Lite", "publishers": "CompuTec Verlag", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "http://www.mobygames.com/game/amiga/jump-n-roll", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/101312-jumpnroll\n"}
