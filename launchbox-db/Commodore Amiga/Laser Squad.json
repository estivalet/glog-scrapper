{"altername_name": [], "name": "Laser Squad", "overview": "In Laser Squad you control a group of space marine-like soldiers (and the occasional cyborg). Before taking them into battle (viewed from above and progressing in turns), you must buy them weapons and armour with a predetermined amount of credits, taking into account the individual abilities of your squad. Unlike X-COM, the soldiers do not gain experience over time. The game also features a two player hotseat multiplayer option.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "TeQue", "publishers": "MicroIllusions", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.83", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_Squad", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VT7N1IS_YeE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72256-laser-squad\n"}
