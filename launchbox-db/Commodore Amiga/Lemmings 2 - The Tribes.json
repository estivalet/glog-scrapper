{"altername_name": [], "name": "Lemmings 2: The Tribes", "overview": "The sequel to Lemmings has a plot describing how the Lemmings have split into 12 distinct tribes, each of which has their own landscape and their own cultural identity - they include Egyptian, Circus and Highland. However, Lemming Island is now in danger, and you must complete 10 levels for each tribe in order for them to reunite and reassemble the Talisman from the 12 pieces. Across the 120 levels there are over 60 skills, although no more than 10 are in use on each screen. The Classic tribe has the ones from the original and is perhaps the best option for first-time players.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "March 1, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "DMA Design", "publishers": "Psygnosis", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.29", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmings_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40984-lemmings-2-the-tribes\n"}
