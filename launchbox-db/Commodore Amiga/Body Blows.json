{"altername_name": [], "name": "Body Blows", "overview": "Around the time of the Amiga version of Street Fighter 2, Amiga specialists Team 17 came up with a similar one on one beat 'em up, designed around the machine's strengths and weaknesses. AGA version, released a year later, featured entirely redrawn backgrounds, doubled the playable characters and locations. In the 1993 version you had four characters to choose from - brothers Dan and Nik play identically, Lo-Ray is a Buddhist Monk, and Junior a failed boxer. The opponents include a Ninja warrior, a businessman whose post-fight catchphrase is 'I'm sorry about that', and a thin Spanish girl. The backdrops feature lots of color and animation, varying from wrestling rings to building sites and beaches. The 1994 release let you play any of the aforementioned characters. The control is designed around one-button controllers, with special moves generated by pushing in a certain direction and pressing fire, and one 'super special' move by holding fire for a few seconds. The real skill is in combining these moves effectively.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "March 1, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Team17 Software", "publishers": "Team17 Software", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.79", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_Blows", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40579-body-blows\n"}
