{"altername_name": [], "name": "Xiphos", "overview": "As usual, a computer has been put in control of vast stretches of an intergalactic empire. As usual, it has failed and locked the entire area into limbo. As usual, you're the one who has to sort this mess out, by reaching the computer and destroying it. Unfortunately, the area en route to it is vast and treacherous, with lots of obstacles to shoot out, and you will need to trade your items in order to get enough fuel to get there. The gameplay resembles Elite, involving first-person space shooting and trading.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Voodoo", "publishers": "Electronic Zoo", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/101367-xiphos\n"}
