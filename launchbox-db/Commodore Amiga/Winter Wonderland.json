{"altername_name": [], "name": "Winter Wonderland", "overview": "A text adventure game from Laura A. Knauth in 1999. The game got 1st place (out of 37) in the 5th Annual Interactive Fiction Competition that same year. Infocom-like game written with Inform with lots of good puzzles. It mostly takes place in a magical, positive winterland. Good writing and original puzzles are why this winter themed game did so well in the competition. You're a little girl concerned about your ailing brother, and you're heading into town to buy a candle so that your family will have something to put on its solstice tree--but you stumble into a fantasy world. Young Gretchen could have only imagined the fanciful events that were to occur before finding herself lost in a winter wonderland.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1999", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Laura A.
