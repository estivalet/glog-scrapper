{"altername_name": [], "name": "Super Pool", "overview": "A one or two player billiards style game created by Malcolm Bamber and released to PD in 1992, you will have no problems sinking balls as the felt will be full of them. Every space on the sides of the felt is covered with pockets, not just the usual six. The challenge is that you can never reuse a pocket and it is incredibly easy to accidentally put the cue ball into a pocket.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Malcolm Bamber", "publishers": "", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NaqYRCGl40", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164674-super-pool\n"}
