{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tunnels of Armageddon", "overview": "Tunnels of Armageddon is a fun futuristic racing game with a twist: instead of racing headlone on predetermined tracks, your goal is to collect various objects inside the tunnel by knocking them off the walls. There is not much else to the game, but although gameplay is simplistic, it is a lot of fun. You will need to avoid obstacles inside the tunnel, and there are many bonus items that increase your score. You will also come across forks or junctures inside the tunnel where you will have to choose which way to go. Lack of tournament mode and on-screen computer opponents hampers the game's replayability, but the availability of long, varied tracks should keep you busy for a while. Recommended as a fun diversion, not something you will labor months to finish.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "PZK", "publishers": "California Dreams", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnels_of_Armageddon", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yODPRY-2TQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73708-tunnels-of-armageddon\n"}
