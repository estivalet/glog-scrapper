{"altername_name": [], "name": "Zut Alors!", "overview": "A shareware adventure game from Brian Asbury, originally a Quilled adventure for ZX Spectrum, inspired by Games Workshop's En Guarde. The later Amiga version was written using Hatrack II and dates from 1991. The Amiga version was included on the Amiga Computing issue 43 (December 1991) coverdisk. Version 2.3 (from August 1994) fixes several serious bugs, such as issues with the drop/remove and save/load routines, as well as adds extra features. Zut Alors! is a text-only adventure in which you play the part of Cyrano de Bergerbar, a young blade recently arrived in Paris to seek his fortune. Cyrano has a burning ambition to join the King's Musketeers like his idols Athos, Porthos, Aramis and D'Artagnan, and, indeed, this is the object of the game. To win, you have to become a Musketeer. This is not as easy as it sounds, as you must firstly prove yourself in the ranks of lesser regiments.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Brian Asbury", "publishers": "Amiga Computing", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/372592-zut-alors\n"}
