{"altername_name": [], "name": "HotShots", "overview": "Some would call it a HotShot clone, the creator of the game, Chris Nash, said the game was created because of a little old Spectrum game of the name `HotShot'. I loved it so much that I wanted to play it again, but the old Spectrum is broken and I can't find it for the Amiga...so i wrote it. In one sentence I would describe HotShots as a cross between Pinball and Arkanoid. The idea is to get as many points per round by hitting the bricks at the top of the screen with the ball, and try to stop your opponent from doing the same, on there side of the screen. Just one ball for the two of you, and you can try to gain possession with your Graviton guns, pressing fire makes the gun pull at the ball, until it is stuck to the end ( You can only hold it for a limited time). You can then let go, and the ball shoots off in the direction your facing, hopefully hitting bricks for points. If the ball hits your character at any speed then you will loose a bit of energy, lose too much and your opponent wins.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1999", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Chris Nash", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=US68olmB8Wk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/167018-hotshots\n"}
