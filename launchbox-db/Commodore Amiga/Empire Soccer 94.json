{"altername_name": [], "name": "Empire Soccer 94", "overview": "Rather than copying Sensible Soccer or Kick Off, this football game features a number of comical and unrealistic touches. Although the view is top-down, the pitch is small and square, and the players appear huge on it. A range of moves including overhead kicks, trapping the ball and quick 1-2 passes can be mastered. Before each match your team can choose special moves to assign to each player - power shots with ludicrous curve, super dribbling (making the ball stick to your foot), and a Barge power to push players out of the way. A full world cup tournament is offered, which up to 8 human players can partake in, as well as single exhibition matches. The action replays feature a VCR-style control.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Graftgold", "publishers": "Empire Software", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "8", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90058-empire-soccer-94\n"}
