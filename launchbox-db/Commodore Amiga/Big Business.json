{"altername_name": [], "name": "Big Business", "overview": "Financial management games have been around since the dawn of home computers. It goes without saying that most of them consisted of little more than boring figures and statistics. So you can just imagine my delight when Big Business fell onto my desk. Up to three human or computer players can participate in the fun and each one begins the game with equal assets. It\u2019s then down to the individual to ensure that the company makes its fortune by the investment of money in research, development, production, advertising and most importantly, champagne! Humourous screens are used to display and control the action, you can control the game using either the mouse, joystick or your keyboard. Initially, Big Business is quite good fun and it really comes into its own in the multi-player mode. However, this is probably due to the humourous graphics, because after a while boredom sets in due to the repetitive nature of the gameplay. The high price is another stumbling block and it would have been better suited to the budget market.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Off The Wall Productions", "publishers": "Magic Bytes", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "3", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/71553-big-business\n"}
