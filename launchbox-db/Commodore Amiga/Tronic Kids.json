As noted by the developer this game was through the culmination of 8 months of intense work and is inspired by the classic game of Booby Kids which appeared on the Acades and the NES. In this game you must traverse each of the many screens to collect all the treasures which are scattered about the level to open up the doors to allow you to progress. Once that is done you can progress onto the next level and experience all 6 levels in the game to complete the game for good. Just be aware there are enemies about, that although can be avoided, you can also dig holes for them to fall in and be hopeful they disappear for good.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2018", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Amiga Factory", "publishers": "Amigatronics", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVh-Rrnuufc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162044-tronic-kids\n"}
