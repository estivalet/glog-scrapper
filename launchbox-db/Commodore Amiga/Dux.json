{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dux", "overview": "Dux is a simple shooting gallery game spiced up with a certain duck flavour, obviously inspired by UPL's Carnival. You have a gun mounted at the bottom of the screen. Above are three rows of targets moving around. The targets consist of rabbits, owls, duck and boxes with numbers. You move your gun left and right in order to hit the targets, and you earn more scores for hitting those on the higher rows. You have a limited amount of bullets, but hitting the numbered boxes add more to your arsenal. While the rabbits and owls require just one hit, the ducks will change colours several times before being eliminated. When only five targets remain, the screen changes colour and they must be hit before they leave the screen forever. As you progress, the speed is elevated.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Magnetic Fields", "publishers": "Gremlin Graphics Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/92743-dux\n"}
