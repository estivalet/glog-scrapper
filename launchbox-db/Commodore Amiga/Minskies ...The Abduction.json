{"altername_name": ["Minskies Furballs"], "name": "Minskies ...The Abduction", "overview": "Tetris fans \u2013 all your birthdays have come at once. And even if you are not a Tetris fan you will be one after a few bouts on this game. Minskies Furballs is one excellent Tetris clone. It is bright, it is colourful and it is easy to play. All you have got to do is manipulate the oncoming coloured blocks into matching groups of four or more. Each time you do this you send a fish symbol or little grey blocks down on your opponent's side mucking up their arrangements so they have got to get rid of them. As well as grouping your blocks together you have got a variety of weapons at your disposal. There are three offensive weapons and three defensive ones. A red bar at the bottom increases as you progress through the game and so does your weapon status. That gripe aside, control is easy enough, press down on the joystick to speed up the blocks, up to select weapons and left and right to move the blocks around. Likewise on the keyboard use left and cursor keys to move either way, right Amiga and right Alt to rotate the blocks. Minskies is totally addictive and great fun to play. The in-game tune and the little shouts of \"here we go\" and \"you're in trouble now\" add to the overall enjoyment. The only problem I have with it was that, at times, there did not seem to be much difference between easy, medium and hard mode.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Binary Emotions", "publishers": "Guildhall", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jv_xr0-ZVTI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72383-minskies-the-abduction\n"}
