{"altername_name": [], "name": "Vortex", "overview": "Vortex is an arcade-action game with colorful, abstract visuals that resemble molecules and galaxies, and a sci-fi backstory: an attempt to harness a new source of energy has torn a hole in the fabric of the universe, and our only hope is to re-seal it before it destroys everything. The game is controlled with the mouse and takes 1 or 2 players. The circular outer edge of the playfield is the deadly force wall. Your goal is to knock opponents into the force wall, destroying them, without being knocked into the force wall yourself. Some opponents come in clusters that need to be separated, before each component can be destroyed.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Visionary Design Technologies", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/115612-vortex\n"}
