{"altername_name": [], "name": "Roll-Out", "overview": "Something of a Pengo inspired game with really good title screen music. Roll-Out is a puzzle game that features a block pushing mechanic similar to Pengo. The game takes consists of one screen levels that are viewed from a top down perspective. On the screen there are various blocks that the player character (which is some sort of green little monster) can push (but not pull) and they will then move until they hit a solid object. Some of the blocks have smiley faces on them and the player's task is to push them onto hatch doors which will remove the blocks from the level. A level is completed once there are no more smilies on the screen. To make it all harder there are hostile creatures moving around that the player has to avoid touching since doing so will lead to a lost life. The enemies can be killed by pushing blocks over them but they will respawn after a while. There is also a time limit for each level.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Olaf Schneider", "publishers": "Procovision", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hpHuB1tBQo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161719-roll-out\n"}
