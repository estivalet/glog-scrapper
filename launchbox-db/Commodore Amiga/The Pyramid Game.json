{"altername_name": ["Pyramid Game"], "name": "The Pyramid Game", "overview": "Two versions of this puzzle game by William Martin exist, as shareware there is the demo version limited to one player against the computer and the full version that allows up to 4 players. Each pyramid has 4 colors, some can repeat. You must play each pyramid into the current game board so that it matches up to the pieces around it. This gets increasingly difficult as the board slowly fills with pieces, all needing to match up on all 4 sides.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "William Martin", "publishers": "William Martin", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164492-the-pyramid-game\n"}
