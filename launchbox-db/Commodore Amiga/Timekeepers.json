{"altername_name": [], "name": "Timekeepers", "overview": "Timekeepers is hybrid strategy and puzzle game. It plays like a cross between Lemmings and a RTS like Dune 2. The main game screen has a row of icons at the bottom, timekeepers' portraits at each side and at the center a scrolling map of the level. The platoon is autonomous, the player can't control it directly but instead has to place icons on the map to order the troops. A soldier will try to perform an action while passing over an icon.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Vulcan Software", "publishers": "Vulcan Software", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/lPF-bR43gvA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72005-timekeepers\n"}
