{"altername_name": [], "name": "Crunchman", "overview": "This feels like an updated version of the 1987 Pac-Man clone from 1987, this one was released in 1992 by Dave Baldwin and appears on the original Assassins disk. It has your normal dot gobbler, avoiding a similar quartet of ghosts. In this one the ghosts do not hesitate to follow through the tunnel and speed is somewhat variable. The sound effects are the only letdown in this, as they are strange and unrelated sound samples.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dave Baldwin", "publishers": "Sapphire", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLNDcPfFa7g", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162443-crunchman\n"}
