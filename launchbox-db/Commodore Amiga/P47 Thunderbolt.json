You are initially armed with a machine gun, but can also pick up bombs, spray missiles and multi-missiles by picking up the appropriate letter. Each weapon can be upgraded by picking up further tokens of the same type. Tokens offering extra lives and speed-ups are also on offer.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Source the Software House Ltd.", "publishers": "Firebird Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/24047-p47-thunderbolt\n"}
