Duckula thought, thinks the motion of the turret is a side effect of drinking Nanny's potion (understandable really), but he soon realises their true predicament when they hit an asteroid field. Fortunately, Tremendous Terence Count, Duckula's hero comes to the rescue, knocking their \u201cturret spacecraft\u201d on to a nearby planet surface. Oh dear though it's planet Cute \u2013 Yuk! Duckula hates cute things, and he soon realises that if he and his pals stay on this planet for any length of time, they too will become... Cute... aagghh! All the cuties dollies and teddybears want to give our pal a big wet kiss (Blah) to speed up the cuteness process. There's only one thing for it. Duckula, Igor and Nanny have got to get off this planet and quick, but they have lost the lightning conductor in the crash landing and they will need this to escape. Can Tremendous Terence help, will they get away, it's up to you.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "The Conversion Company", "publishers": "Alternative Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count_Duckula_2", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/89282-count-duckula-2-featuring-tremendous-terence\n"}
