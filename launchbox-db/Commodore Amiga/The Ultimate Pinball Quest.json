{"altername_name": ["Living Ball"], "name": "The Ultimate Pinball Quest", "overview": "The Ultimate Pinball Quest boasts of \"the largest pinball table ever created\", and can back it up with the 99-level table \"Wasteland\", along with two others of smaller size. While the level of quality may be higher in more traditional pinball games, the sheer size of the tables is quite impressive. The game features three modes. Adventure, in which the three tables are connected; arcade, which is the traditional style allowing you to select any of the three tables; and bonus, allowing you to play the six bonus stages. While the Arcade and Bonus modes require no explanation, the adventure mode does. It starts you out in the Wasteland, but has hidden links to both of the other tables, similar to the links to the bonus tables, but much less common. Also of note is the storyline that attempts to provide a background to the game.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Interactivision A/S", "publishers": "Infogrames Europe SA", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Pinball_Quest", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/121564-the-ultimate-pinball-quest\n"}
