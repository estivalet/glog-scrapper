{"altername_name": [], "name": "Doctor Strange 2: The Return of Dr. Strange", "overview": "Doctor Strange 2: The Return of Dr. Strange is a PD Platform game, developed in AMOS Professional by The Ouija Board, which was released in Europe in 1995. A level editor is included on the disk. The sequel to a PD game I used to love in my youth. This one takes on a different format altogether - its predecessor had single-screen levels much like Qwak, although the sprites were smaller allowing for larger levels, and involved control of the titular character capturing creatures with the aid of a pickaxe. This one features larger scrolling levels and requires you to shoot creatures instead.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "", "developers": "The Ouija Board", "publishers": "", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.1", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr5a_M-TZD8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/65036-doctor-strange-2-the-return-of-dr-strange\n"}
