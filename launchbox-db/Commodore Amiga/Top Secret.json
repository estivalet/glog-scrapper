{"altername_name": [], "name": "Top Secret", "overview": "Top Secret is a platform game played out on individual screens, each with a number of disks to collect. There are various enemies on the screen, which must be hit a number of times to be stopped. The ground-based creatures can then be walked over for points, while the birds simply stop for a few seconds. Your weapons have an arc similar to Kid Gloves, meaning that they hit the ground then rebound to a lower height, making precision aiming important. The level layouts are similar to Rodland, with gaps between platforms, and your character glides in a similar way - some of the disks are suspended in mid-air, and you must control the character's fall to pass over these - thankfully your character isn't harmed by falling. A number of bonus items are on offer, including extra points, extra lives and invincibility", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "The Hidden", "publishers": "Amiga Power", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUJe6oPBFRM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73674-top-secret\n"}
