Tron is an arcade side-scrolling fantasy beat-'em-up, a simplified clone of Golden Axe. As one of twin brothers the player must cross several lands defeating numerous legions of enemies to meet his relative in the final battle for the throne. Each level is divided into three stages. After the second stage an energy carrier appears, allowing to improve the health condition. The hero may derive three strokes - standard, in a kneeling position and aerial. Encountered enemies are divided into three groups: flying, walking and jumping, each with only one kind of attack. Some of defeated enemies leave a grey shield, which gives a temporary immortality. The game allows to choose one of two available background sets.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Domain Software", "publishers": "EXE", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6uvA_H8gts", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161801-miroslaw-kontra-slawomir-czyli-walka-o-tron\n"}
