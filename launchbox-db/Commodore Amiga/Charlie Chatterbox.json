{"altername_name": [], "name": "Charlie Chatterbox", "overview": "A shareware release where you must collect all the fruit, as in the Dugger game. Charlie Chatterbox is based on the old Spectrum game Splat! by Incentive Software the only major difference being that Splat! scrolled the screen in a semi-random way whereas 'Charlie' follows a set route. The idea is to eat as many of the apples as possible whilst avoiding getting trapped behind walls as the screen scrolls. The only way you can die is to be forced into one of the sides of the playing area. ** SHAREWARE ** This was released as shareware on the 17-Bit Software disk 3275.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gary O'Connor", "publishers": "17-Bit Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/371571-charlie-chatterbox\n"}
