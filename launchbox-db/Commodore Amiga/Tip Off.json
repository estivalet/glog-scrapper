{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tip Off", "overview": "After the success with Kick Off and its sequel, Anco tried their hand at basketball. This basketball game has like the Kick Off games a top down view and the action is quite pacey, a trademark for many football games of the day (Kick Off in particular). The teams in the game are British but you can edit them using the built-in utilities. The game also has a tactics designer and the option to change the kits of each team. You can play either single matches or a full league competition. Tip Off can be played by four players simultaneously, so can play co-op with a friend against the computer, or just compete against one or two other players.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Anco Software", "publishers": "Anco Software", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tip_Off", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/44972-tip-off\n"}
