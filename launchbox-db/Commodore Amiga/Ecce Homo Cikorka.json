{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ecce Homo Cikorka", "overview": "After the not-so-successful text adventures The Name Rose (1990) and Cesta Bojovn\u00edka (1991) , Kamil Bla\u017eek published another one, this time from the environment of a gypsy housing estate. As the hero Koudelka, we go there to rescue \"the unsurpassed programmer Kamil, who was kidnapped by gypsies because he didn't want to give them his Amiga\". The title of course refers to the Czech film Ecce homo Homolka (1969). As in the previous cases, this is essentially a choose your own adventure , where we are always presented with a situation and offered several options on how to proceed. We then choose from them using the letters A, B, C, while usually only one option is correct and the others mean death and the necessity to start from the beginning. The game is still extremely short , but at least there is a small shift when branching off in one place (we may or may not go to the pond after the children), so the passage is not strictly linear. The game was released as part of Amiga Wave in 1992.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kamil Blazek", "publishers": "Amiga Wave", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/372846-ecce-homo-cikorka\n"}
