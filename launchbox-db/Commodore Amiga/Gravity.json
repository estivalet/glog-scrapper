{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gravity", "overview": "Gravity is an isometric-perspective action game whose gameplay centers around maneuvering a spaceship around a three-dimensional isometric grid in an attempt to colonise planets. Centers of gravity create \"pits\" on that grid, which are the basic obstacles to maneuver around. An alien species called \"Outies\" plans on transforming all suns of the galaxy into black holes. They feed off raw energy, and as black holes are a good source of that, they attempt to create as many as possible of them. The player is sent out in a scout ship to colonise worlds in an attempt to gain resources to use for battling the Outies.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Image Works", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1R_Uttxg9Pc&feature=youtu.be&t=1m", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86265-gravity\n"}
