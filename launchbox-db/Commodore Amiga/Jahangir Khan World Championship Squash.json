{"altername_name": [], "name": "Jahangir Khan World Championship Squash", "overview": "Squash simulations are something of a rarity, and it was this nich\u00e9 that Krisalis aimed one of their many sports simulations into. The rules of squash are accurately recreated, with a realistic court layout (viewed isometrically) and a need to hit legal shots. Three different ball speeds, variable match lengths and an 'easy' mode are on offer. Different tournament types are on offer, at 'club' and 'tournament' levels, with a customisable ladder system of multiple divisions to rise up. There is a full roster of opponents to play in one-off or tournament modes.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Krisalis Software", "publishers": "Krisalis Software", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fz_lwtCsh0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73784-jahangir-khan-world-championship-squash\n"}
