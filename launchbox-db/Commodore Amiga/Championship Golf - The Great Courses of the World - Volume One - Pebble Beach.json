For every hit the game shows a 3D and overhead view of the situation, so the player can plan the next steps accordingly. The golf game itself is menu driven: the player changes various parameters, e.g. the golf club, the direction, the golfer's position, the strength and if the ball is hit in the middle or an outer edge. According to those parameters the game calculates the hit, which even may result in a straight miss, and then the next planning phase starts. The player may play a championship with all 18 holes or a training round with a single hole.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Interplay Productions", "publishers": "GameStar", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/85392-championship-golf-the-great-courses-of-the-world-volume-one-pebble-beach\n"}
