{"altername_name": [], "name": "Touring Car Racer", "overview": "This game offers a simulation of the popular British Touring Car Championship of the early 90s. Four different cars are featured, from Toyota, BMW, Nissan and Vauxhall, which make up the 24-car grid. The game features accurate re-creations of Brands Hatch, Silverstone, Donington Park and Oulton Park. You can practice each track, or do single races or championships, over 3,5 or 7 laps, although you always start 10th on the grid with no qualifying. The race is viewed from above and behind your car, similarly to the Lotus Challenge series.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Cloud Nine Developments", "publishers": "Byte Back", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/131568-touring-car-racer\n"}
