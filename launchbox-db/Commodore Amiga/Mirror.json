{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mirror", "overview": "A fan, but rather short (only 8 levels) of puzzle fun. Unlimited lives and time really make this a blast to play. Made with RedPill game creator. Mirror is a puzzle/platformer in which you control two robots at the same time. Levels count as complete when both robots end up in front an exit. Getting them there can be quite tricky. You also need to carefully navigate around spike traps and moving enemies. In later levels, you also have to collect keys to open the exit.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2017", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gus Entertainment", "publishers": "Gus Entertainment", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38WUBezXfGk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161061-mirror\n"}
