{"altername_name": [], "name": "Syndicate: American Revolt", "overview": "Syndicate: American Revolt is an expansion set designed for the Bullfrog strategy game Syndicate. During the game, the player leads a four-man team of cyborgs through the streets of a dark, dystopian world and through 21 difficult missions. The game takes place during the 22nd century, after the events of Syndicate. The entire world is controlled by a megacorporation called Eurocorp. The company has become extremely wealthy and powerful after inventing the CHIP, which is a cybernetic implant capable of altering the perceptions of human beings so that the reality of a dystopia is perceived as a utopia. The citizens of North and South America, tired of high taxes and dangerous streets, are rebelling against Eurocorp control to regain their autonomy. Rival Syndicates are using the revolt as the ideal opportunity to gain the upper hand in the ongoing struggle for supremacy. The player takes the role of a Eurocorp Syndicate executive, and the main objective of the game is to stop a massive revolt in the Americas that threatens the very existence of Eurocorp.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "DLC", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bullfrog Productions", "publishers": "Amiga Format", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndicate:_American_Revolt", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AcfKuKKl0U", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/155601-syndicate-american-revolt\n"}
