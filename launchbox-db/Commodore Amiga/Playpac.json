{"altername_name": [], "name": "Playpac", "overview": "PlayPac is a Pac-Man clone which I started to write because I wanted to learn how to program my Amiga. At the first it was supposed to be just a simple project but, thanks to people who sent mail to me, I've decided to keep the project going on and on. It has configurable size of maze, allows adding tunnels, setting number of Pacs (lives) and Ghosts, turning blackouts on and off and setting game speed and even changing the aggressiveness of the ghosts. Additional settings can be modified to give your Pac a shield, autostarting and saving high scores and tons of other treats.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1999", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Toni Lehtonen", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162789-playpac\n"}
