{"altername_name": [], "name": "Biniax 2", "overview": "Biniax 2 is the sequel to the puzzle game Biniax. It keeps the core puzzle mechanics and expands mainly through new game modes. The Arcade mode is the closest to the original version. It is an endless game on a fixed-screen board where blocks, made up out of two differently coloured pieces each, gradually drop down over the entire width of a field. The player controls a single piece with one colour and can freely move it around the board as long as there is room. The second game mode is the Tactic mode. It is a slower puzzle mode where only a limited amount of moves are available to prevent the rows from constantly reaching the bottom. The final mode is the competitive multiplayer mode with local multiplayer for two players simultaneously, each controlling a piece on the same screen", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "February 3, 2008", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jordan Tuzsuzov", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/160681-biniax-2\n"}
