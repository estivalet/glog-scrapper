{"altername_name": [], "name": "Antispyrel", "overview": "Antispyrel is an unreleased platformer that was done all the way up to the final level until the developer Stefan van de Horst of 1001 Software Developments abandoned the project. While a working version exists, there's no intro available and therefore no context on who you are or why you are there. Graphics tell you that you're a scientist inside a factory of some sort and you aim to move on by either jumping and cllimbing or by solving small puzzles.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "1001 Software Developments", "publishers": "Unreleased Prototype", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/159610-antispyrel\n"}
