The player guides the diver in a series of rooms (100 total) where the main goal is to collect gold. The main hazard encountered is the sea life that occupied the vacant ship. The character has no weapons, but carries a limited amount of \"smart fishes\", trained piranhas that attack and destroy all the enemies in the room.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Doodlebug Designs", "publishers": "Electronic Zoo", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.62", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/pJ2tNx5HKt8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72011-treasure-trap\n"}
