{"altername_name": ["Mr. Dig"], "name": "Mr Dig", "overview": "A cross between Mr. Do and Boulderdash. There are nine levels of play after which it gets faster and loops the levels. Mr Dig is a conversion of the Atari 8-bit game Mr. Do! As Mr Dig you have to collect all the cherries in each level. If you collect a group of six at a time you will get bonus points. Collecting crystals gives you 1000 points. Now and then letters will appear in the level, if you collect the word BONUS you will get an extra life and a smart bomb (smart bombs will kill all monsters in the level when used). Monsters roam the levels and they kill you on contact. You can kill the monsters by dropping apples on them. If you don't finish the level fast enough the monsters will become bored and mutate. At the start of the game you have three lives and two smart bombs.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Simon Rush", "publishers": "Polly Soft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHbpXGwHRjU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164309-mr-dig\n"}
