{"altername_name": [], "name": "Marietto", "overview": "A Pang clone written by Luca Carminati and released in 1997. Use the joystick to guide Marietto, filling the bricks one at a time. Press fire to kick enemies and P to pause. You gain a new life every 10k points. If you pick up all the coins you get 500 points. Every third coin taken will generate a power-pill, swallow it and become temporarily invulnerable to everything except bombs, nigh invulnerable! Bombs kill you, however they also kill every alien on the screen. Kick the daggers to avoid them or run over while nigh invulnerable. Bumping rocks can only happen when nigh invulnerable, otherwise they will crush you. Fling the bricks against the flying aliens, you may also be able to kick them if you are very skilled and somewhat bendy. When the going gets tough, the aliens will start shooting, so be ready for it when it happens! Bouncing aliens can be killed similarly. Drills cannot be kicked, but use nigh invulnerability against them.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1997", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Luca Carminati", "publishers": "itch.io", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DI_xp43VA-s", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164216-marietto\n"}
