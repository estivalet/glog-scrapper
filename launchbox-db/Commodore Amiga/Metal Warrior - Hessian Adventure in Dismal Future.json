{"altername_name": [], "name": "Metal Warrior: Hessian Adventure in Dismal Future", "overview": "Released over a decade after being written in 1993, the Amiga Metal Warrior game is different from its C64 namesake, although they share a theme. Set in a dystopian 2010 - where mindless pop entertainment reigns, and free-thinking art is considered an act of rebellion - this action/adventure platformer puts you in the role of a heavy metal vocalist, who has just survived the suspicious crash of his band's tour bus. Metal band members are increasingly being attacked and victimized, and it's up to the player to survive the violence in the streets, investigate matters and uncover the truth about what's going on. The inventory system provides room for weapons (to be used during the action sequences), and other items that aid you in your quest. It is possible to talk to non-hostile characters, get helpful hints, and/or trade items; certain items can also be bought and sold in various locations, using your score as money. You will also need to learn to play guitar - being a vocalist, you will need to start from the beginning: learn techniques by practicing, then use combinations of techniques to master complete songs. This will prove an essential skill for your success.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2004", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Covert Bitops", "publishers": "Covert BitOps", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109653-metal-warrior-hessian-adventure-in-dismal-future\n"}
