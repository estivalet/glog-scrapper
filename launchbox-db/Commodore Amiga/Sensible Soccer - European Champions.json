{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sensible Soccer: European Champions", "overview": "Sensible Soccer is a soccer game similar to the Kick Off series. The graphical view is from a distance overhead, making the players small on screen, but allowing players to view around half the pitch. The basic control system involves loose control, making running with the ball a skill to master, and putting the emphasis on one-touch passing, which can be easily performed by tapping the fire button. The game features customisable league and cup competitions as well as pre-set ones including the 1992 European Championships. There are 168 teams in total, 40 European nations, the 64 top club sides, and 64 custom teams with names ranging from self-indulgent to comical, and their details are fully editable. At club and country level, each team has three star players who are more gifted that the others.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Sensible Software", "publishers": "Renegade Software", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "20", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.18", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensible_Soccer", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL2T4Yn2Tq8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/62859-sensible-soccer-european-champions\n"}
