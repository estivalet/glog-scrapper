All questions are multiple choice with four answers, one correct & three incorrect, being available. Both question selection and answering are timed and must be completed in eight seconds. Scoring is cash based. All players start with \u00a31.00 and each player stakes 20p per attempt. If, by answering questions successfully, a player makes it to the top of the pyramid then they trigger a 'Cash Run' feature which can earn extra money - up to \u00a35.00.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "TAG Computer Games", "publishers": "Zeppelin Games", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "3", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.58", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73043-arcade-trivia-quiz\n"}
