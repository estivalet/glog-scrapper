{"altername_name": [], "name": "Blob Kombat", "overview": "Twenty levels of multi-player mayhem. Full version also contains a level editor to make your own games. The aim of the game is simple. You are a blob who must fight for your life in an arena against other blobs. To kill the other blobs you must jump onto their eyes and squash them. Up to three blobs may fight in the arena at once. The game allows for two players on joysticks and one player on keys. The controls are simple: left and right move you left and right and fire makes you jump. If you hold down fire you can jump higher than if you tap it. When you die, the number of lives you have decreases. When your lives reach zero you are out of the game. The game continues until only one blob is left in the arena. After you die, if you have lives remaining, you are teleported back into the arena to continue fighting. You will be invincible for a short while.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Pink Pig Software", "publishers": "Amiga Power", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "3", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VLK8tGF21c", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161991-blob-kombat\n"}
