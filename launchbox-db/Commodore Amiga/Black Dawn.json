{"altername_name": [], "name": "Black Dawn", "overview": "It is Dungeon Master in a spaceship! Okay, so it is not as deep as Dungeon Master, but it has got the walking around a 3D maze bit \u2013 with monsters too! The gameplay is pretty straightforward and involves getting from one end of a maze to the other, collecting cash and buying weapons along the way. Should you happen to meet a slimy green alien, you can splatter him across the walls with your current weapon which could be anything from a knife to a rocket launcher. You do not get the fully animated 3D texture maps of games like Legend of Kyrandia, but you can still keep track of the flick-screen 3D graphics with the help of the map.
