{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tech", "overview": "Tech is a light cycle game in which the kingdom of TECHmania is being threatened by the evil lord Caraz. He sends his tech cycle drivers (the targanoids) to beat the king's elite squad which the player is the last surviving member of. To save the kingdom, the player has to win all battles against the enemy drivers. There are 25 levels in total and in each the player has to kill all of the opposition by trapping them so that they crash into a wall or into one of the cycles' trail. The player has three lives and when they are gone there is a continue option to keep trying at the level. The levels get progressively harder with more enemy drivers and obstacles such as turrets, walls and ditches. The game also has a two player mode.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Omega Team", "publishers": "Gainstar", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/92734-tech\n"}
