{"altername_name": [], "name": "Turbo Thrust", "overview": "An avoid-it style, racing action and navigation game created by Scorpius and released in 1992. Later deemed freeware by author, Mark Sheeky, on his old website and published through itch.io. Turbo Thrust had various roots of inspiration. Years earlier, I wrote a simple vertical scrolling game on Dragon 32, where a 'Y' flew down a tunnel, and this was a surprisingly addictive hit. Years later, Salamander on the Commodore 64 had a bonus level which involved flying along a tunnel at speed. I wanted to create a race game based on these principles. Early versions of the Turbo Thrust destroyed players when they hit the wall, but this made the game impossibly hard. The game is two player only, and each player uses a joystick. The fire button accelerates. There are no penalties for crashing except losing time.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Scorpius", "publishers": "Scorpius", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162046-turbo-thrust\n"}
