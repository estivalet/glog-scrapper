{"altername_name": [], "name": "Turbo Sprint", "overview": "Turbo Sprint is based on the classic arcade game Super Sprint. The game features 8 tracks that range in difficulty; up to four players can control either a Blue, Red, Yellow, or Green car. Cars that players do not control are computer-controlled. When all 8 tracks have been completed, the game loops back to the first track, but the difficulty is increased. New players have the opportunity to join a race after each track has been completed.   Turbo Sprint was created by the talented coder Graeme Cowie who brought us Rygar AGA and Bomb Jack Beer Edition. Looking to provide the best version possible of this great fun arcade on the Amiga, Turbo Sprint is designed to run on stock AGA Amiga including A1200, A4000, and the CD 32 peripherals disabled. The original Super Sprint is one of those iconic arcade racing games from the 1980s that stood out because of its multi-player cabinet with steering wheels and featured well-balanced gameplay and striking graphics with miniature cars whizzing around twisty tracks. The game was originally ported across several home microcomputer systems, but an Amiga conversion was strangely absent.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "May 7, 2021", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mcgeezer", "publishers": "itch.io", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151473-turbo-sprint\n"}
