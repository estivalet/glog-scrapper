{"altername_name": [], "name": "Teeny Weenys", "overview": "A very good Lemmings-like puzzle game. For each level you get one of more of those little creatures, each sometimes carrying some item(s) like ladder or block (or can be picked up as well), and your job is to have the creatures, using the objects, make their way to the exit before the timer runs out. As with Lemmings, it is controlled with the mouse. The game does have some frustrating elements though. For one, the creatures move quite slow, and worse still as you can only control one at a time, you can't order one to go some place and then switch to another while he gets there: instead you have to wait until he gets there before you can switch to another creature. Also, the game seems to be one of those \u201cget everything right the first time otherwise time will run out\u201d type of games. Any slight miscalculation and it's over. The worse aspect of the game though is that you only get one life. Lose and you are back to the menu screen (though there are level codes). Still, at least they offer you a \u201crestart level\u201d button (the \"X\" at the top left), though make sure to press it before the time runs out. Still a good, and good-looking, fun game.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Visible Horizon Graphics", "publishers": "F1 Licenceware", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOjBSexbeJ8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73590-teeny-weenys\n"}
