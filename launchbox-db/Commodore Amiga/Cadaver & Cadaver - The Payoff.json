In the person of the thief Karadoc, the player sets out to raid the five stories of the castle Wulf. Legend has it that it\u2019s filled with treasure. What the legend didn\u2019t say is that the Castle is also filled with deadly traps, riddles and monsters. Surviving is not only a question of defending your life. Karadoc needs to explore the murky dungeons and eerie corridors to prove his wit in collecting and interacting with objects, putting them to the right use, mastering spells and solving tasks posed by the gods. Quick reflexes and jumping skill wouldn\u2019t hurt either. The ultimate objective is to kill the necromancer, Dianos. Karadoc's basic skills include the ability to walk, jump, climb stairs and fight monsters. There are three major modes of controlling the dwarf and his actions: basic movement, interacting with objects via icons and the rucksack. CADAVER: THE PAYOFF Cadaver: The Payoff is an add-on for Cadaver and requires the original disc from that game to play. It continues the story and offers four more isometric levels of fiendish puzzles. There are additional spells and potions as well as additional evil baddies to defeat. The in-game maps have also been completely redesigned.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "The Bitmap Brothers", "publishers": "Kixx XL", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadaver_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/134749-cadaver-cadaver-the-payoff\n"}
