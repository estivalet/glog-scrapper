{"altername_name": [], "name": "Space Crusade: The Voyage Beyond", "overview": "Space Crusade is a science fiction strategy game converted from the Games Workshop/Milton Bradley board game, in which you control a commander and four marines who are sent on different missions aboard hostile alien star ships. Your commander starts off as a sergeant, but he can work his way through the ranks. The game allows three players, each commanding one marine chapter each. The alien team is `played` by the computer. After the success of the original Space Crusade, Gremlin Graphics created 10 new levels. These had higher difficulty than the previous ones, and included new monsters and game features. This edition includes the original game and the new levels, making for 22 levels in total; a lower-priced pack with just the new levels was also released at the same time.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gremlin Graphics Software", "publishers": "Gremlin Graphics Software", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "3", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Crusade_(video_game)#Expansion", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/PbkrxvwDVrM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/100329-space-crusade-the-voyage-beyond\n"}
