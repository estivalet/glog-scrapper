{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tautrix", "overview": "A single player shareware puzzler. What does a programmer do who can't think of anything right? Well, a pebble puzzle! And if he's really deep in the creative crisis, the 183rd \"Tetris\" variant will come out of it... Ergo, we are again presented with the well-known blocks, but this time they appear in the middle of the screen and have to be puzzled together under time pressure to form single-color squares, which then disappear from the screen. The joystick or fire button is used to push and rotate, and the space bar is used to place them. If you get the right number of points, you get the password for the next level, where things get a bit more difficult due to the different shape and size of the \"building site\". The principle of the game means that more and more leftover bricks\" reduce the area that can be built on, and of course blocks of the shape and color that you would need right now never appear, in short, the \"Tetris\". usual hustle and bustle breaks out. In this respect, the game has a certain addictive quality that you cannot deny.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Michael Taupitz", "publishers": "APC&TCP", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/368962-tautrix\n"}
