{"altername_name": [], "name": "TeleEpic", "overview": "Based on the same engine as TeleWar, TeleEpic is a two-player medieval strategy game intended to be played via modem, alternatively via null-modem or taking turns at a single computer. In a split screen fashion, the top half of the screen features scrolling low resolution graphics, while the lower half contains a high-resolution user interface and a chatlog. The game is entirely controlled using the mouse, cycling between your men and pointing them at their destination, choosing weapon and direction of attack using buttons at the bottom half of the screen. Your army consists of a dozen men, all armed with throwing daggers, throwing axes, a bow and arrows and a sword for mel\u00e9e combat. Each man has a unique number of hit points and \"stride\" (movement points). In order to regenerate, he can be told to rest or heal for a turn. Battle may be done in eight directions, requiring careful placement of your units, and choosing a weapon with the correct range. Ranged weapons such as arrows or throwing axes can only be used while supplies last. The game is finished once the enemy army is destroyed, or if the flag is captured. Three scenarios with different maps and terrain features are built-in. Games may be saved and replayed later, or transfered via modem to other users. It was followed by TeleEpic II.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Software Terminal", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/167305-teleepic\n"}
