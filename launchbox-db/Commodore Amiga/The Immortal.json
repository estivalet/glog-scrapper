{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Immortal", "overview": "Your old mentor Mordamir has disappeared - probably kidnapped. You're not too sure where he might be, but a dungeon is always a good place to look, so you seek out the nearest one and plunge into its depths. Beware: eight levels of traps and deadly enemies await. The Immortal is an isometric game with puzzle-solving and action combat. Progress is made by encountering a hazard, dying, solving the problem, encountering the next hazard. To solve a level, you have to know its traps and their patterns by heart. The puzzles range from simple avoidance of traps to the correct use of items; you collect objects in an inventory. Every now and then, the game offers a special challenge. For example, you've got to ride a magic carpet through a hallway full of fire traps, or ride a barrel on an underground river.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "October 1, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Sandcastle", "publishers": "Electronic Arts, Inc.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Immortal_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40880-the-immortal\n"}
