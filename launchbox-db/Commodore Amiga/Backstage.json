{"altername_name": [], "name": "Backstage", "overview": "The year is 1993. The rock star Axel Pose is on the peak of his success and in celebration of his new album, a radio station organizes a lottery. Answer five question about this album and win a meeting with Axel Pose. This game is based on the real-life band Guns 'n' Roses and their front man Axl Rose. As a big fan, you are of course trying to buy the album immediately - but it is not as easy as it seems... As a promotional game, Backstage is neither long nor complicated. With a standard point-and-click interface you solve puzzles and speak to people. During the whole game, an advertising message is clearly delivered urging the player to join Lifeclub, a real buyer's club for purchasing products at discounted prices.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "November 27, 1993", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Art Department Werbeagentur GmbH", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/160701-backstage\n"}
