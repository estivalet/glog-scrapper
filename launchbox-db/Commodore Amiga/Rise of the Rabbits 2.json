{"altername_name": [], "name": "Rise of the Rabbits 2", "overview": "The first Rise of the Rabbits was a Dynablaster clone, but the second game is a simple platformer inspired by Super Mario Bros. You guide your little rabbit, using the joystick button to jump (rather unorthodox for an Amiga game) across the side-scrolling landscape, jumping on baddies such as mushrooms and butterflies. You have a lot of inertia and can remain suspended for quite a long time compared to Mario, but jumps also require more precision since the main sprite is rather big compared to the background blocks. The game has very little variation in the background blocks, since it is was made to fit in only 32 kilobytes, for the 32k games coding contest at the Mekka & Symposium demoparty, where the same team also released A-Type.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1998", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Abyss", "publishers": "Abyss", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D_KwH_ucwo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161876-rise-of-the-rabbits-2\n"}
