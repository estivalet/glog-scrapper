{"altername_name": ["Montezuma's Revenge Plus"], "name": "Montezuma", "overview": "A Polish remake of the classic 1980's game, this one is marked 1992, but release date shows 2013 by Jerzy P. Mikuta. It is unclear if this was a commercial release in Poland or a homebrew project. Like the original, you play as a treasure hunter named Panama Joe, whose goal is to find an ancient treasure hidden by Aztec warrior deep inside catacombs. But beware, the catacombs are a large maze inhabited by monsters. Bouncing and rolling skulls, dancing spiders, disappearing and re-appearing chains and tons of fire await you. You'll have to find many keys and unlock doors in order to reach your goal. Panama Joe can jump and climb ladders, but doesn't have much to offer in terms of combat. That's why the monsters in the game should be avoided: a collision with an enemy leads to a premature death. He will also find amulets which make him invulnerable for a short time.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2013", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jerzy P.
