{"altername_name": [], "name": "Liquid Kids", "overview": "Another cute run'n'jump romp from Taito. The hero's gimmick is his ability to shoot and burst bubbles full of water, a bit like Bubble Bobble only this one scrolls horizontally. A solid conversion that respects the original arcade game in a lot of aspects. However, some choices are strange, like the design of mountains of the first level or the musics that are nice but totally different than the original ones. The real harsh fact is of course the reduced screen size. Sprites are smaller but they don't respect the arcade proportionals in playing area, making more difficult to anticipate enemy waves. Unfortunately, despite the game being completed, the company felt that Liquid Kids would not make a profit, and its release was canceled. However, the Amiga version's lead programmer released the code to the Amiga community in 2003. In an interview given to the Amiga Lore, Thierry Levastre tells us he thinks Ocean didn't have the rights from Taito to sale this adaptation. Screen size should explain it too but in another interview on Codetapper's Amiga Retro Site, Mark Djan confirms it.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2003", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Ocean France", "publishers": "Ocean Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.3", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_Kids", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T_pzG3cI6U", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72284-liquid-kids\n"}
