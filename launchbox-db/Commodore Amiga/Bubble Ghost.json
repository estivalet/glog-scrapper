{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bubble Ghost", "overview": "This French charmer first appeared on the Amiga, and it's a game in which you play the part of a ghost trying to guide his soul (represented by a bubble) through the rooms of a castle. But how do you move a bubble without bursting it? Simple - you blow. Anyone who thinks that computer games are lacking in imagination or originality at the moment would be forced to change their mind after playing Bubble Ghost. The concept of a ghost blowing his soul around a castle full of spiked objects is just so-o-o-o weird! Having said that, I have to stress that it's great fun to play, each screen requiring even more dexterous mouse handling than the last \u2013 things get very tricky on the later levels. A special mention must go to the game's use of sound, which comprises a catchy title tune, and some humorously appropriate sound effects, such as the ghost's hacking cough when he's made to blow for too long. If your software collection is crying out for something different, Bubble Ghost is just what you're looking for.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "ERE Informatique", "publishers": "Accolade", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.62", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_Ghost", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75208-bubble-ghost\n"}
