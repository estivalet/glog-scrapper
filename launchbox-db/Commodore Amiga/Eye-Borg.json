{"altername_name": ["Eye-Borg"], "name": "Eye-Borg", "overview": "You make your way along the all seeing lake. With each stroke, you progress nearer the Retna Muntains and ultimately into The Vision Wizards Domain. Your breath becomes short and your lungs heavy as you row upstream towards a fate as yet unknown, but soon discovered. Genetic optical bio organism will surround you. You are in a land known as IRIS...once a bright and happy place. Now a dark force is playing tricks with the landscape and also its inhabitants. The Vision Wizard has devised many obscure traps and mazes to hinder the everyday lives of the land's innocent folk. You, being either brave or stupid (Why not both!!), confronted the wizard and asked him to demolish the puzzling mazes. You got used to being and eye-borg but you still wanted your body back. Make your way through the 50 challenges to get your body back.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Scrambled Thought", "publishers": "Deja Vu Software", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUZ8NY2rq_A", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162323-eye-borg\n"}
