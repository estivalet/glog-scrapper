There are 9 computer opponents in each race, and you must finish in the top 3 every time. Rockets and homing missiles can be collected so as to shoot the rival cars out. The tracks feature inbuilt hazards and treacherous shortcuts. Money is a big factor in all of this - the higher you finish in a race, the more you get; it can be collected during the race; each car you destroy gives you more money than the previous one, as you go for the Jackpot and then the Super Jackpot.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Vision", "publishers": "Acid Software", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.58", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/9927-roadkill\n"}
