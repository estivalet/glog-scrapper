The Amiga master was stolen from Kaiko at a Cologne computer fair in 1992 and Software 2000 refused to still publish it. There also exists a conversion for the PC; yet even this one has never been published.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "", "developers": "Kaiko", "publishers": "Software 2000", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/mSkunahhs3Y", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/93175-super-gemz\n"}
