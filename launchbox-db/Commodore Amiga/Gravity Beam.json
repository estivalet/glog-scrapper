{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gravity Beam", "overview": "A very good and fast gravity/thrust game that runs smoothly and needs more levels. Gravity Beam tips its second hand hat at classics such as Thrust or Lunar Lander, and as the old adage goes, 'Good artists borrow and great artists steal'. There are more stolen bits in this game than your local Cash Converters store but unlike the aforementioned pawn-shop, Gravity Beam won't empty your wallet to enjoy its wares. There are tons of clones out there, but very few are willing to try something new with the concept. Gravity Beam's gimmick is its namesake, you have a gravity beam which allows you to tow objects to their destinations.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2012", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mathew Carr", "publishers": "RGCD", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGs3Yi_bmek", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161943-gravity-beam\n"}
