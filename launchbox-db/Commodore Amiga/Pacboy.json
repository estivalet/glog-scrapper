{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pacboy", "overview": "Pacboy is a Pac-Man variant. This version of the concept differs from the original one in the maze layout which is more complex with some dead ends for the player to get trapped in. Other than that the game plays the same with the task of the player to collect all the dots in the maze while staying away from the chasing ghosts. Any contact will lead to a life being lost but by picking up special power dots located in the corners the player is able to go after and kill the ghosts for a short while. Once all dots have been collected the player moves on to the next level which has faster moving ghosts. When out of all lives the player's name can be entered for a high score.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Digital Artwork", "publishers": "Softgang", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164098-pacboy\n"}
