This means in practice that there is a board consisting of tiles, on which you have to make every tile the same, as in turning either into a colored or uncolored state. You control a cursor, and if you click on a tile, that one and every other neighboring tile around it inverses its state. Each level starts with a different pattern, and there is a time limit too.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Cosine Systems", "publishers": "Cosine Systems", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "http://www.mobygames.com/game/amiga/reaxion", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/94200-reaxion\n"}
