{"altername_name": [], "name": "Zalycon", "overview": "This is a nice shoot 'em up which has been programmed by the scener group Fanatix in 1992. The composers have done very good work. The game is set in the year 2176 on a long range colony called Zalycon, with a moonbase on a nearby moon, which is shortly thereafter attacked by aliens. You are the closest ship with a hyperspace angine, no one else will get there in time. The fate of the colony is in your hands. The first stage of the game is an avoid it type game, where you avoid the meteor shower to get there in time. Level 2 is moon buggy style mayhem to get to the armory. There is a puzzle required for access. Then you have a maze of Wolfenstein-like corridors to go through, when you find the aliens in it, the game becomes a cross-hairs shooter. If you survive, you find your way to the lab. There you confront the alien boss.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Fanatix", "publishers": "", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptF66BkOO5A", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162118-zalycon\n"}
