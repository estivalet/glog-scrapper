{"altername_name": [], "name": "Am-Tank", "overview": "Am-Tank is an artillery clone for Amiga similar to Scorched Earth. Before a battle, you get to set the mountain height, air resistance and sound effects. You move your tank and the camera, set the angle and the power of your cannon, and then fire. Whoever gets the first hit wins. The game lacks computer-controlled tanks, so the game is designed for only two players.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Rubber Duck Software", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/159571-am-tank\n"}
