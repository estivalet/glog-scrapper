To do so, he has to travel through six worlds with overall 60 levels. The game plays out as a regular platformer in which Woody walks through the level, collects power-ups, avoids obstacles (e.g. blocks with nail traps or others which crash when touched) and defeats enemies by jumping on their head.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Vision", "publishers": "Acid Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/sqCxfy7p2cM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72058-woodys-world\n"}
