{"altername_name": [], "name": "Diplomacy (Steven Douthat)", "overview": "Excellent strategy game this, closely based on the Avalon Hill board-game of the same name. The author (Steve Douthat) knows how to clone games properly though - the instructions on playing the game are not available on the disk, because they're proprietary to the board game. Even if you don't know how to play (and I certainly didn't) after an hour of mouse clicking you get the hang of it.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Steven Douthat", "publishers": "Avalon Hill", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LkHXjR4zfA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162481-diplomacy-steven-douthat\n"}
