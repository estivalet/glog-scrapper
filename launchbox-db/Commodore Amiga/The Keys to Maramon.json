{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Keys to Maramon", "overview": "Set in the same world as Magic Candle, and using a modified engine from said game. This is a single player RPG more aimed at a novice. Your job is to clear out all the monsters infesting the cellars, dungeons and dark corners of Maramon. You can chose your character at the beginning of the game. You can be either a huntsman, blacksmith, courier or a scholar. Each has slightly different abilities and all come in handy at some point. You start in the town of Maramon where you are the local sheriff, you might say. Your job is to protect the town from the monsters that come out at night. You can go to different locations, but I suggest you go and equip yourself first - so buy some weapons and armor. Both cost money, but you\u2019ll get paid on a regular basis for providing your services. Also, and conveniently, monsters will leave little money pouches behind. But where do all these \u2018generous\u2019 monsters come from? They come from the very towers that are in the city! Each night the monsters stream from one tower to cause mayhem in the town. Here\u2019s a tip: they always attack the same target on the same day. It\u2019s your job to stop and kill them before they kill you - or anyone else. This game is best described as the \u2018light\u2019 version of far better-known Magic Candle series. Mindcraft seems to be targeting the RPG newbies with simplified RPG engine and statistics-- instead of 4 characters, now you control only one. Combat and spellcasting are also not terribly exciting. Still, like Origin\u2019s Tangled Tales, it\u2019s a commendable (and underappreciated) effort to expand the RPG market.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mindcraft Software", "publishers": "Mindcraft Software", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Keys_to_Maramon", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOE-pWdLSLY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72115-the-keys-to-maramon\n"}
