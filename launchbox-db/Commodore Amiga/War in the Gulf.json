{"altername_name": [], "name": "War in the Gulf", "overview": "A third game in the tank combat series, following from Team Yankee (whose story and setting came from a book) and Pacific Islands (set in an imaginary 1995 war). The third game imagines a situation in which Iraq invades Kuwait for a second time. The series' main distinguishing feature was the way you always viewed all 4 tanks in a platoon at the same time, via a split screen. Action here is purely mouse-driven. The AI has been significantly updated from previous games in the series. A full roster of tanks and weapons are included, with Iraq mainly using Soviet machinery. A major consideration involves destroying particular buildings for money, and preventing other particular ones being destroyed, also for financial reasons.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Oxford Digital Enterprises", "publishers": "Empire Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_the_Gulf", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/105011-war-in-the-gulf\n"}
