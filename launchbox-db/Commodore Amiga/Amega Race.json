{"altername_name": [], "name": "Amega Race", "overview": "In the year 2013, The Amegan system developed a method of training its warriors to protect their star colonies. Over the city of Komar, android-controlled fighters raced to engage and destroy these Amegan warriors. The Amegan method is so succesful it commands fear and respect from all throughout the galaxies. The method is codenamed Amega Race. Amega Race is a remake of an 1981 arcade game Omega Race. You control a small triangle ie your spaceship. The ship can turn, move forward with thrusters and fire \"Droid\" ships that attack you. Once the ship is moving, it can only be slowed by turning the nose in the opposite direction and using the thrusters. There is no end to this game. Rather, it is a game in which you try to get the highest score, or complete the highest number of levels.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "November 10, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Leopold-Soft", "publishers": "Leopold-Soft", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUPLm8ZzUIg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/159452-amega-race\n"}
