It was part of the Yoghurt Boy & Defence two game pack in 1991. It all started at St Theresa\u2019s primary school. For packed lunch I always used to bring a yoghurt and my friend Jonjo always brought a Twix. We invented a game called Yoghurt Boy and Twit Man - two bungling heroes who would save the day, and then when the bell went change back into ordinary mild mannered school boys and go inside to do some French. Now we're at high school together and have started acting more normal. But when danger strikes we are ready to become said heroes again...", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jonjo Roberts", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/372430-yoghurt-boy-and-twit-man\n"}
