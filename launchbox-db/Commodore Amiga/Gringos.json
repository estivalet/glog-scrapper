{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gringos", "overview": "A freeware title from Mario Speranda, in this game two adversaries are in the desert, each with only 3 cacti to protect them from the rain bullets being traded between the two. Can you use your cover more effectively, or will your friend\\frenemy be a better shot? It is almost High Noon, so you had better hope you're a better marksman. Players of a certain age will recognize the inspiration behind Gringos: an ancient arcade game called Boot Hill (or the even older Gun Fight). Cowboy on the left, cowboy on the right, cacti or other objects between them and a stagecoach whizzing periodically up the middle. Thus assembled, what do the two cow-gentlemen in our little scene do? Shoot at each other, of course! A shot to the belly kills instantly, but a shot to the leg merely wounds: the wounded player can then only move half as fast (a tragic spectacle) but can still win. It's a very satisfying thing, actually, hobbling around on one leg and still managing to nail that flea-bitten varmint on the other side.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2016", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mario Speranda", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUK2pLw6jA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/163891-gringos\n"}
