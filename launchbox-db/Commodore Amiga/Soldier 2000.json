{"altername_name": [], "name": "Soldier 2000", "overview": "Soldier 2000 is an Action game, developed and published by Artronic Productions, which was released in Europe in 1990. So it has come to this: the horror hostage scene of the future. Who exactly caused it is immaterial. Was it the Milton Keynes Liberation Army, was it the Free F. de Klerk movement? Who cares? Someone, somewhere, has captured a balding, fat, businessman, so the crack anti-terrorist team is going on. You control a squad of fit, high-trained, ruthless brutal, cute girlies. I know they are cute because I saw one in her bikini at the arming stage, where everything starts. OK, so these girlies are pretty tough, but they are still human, so they cannot carry everything. Heavy items will slow them down until they are so overladen they cannot stand up. You will not be allowed to critically load your troops. There are 14 items to choose from, ranging from small single-shot hand guns through machine guns to grenade launchers and experimental pulse lasers. Do not forget infra red sights if you want to know where you are when the lights go out. There is no time to fool about. As you choose your equipment it will appear on your trooper at the left hand side of the screen. Remember to get ammunition for your weapons - a grenade launcher is not much good without grenades. The scenario beings with a 2D representation of the player in a corridor. Baddies may attack from the left or right. Bullets, grenades and other goodies can be picked up and proximity mines can be dropped.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Artronic Products", "publishers": "Artronic Products", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/108304-soldier-2000\n"}
