{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mr. HELI", "overview": "Mr. Heli, the hero you control in this game, is a little orange helicopter with legs. He can fly freely, but he can also walk around on the ground. The whole action is shown from a side perspective. Mr. Heli is equipped with three different weapons, each of which can be upgraded twice. Button II of your PCE-joypad fires the front gun, a bolt of blue energy, which can be upgraded to a double-shot and to a powerful (and very cool-looking) five-way cannon subsequently. Button I fires a missile straight up into the air. If powered up it is replaced by three or five homing missiles. However, if Mr. Heli doesn't fly but walk on the ground instead, button I drops bombs which explode after a short while.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Probe Software", "publishers": "Firebird Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Heli", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/105833-mr-heli\n"}
