{"altername_name": [], "name": "Guardian", "overview": "Guardian is a fast and furious shoot 'em up. You skim over the surface of a planet, shooting enemies down as quickly as you can, with the hope of protecting as may of the installations as possible - the more you save, the quicker you get extra lives. Plenty of power-ups are offered during the game, including enhanced weaponry and shields. The game is viewed in full 3D, and the camera angle can be adjusted. CD32 controllers are recommended, although keyboard and mouse are also available.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "March 1, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Acid Software", "publishers": "Acid Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.08", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guardian_%28video_game%29", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/9817-guardian\n"}
