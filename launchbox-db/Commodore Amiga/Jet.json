{"altername_name": [], "name": "Jet", "overview": "Based on subLOGIC's classic Flight Simulator. Choose either an F-16 Fighting Falcon for land missions or an F-18 Hornet for missions starting at sea from an aircraft carrier. You can practice flying and aerobatics in \"free flight\" mode, dogfight against Soviet MiGs, launch strikes against land or sea based targets, watch a demo, or load a subLOGIC scenery disk. For either combat mode, you get to select which missiles and bombs your plane will have. Most of the indicators a real jet fighter would have are present: altimeter, heading, frame loading, gear status, brake status, fuel level, radar, attitude, and range. You can turn a few of these on and off. Controls consist of either the joystick or numeric keypad for steering and other keys to handle your optional indicators, landing gear, weapons, and even the eject button! Lastly, if you want a different perspective, you can get a view from the control tower instead of your cockpit.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sublogic", "publishers": "Sublogic", "genres": "Flight Simulator", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/74310-jet\n"}
