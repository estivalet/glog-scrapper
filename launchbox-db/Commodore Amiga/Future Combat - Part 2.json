The hostile forces have returned and are trying to take over your planet. They have come in large numbers. The Earth's defense system is overwhelmed, we have plans for a new type of fighter that can stop them, our only hope is if you can somehow get the plans to the factory in time. So you must strap into your shuttle fighter and take them on like it is 1942 in space!", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ard Joosse", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixwAQfaldPs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162329-future-combat-part-2\n"}
