It is an unusual game where you have to fly round an ocean and shoot at various unusual beasts. The plot centers around a \"Sea Child\" who was stolen, and Typhoon Thompson is sent in to rescue it, with the guidance of a few strange, cowled ghost-types (who would occasionally be nasty to poor old TT).", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dan Gorlin Productions", "publishers": "Br\u00f8derbund Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoon_Thompson", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/tPj_AmKCrLg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72257-typhoon-thompson-in-search-for-the-sea-child\n"}
