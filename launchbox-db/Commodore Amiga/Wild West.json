{"altername_name": [], "name": "Wild West", "overview": "Wild West is a first-person shooter. The game takes place in the Wild West. The player may select one of two available cowboys - first guided by the keyboard in exchange for higher energy level, second is directed with a mouse, with very limited energy level. The gameplay is arranged on a single board. The player's task is to track down and kill the enemies before they fire a bullet. The game is divided into four scenery chapters (sun plain, jail, dead city, valley of the shadow), each made of four stages and one bonus mini stage, involving rabbits killing. The last stage is played as a typical wild west style duel with a Robson as a final opponent.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Death Kiss", "publishers": "L.K.
