{"altername_name": [], "name": "Eishockey Manager", "overview": "Eishockey Manager is a German managerial simulator in which you are manager of a team in the German Hockey League (the game was released shortly before the league changed its name from \"Bundesliga\" to \"DEL\"). The game contains real player and team names. Eishockey Manager allows the player to handle most of the relevant aspects of a hockey team, both economic- and sport-wise. He can trade players, organize the training, handle the team's line-ups and tactics, negotiate contracts with players and sponsors, and expand the team's stadium. Your team's games can either be watched in a ticker-like text display only, or with animated, prerendered, goal-scenes. Up to four players can play simultaneously in hot-seat mode. As opposed to Software 2000's six game soccer manager series, Eishockey Manager remained the only hockey manager ever released by this publisher. Technically Eishockey Manager represents a step between Bundesliga Manager Professional (1991) and Bundesliga Manager Hattrick (1995).", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Kron Simulation Software", "publishers": "Software 2000", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.62", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grbv9POatY8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/62591-eishockey-manager\n"}
