{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sneech", "overview": "Imagine Tron with up to 10 cycles on a screen which keeps filling up with walls and traps, and tons of powerups to collect. Vroom-vroom cycle noises and crazy spot sound effects taken from some weird Salvador Dali alternate universe. Plus a shop with a 3-page list of powerups, its not hard to imagine this game can be fun. Sneech is an excellent party game for up to 6 players. Another good game in the Amiga's strong library of shareware and freeware releases. Paul Burkey went on to work on the ambitious commercial release of Foundation, a clone of Blue Byte's The Settlers. Sneech was included as a bonus on the CD-ROM of Foundation Gold.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Daisy Software", "publishers": "", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "6", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.33", "wikipedia": "http://hol.abime.net/4064", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109741-sneech\n"}
