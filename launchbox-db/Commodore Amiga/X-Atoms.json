{"altername_name": [], "name": "X-Atoms", "overview": "Atoms-X is a remake of an old game called Atoms I ( Rob Cranley aka Rob the Nerd ) had on the Amiga years ago. It was written by a reader of one of the Amiga magazines of the time and they gave it away on their cover disk. Something reminded me of it recently, and I had a quick search for it. It turns out there are a couple of basic clones for Linux and Android, and one or two for Amiga, but none that particularly appealed to me. So I decided to write my own version which is fully Workbench-friendly, and to include a computer opponent, something the original never had. This version of Atoms-X includes 3 levels of difficulty for the computer players, although often the games get to a stage where even a totally random move can cause a massive chain reaction that wins the game, so don't get angry when the easiest computer opponent beats you!! The hardest level can really be a nasty opponent, making surprisingly tactical moves. Again though, sometimes it just comes down to luck...", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Misoftware Computing", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/369292-x-atoms\n"}
