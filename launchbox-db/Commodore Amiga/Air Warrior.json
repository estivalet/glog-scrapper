{"altername_name": [], "name": "Air Warrior", "overview": "Air Warrior is a Simulation game, developed by Kesmai and published by On-Line, which was released in 1990. How many PD flight simulators have you ever come across? None. Air Warrior is a different sort of flight simulator, aimed at those who prefer dogfights to final approaches. The planes available range from the lowly World War I Spad to the rather good Super Sabre of the 1950s. Tank, jeeps and trucks can also be driven around the battle area. There is more to it than choosing a plane and roaring off the runway. Air Warrior runs in two different modes: practise and online. In practise mode, there are no enemy planes and no dogfights \u2013 it is very good for getting flying practice. To get at the real game you will need a modem. The idea is that you dial a number, and join in a war where all the pilots are human. That is right, in Air Warrior you can have many planes shooting at each other in a very small airspace.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Kesmai", "publishers": "On-Line Entertainment", "genres": "Flight Simulator", "max_players": "50", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.56", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Warrior", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k35euksXnTg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/71417-air-warrior\n"}
