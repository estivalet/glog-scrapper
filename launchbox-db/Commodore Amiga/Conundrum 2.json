{"altername_name": [], "name": "Conundrum 2", "overview": "A shareware puzzle game from Pete W. Storonskij, released in 1994. Conundrum 2.0 is an abstract hexagonal based board game, wher the object is to negate all of the colored tiles by placing them next to each other. This game was inspired by those hexagonal floor tiles you find on restroom floors. Once you start you have 10 seconds to place a tile, each tile ranges from 1 to 10, having its own color configuration. The number on the tile is the number of negations that must be done on it. Tiles are negated by placing them side by side. The game starts with six negations per tile and can be negated from any adjacent position. The number of tile types starts slowly to allow you to understand the game play. You are given tiles and exploding tiles to play with.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Pete W.
