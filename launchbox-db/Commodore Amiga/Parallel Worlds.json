{"altername_name": [], "name": "Parallel Worlds", "overview": "A multi-directional fighting game for the Amiga. Released as a late Christmas gift, guide Marco the dwarf and her friend Elena the elf through the Kingdom of Cassiopeia in a parallel world to rescue the Wizard Fenix from the clutches of his evil brother. Inspired by classic arcade games such as Ghosts'n'Goblins, Tiger Road or Rygar, Parallel Words is a decent enough Amiga game as you fight different creatures with weapon in hand in what feels like a Lord of the Rings backdrop.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2015", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "", "developers": "Amiten Software", "publishers": "", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKx96uKBEfc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161839-parallel-worlds\n"}
