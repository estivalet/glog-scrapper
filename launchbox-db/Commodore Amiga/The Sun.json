{"altername_name": ["The Sun: You Cannot Be Sirius"], "name": "The Sun", "overview": "An Egyptian themed game by Matt West of aiXS Software also released as part of the CD32 Games pack. Imagine a sun surrounded by 8 planets. You can rotate them around in their orbits using your controller. Each planet is represented by one of the 8 icons or glyphs. The glyph of a planet is cycled by shoot a star at it. The glyphs are, in cycle order. Hand, Kids, Cat, Dog, Star, Rabbit, UFO, EMU. As all this is going on the sun is sinking, once it sets the game is over. In the top right is the target glyph, when you hit a planet with the same glyph as the target the following occurs: If all the planets are the target you've got a match and the sun rises to its original height. If only some are the target the sun rises a bit for each one that matches. All the planets with the target glyph are now replaced with new random glyphs. So your objective is to get as many matches as you can, while getting a high score while trying to stop the sun from setting. Easy as pi. EXCEPT! The planets attack the sun and drag it down. Shooting them repels them and changes the glyphs. Every 8k points the speed of the planets increases.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1997", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "aiXS Software", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vT1tcxlPf0Q", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162036-the-sun\n"}
