{"altername_name": [], "name": "Snake in the Grass", "overview": "A snake\\worm game that seems to be using two sounds from Anders Bjerin's freeware game SYS (1989): the smacking of lips whenever you eat a white mushroom and the \"Yehaa!\" when you pick up bonus mushrooms. While the smacking of lips is always sped-up, the \"Yehaa!\" is either sped-up or slowed-down, depending on what bonus you pick up. It was created by Peter Harris with these assets and released to public domain in 1993.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Peter Harris", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrvK7rjWHEc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162098-snake-in-the-grass\n"}
