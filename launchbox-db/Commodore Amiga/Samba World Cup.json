{"altername_name": ["Samba World Cup 98"], "name": "Samba World Cup", "overview": "An action football game with a heavy slice of management released in German and English markets known variously as Samba World Cup and Samba World Cup 98 (and possibly Samba 3 World Cup?), supporting both AGA and ESC video and created by Jo Seitz, Emmanuel Henn\u00e9 with music by Jochen Heizmann (Joe Heizmann), it was unfortunately released a little too late to coincide with the France '98 Tournament as they failed to get the FIFA endorsement or sanction. But while it looks a bit too much like USA '94 it does have lots of goodies: sampled speech, throw ins, free kicks and penalty shots.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sayonara Software", "publishers": "Sayonara Software", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165017-samba-world-cup\n"}
