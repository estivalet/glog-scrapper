{"altername_name": ["Stable Masters 3"], "name": "Stable Masters III", "overview": "In this updated and improved version of the Stable Masters franchise you again take on the role of a horse trainer to raise and train a thoroughbred horse in preparation of horse derby races. The player must first purchase a horse (each of which performs differently in racing). Then the player must choose a jockey that can ride and work with the horse. Finally the player must pick a race course. The player's choices affect the outcome of the race. If the player's horse wins, then the player earns money needed to fund the hiring fees and stable expenses. This game has improved graphics, but only supports a single player mode.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "ESP", "publishers": "ESP Software", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162742-stable-masters-iii\n"}
