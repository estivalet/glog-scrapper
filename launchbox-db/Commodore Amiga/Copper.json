{"altername_name": [], "name": "Copper", "overview": "Copper is an homage to Arkanoid, the objective of the game is to destroy all the bricks on the screen with the ball. Some bricks may take only one hit to disappear, others may take as many as 8 hits. Different bonuses pop up like viruses around the bricks if you hit them you will see the effect, some allowing remote control of the ball, others destroying all bricks in the path of the ball, giving your ship\\vaus\\bat a \"lazer\" or doubling your ball. These power ups only last about 20 seconds in many cases.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hai Truong", "publishers": "Hai Truong", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7qYnjnRtRk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/163749-copper\n"}
