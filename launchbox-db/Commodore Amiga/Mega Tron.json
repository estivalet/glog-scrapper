{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mega Tron", "overview": "A Tron inspired Snake\\Worm game for up to 7 humans and a total of 10 other players! IN it you steer a rasterbike and have to kill the other players by jamming them and forcing them into a wall. To make this easier, you and your opponents have access to three weapons from an arsenal of nine. Like in real life, nothing is free. Although the weapon's ammunition is unlimited, all of them cost a certain amount of money. You earn money by simply staying alive or by killing another player. If you have exterminated all opponents you will enter the next round with now more than 1000 credits in your pockets and 2 bonus points. Use those points to fund your next set up weapons!", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Chris Hodges", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "10", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pR4oSgq45cY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164246-mega-tron\n"}
