{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sound the Space Cadet", "overview": "SOUND THE SPACE CADET ** was included on the cover disk of Amiga Action Issue #65. A 2D platformer, collector game. A precursor to Ace The Space-Case. I started laughing the first time I saw the attack animation of the player sprite: It is literally impossible to shoot something that is right in front of you because shots fly out at an 45-degree angle. You have bounce shots off the ceiling, and even then, enemies are only affected by the explosion frame of the animation. Unexploded projectiles which you have just thrown do not hurt them. You will constantly spam the attack button, yet only a fraction of your shots will count. It is one of the most ineffective, frustrating-to-use weapons I have ever seen in a game, and I love it!", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Scott Hayne", "publishers": "Amiga Action", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4E_5fZzJGBY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161893-sound-the-space-cadet\n"}
