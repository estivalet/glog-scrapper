{"altername_name": [], "name": "Kiro's Quest", "overview": "Kiro's Quest is a skill and logic game where you have to fill impassable water with ice, so that the frozen nuts reach and be happy. Opponents make life difficult for Kiro by their very presence, for any contact with them inevitably leads to loss of life. As a further hindrance, some passages can only be passed in one direction. These plates are marked with directional arrows. Even ice blocks can pass these plates only in the specified direction. Partially, due to the arrows, you will have to consider substantial detours, when open paths are blocked with ice blocks.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Vision", "publishers": "Linel", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/74315-kiros-quest\n"}
