{"altername_name": [], "name": "Legion of Doom", "overview": "Set on September 11, 2027, the problem: mankind's many space voyages between Earth and Mars awoke something from under the surface of the red planet. Large, primitive demons have been sighted arsing from the planet's surface, killing astronauts and destroying most of the space station complex based on planet Mars. The existence of this alien race was kept top secret until December 6, 2026 when one demon appeared in Paris France. Fatalities: 166 Steadily over the past months at exactly 00:01 each night various types of these \"Martians\" have arisen from under the ground all around the Earth. Demons rising in populated areas act instinctively, killing people. Others rising in deserts, jungles and even under water will work with other demons in the building of unknown alien structures. The world's armed forces have killed over a thousand of the demons, but with the seemingly endless supply of the enemy, it feels like we are fighting a losing battle. The only solution is that the enemy supply must be stopped at the source. You are chosen for the mission to the demon's planet. This is a Doom-esque, overhead view shooter.
