{"altername_name": [], "name": "Krillian Incident", "overview": "As the Federation spread out across the known galaxy, outposts were constructed for scientific research. These outposts are the life blood for those colonies in the surrounding areas. While the Federation consists of thousands of worlds, not all races have joined them. Diplomatic relations are always underway to gap the differences and maintain peace. The Federation outposts 16, 17 and 18 are close to the boarder of the race called the Krill. The Krillian are a proud race that prefers isolationism. Diplomatic relations have become strained recently. Certain fractions within their society have sworn to drive out the Federation from this quadrant by destroying these outposts. The outposts themselves have limited defense capabilities and can only hold out from a direct assault for a short time. Your primary assignment will be to defend them against attack. You have also been authorized to destroy all the renegade ships within this quadrant.
