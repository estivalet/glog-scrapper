{"altername_name": [], "name": "Atic Atac", "overview": "Atic Atac for Amiga is a conversion of the 1983 ZX Spectrum game. It mixes arcade gameplay with exploration of a large castle and light puzzle-solving. The player needs to find a way out of the castle he's trapped in. In order to do that, he must find the required keys. Enemies appear in each room. The player can choose to collide with them, which destroys the enemies but also drains health from the main character. Some enemies cannot be killed by conventional means and must be either avoided or dealt with by using special items. The player character's life meter gets gradually depleted. Health can be restored by consuming food scattered around the castle, but the countdown cannot be stopped.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Neil Chinnery", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/160271-atic-atac\n"}
