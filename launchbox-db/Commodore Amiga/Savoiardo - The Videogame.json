Savoiardo is a puzzle game, it was conceived by TYN, among thousand unfinished projects, and is the first completed game from the 4 Seasons Team. The game was made to \"pay homage\" to a weird character born from JEFF's imagination. The SAVOIARDO (a famous brand name in Italy) is a tall and very strong biscuit-man who have the power to absorb anything. Actually, the SAVOIARDO it's only the testimonial of the game.In order to win the game, you'll have to pile up figurines with the purpose of reproducing exactly the composition on the right of the screen. Here's how it works. The game will give you a figurine. You can discard it or let it drop into a column. If you put a figurine in the wrong place, the column will be erased and you'll have to rebuild the column again.When you place correctly all the figurines in order to reproduce the exact composition, you win the game.
