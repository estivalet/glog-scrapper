{"altername_name": [], "name": "Santa's Xmas Caper", "overview": "Despite being published by the same company and sharing the same title, Santa's Xmas Caper on the Amiga is different from its 8-bit cousins. Instead of a scrolling shoot 'em up, it is a platform game. While riding on his slide, Santa loses all his pressies. The gifts scattered all across the country, Santa must traverse multiple-scrolling platform-levels collecting them back. When they are all collected, an exit opens granting him access to the next level. Each level is crowded with spiky pitfalls, slippery platforms and cute-looking but nasty baddies. By throwing snowballs, the baddies can be stunned for a short while. Complete all seven levels and Christmas will be saved.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Zeppelin Games", "publishers": "Zeppelin Games", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/102075-santas-xmas-caper\n"}
