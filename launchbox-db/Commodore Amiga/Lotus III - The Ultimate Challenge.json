{"altername_name": [], "name": "Lotus III: The Ultimate Challenge", "overview": "Licensed by the classic British car company, this game featured 2 modes of play - one has you racing against 19 computer rivals (with witty names such as Alain Phosphate and Crash-Hard Banger), and the other pits you against the clock. There are 13 different types of races, ranging from Motorways to night-time to sections punctuated by roadworks, and some are lap-based with others being simple A-B. 2 players could play on a split screen mode. The game's crowning glory, however, was the RECS editor, which allowed you to create courses of your own, with theoretically millions possible.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Magnetic Fields", "publishers": "Gremlin Graphics Software", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.02", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_%28series%29#Lotus_III:_The_Ultimate_Challenge", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXOu_ZTehks", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/24016-lotus-iii-the-ultimate-challenge\n"}
