Here you must stop the little men with axes from chopping down the trees. You are in a bulldozer and stop them by driving over them or shooting them. It's not as easy as it first appears as the axemen move faster than the bulldozer.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mark Potter", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/372326-save-the-trees\n"}
