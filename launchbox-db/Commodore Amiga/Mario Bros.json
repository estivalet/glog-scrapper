{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mario Bros", "overview": "Thomas Agermose Jensen brings Nintendo's famous character Mario (and Luigi) to the Amiga in this unoffical conversion of the C64 Mario Bros game. Interestingly, Ocean released a Mario Bros game on the C64 but there was also another unreleased conversion by Atarisoft. The gameplay is classic Mario Bros with the two plumbers clearing out sewers by headbutting platforms from below to knock over various creatures or by using the limited use POW button which overturns all enemies on the screen at the same time. The developer Thomas found the disk for Mario Bros when working through his old floppy collection. It would never have been released commercially due to issues of copyright but could have been a freeware game if released in 1993.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Thomas Agermose Jensen", "publishers": "", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOQhDfdbbNY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162210-mario-bros\n"}
