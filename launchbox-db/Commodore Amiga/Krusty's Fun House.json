{"altername_name": [], "name": "Krusty's Fun House", "overview": "Ask any Simpsons fan and they will tell you it\u2019s not just Bart, Lisa, Homer, Marge and Maggie that make the show worth going to a BSkyB-owning friend\u2019s house to watch. It\u2019s the subsidiary characters too: people like Itchy \u2018n\u2019 Scratchy, and Krusty the clown. Krusty\u2019s Super Fun House is a good-looking, nicely thought-out platform game which should be able to keep the most jaded of gamers on their toes for a while. You move Krusty about a few platforms, each of which contains a number of doors. Simply stand outside a door, soak in the strangely menacing music, press the fire-button and in you go to one of the sub-levels. Then all you have to do is to play a kind of reverse Troddlers/Lemmings in which you have to lead a bunch of rats to their deaths at the hands of a major Simpsons character. Like Troddlers you have to make use of blocks to achieve this aim. Unlike Troddlers you have to search for these blocks along your way - and this search becomes more difficult with the later levels. The game looks excellent, there\u2019s some great use of colour and neatly designed levels, but it\u2019s let down by strange parallax scrolling and poor collision detection. Despite the moans Krusty\u2019s Super Fun House is a mightily enjoyable piece of Amiga gameplay. Once you\u2019ve got over the initial amazement that Krusty himself can outleap Bob Fosbury from a standing start, you will find yourself coming back for more and more.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Audiogenic Software", "publishers": "Acclaim Entertainment", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krusty%27s_Fun_House", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTkGxz2WeGg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72171-krustys-fun-house\n"}
