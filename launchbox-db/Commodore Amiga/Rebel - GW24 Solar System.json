{"altername_name": [], "name": "Rebel: GW24 Solar System", "overview": "Rebel: G24 Solar System is a science-fiction real time strategy inspired by Dune II. The action takes place in the G24 star system, where the rebels took over the planet. As a lead commander the player must restore the order by expansion of the base, scientific research, gathering and proper use of military power and harvesting raw materials. The game features only one linear campaign with classic genre goals, such as harvesting an appropriate number of raw materials, repulsing the attack of the enemy troops or destroying the enemy base. The game allows multiple control of the troops. Building the facilities and the troops requires two types of raw materials: Materian occurring on trees and Belon located in the sand - both require another type of harvesting unit. Military units are divided into ground and air troops. More advanced facilities and units require laboratory research.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "June 18, 2011", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Strategic Simulations", "publishers": "Polski Portal Amigowy", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1LqTu-zqB4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161834-rebel-gw24-solar-system\n"}
