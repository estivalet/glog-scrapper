The aim of the level is to switch all the red modules to green and collect a predefined appropriate number of falling hearts. If you let a heart touch the ground you will lose a life. If you let an zombie worker touch you, you will lose a life. If you let a bullettouch you, you will lose a life, If you play too much videos game, you will lose your mind (cheasy!).", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "October 13, 2007", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "", "developers": "Nori Khiat", "publishers": "", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/370919-super-pumpkin-bros\n"}
