{"altername_name": [], "name": "Truckin On", "overview": "Truckin On is a 2 player game with the object to make more money than your opponent over a given time period. Each player is allocated $10,000 to start a Truckin Company. A knowledge of the trucks capacity and fuel consumption is required and this can be obtained at the relevant truckyard. Also an indication of the trucks mileage capacity is indicated at the Service Station. There are a number of pitfalls which may be encounted on the road but these are self explanatory and require little reference. The record so far is to turn $10,000 into assets of $1,000,000 in less than 10 weeks, if anyone can improve on that they should be with Allen Bond.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Ron Lewis", "publishers": "17-Bit Software", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73691-truckin-on\n"}
