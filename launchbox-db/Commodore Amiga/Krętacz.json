{"altername_name": ["Kretacz"], "name": "Kr\u0119tacz", "overview": "Kr\u0119tacz is a timed puzzle-solving game. The objective of the game is creating an electrical circuit by rotating wires before the time runs out. Before each level a small map appears, allowing to choose a proper tactic. Any part of the wire may be rotated only when standing in the middle of the steel circle. After each completed level the player receives a password. Some wires are connected by chains \u2013 moving one wire affects all other, some other are permanently nailed to the surface and can't be moved at all. The task is complicated by hungry worms and falling items, balanced by power ups, such as extra time, energy or points.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Mirage Software", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/131304-kretacz\n"}
