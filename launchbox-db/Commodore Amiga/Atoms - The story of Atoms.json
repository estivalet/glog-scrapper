Your goal is to wipe out all the other players' atoms before they do it to you. Players take turns to place an atom of their colour on the playing grid. When too many atoms get together in a single sqiare it will overload and blow outwards to the surrounding squares, possibly overloading them and continuing the blast. When the atoms get blasted, they will change their color to that of the current player.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Halibut Software", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "6", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/160306-atoms-the-story-of-atoms\n"}
