{"altername_name": [], "name": "Airmania!", "overview": "Airmania! is essentially an adventure game. You have ten minutes to catch a flight at the airport. Buy your ticket, check in your baggage, go through passport control, buy as much duty free as possible, and get to the departure gate in time. If you did this in three levels and then phoned the developers, you were apparently eligible for free air trip around the world. The protagonist is PiMan, a character who originally appeared in the 1982 game Pimania.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Addware", "publishers": "Addware", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gShyppaT1Eo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/159300-airmania\n"}
