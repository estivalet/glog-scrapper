{"altername_name": [], "name": "Harpoon Battleset 4: Indian Ocean / Persian Gulf", "overview": "Harpoon BattleSet 4: Indian Ocean / Persian Gulf (IOPG) was the last BattleSet published for the Amiga. It featured 16 scenarios (playable from both sides of the conflict), a new map of the Indian Ocean (Persian Gulf included), more ships, subs, aircraft (also stealth ones) and weapons (e.g. cruise missiles). New countries were added to support local conflicts (e.g. Iran vs. Iraq). While most Harpoon scenarios from that era were hypothetical NATO vs. USSR encounters, this BattleSet also featured historical mission based on 1991 Gulf War.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "DLC", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Three-Sixty Pacific", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/131641-harpoon-battleset-4-indian-ocean-persian-gulf\n"}
