{"altername_name": [], "name": "Invasion", "overview": "A clone of Jim Sachs' C64 game SAUCER ATTACK, but with a different scoring system. SAUCER ATTACK forced the player to shoot sparingly as each bullet counted against you, whereas INVASION allows infinite bullets. Aliens in their flying saucers have invaded Earth and have set their sights on destroying the capital of the USA, Washington D.C and all it's landmarks. You have been given the task of destroying the invaders by blasting them with your Energy gun in a bunker outside the city. The game is viewed from a 1st person perspective with the game shown on one screen and you control a gun sight to blast the saucers before facing the Mothership in space.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sector Software", "publishers": "Entertainment & Computer Products", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZE3P8D1UP0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/155468-invasion\n"}
