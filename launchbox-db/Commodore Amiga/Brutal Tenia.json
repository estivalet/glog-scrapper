You are a kind of worm, at the top of the screen, and undergo a vertical scrolling, namely that the screen moves from bottom to top, and that on the playing area, there are plenty of obstacles. On your side, you can only move to the left and to the right, the goal being to accumulate the greatest number of points possible (a bit like for Fnurr 2000 ) while avoiding as many obstacles as possible.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Papandrea Giovanni", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFR-EtGXRH8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162426-brutal-tenia\n"}
