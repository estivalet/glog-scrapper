{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bouncing Bill", "overview": "Bouncing Bill is a non-scrolling platformer in which the player controls a ball which moves through four scenarios (house, jungle, forest and space). The ball can roll or jump which is necessary to leap over gaps, collect items (e.g. keys) and avoid enemies which move through the screens on fixed paths. The screens are interconnected with exits and can be explored in a non-linear fashion. Running out of time, jumping too far down or touching an enemy results results in the loss of a life.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "NoName-Soft", "publishers": "CompuTec Verlag", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75172-bouncing-bill\n"}
