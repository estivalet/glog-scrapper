{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sensible World of Soccer '96/'97", "overview": "The updated Sensible World of Soccer, with more up-to-date-teams and less of the bugs from the previous version. SWOS is a top down football/management game, with either quick game or 20-year career player-manager options. The games are set to last 3 minutes, but the 20-year career can suck in your entire life for a few months. The graphics are kept very small so the player can orientate themselves on the pitch without need for a radar. The controls are simple, easy to get used to and very effective. In the full career mode you can jump from club-to-club buying any of the game's 29000+ players, as well as play around with team tactics. And you can choose from 1400 teams over the five continents.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Sensible Software", "publishers": "Renegade", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.68", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensible_World_of_Soccer", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNFOyF9bVt4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/23838-sensible-world-of-soccer-9697\n"}
