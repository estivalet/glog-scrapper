{"altername_name": [], "name": "Metal Gear", "overview": "Originally released in 1987 for the MSX2, Metal Gear became an instant classic. Designed by the legendary Hideo Kojima, it spawned a huge franchise in stealth gameplay and is considered one of the top games from the platform. While there are ports for the NES, Spectrum and C64 they were missing a lot of the key details from the original game. An Amiga version was once advertised in a magazine but sadly was consigned to myth and legend. That is until now. Based on a full and commented disassembly by Manuel Pazos of the original MSX2 game cartridge, this Amiga port has been built to ensure as near a perfect conversion as possible. Gameplay elements remain intact while additional features have been layered on-top to ensure the fullest experience possible of Metal Gear on the Amiga.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "May 21, 2021", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "H0ffman", "publishers": "H0ffman", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bp7i7QS3AY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151923-metal-gear\n"}
