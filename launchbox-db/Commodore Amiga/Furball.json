{"altername_name": [], "name": "Furball", "overview": "Furball is a shareware platform game written in AMOS, developed and published by Dimensions Software for the Amiga. The game is called Furball and is free. You may remember (if you\u2019ve been using an Amiga for any length of time) the small game Dithell in Space? Same author. The game itself plays smoothly and has lots of colourful graphics. Sprite collision works well, and the game is a nice little time waster. You need to eliminate baddies by jumping on them and find the exit to complete the stage. Some baddies need to be jumped on more than once or from greater heights. If you like platformers, give it a try!", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Dimensions Software", "publishers": "Dimensions Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpZJKSycavw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/67222-furball\n"}
