For each of them, you can determine if it will be played by the computer or by a human, in which case you will choose the control mode (gamepad 1, gamepad 2, keyboard...). Hey there, let's go! You will soon find yourself in RGB circuits.

The principle consists of colliding with the other competitors to make them suffer damage and get them out of the playing area.
