{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ingenuous", "overview": "...and so it was that on September the 5th, 1981, the judge of High-Wickams court ruled the defendant Mr. Dustin Westard guilty of brutally murdering a class of 28 seven year old girls. The defendant's heart froze as the decision was handed down.\"I'm innocent, innocent I tell you! It wasn't me, it was...\" The guards took Mr. Dustin Westward to the highest security prison in the country. Known only as The Point of No Return. His life was as good as over. The prison was underground, with armed guards roaming the corridors day and night. The prison had few prisoners, the reason for this was simple.Only the most brutal people were sent here.Within seven days of arriving at the facility, the prisoner was automatically sent to the electric chair. Mr.Westward knew he must escape with the 7 days or he would be eradicated for something he had not done. A plan started to form, with info from other prisoners about a guard meeting that would reduce the number of available guards to a small fraction of what is normally in use it looked like he he might just have hope.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Firstrate Effex", "publishers": "Asa Margetts", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLxlTFWumcI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161555-ingenuous\n"}
