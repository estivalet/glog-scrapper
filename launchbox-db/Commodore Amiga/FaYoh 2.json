{"altername_name": ["A New Adventure FaYoh 2"], "name": "FaYoh 2", "overview": "The most horrible thing has happened! Don Jockface, a black bubblegum stole FaYoh's gum-machine. FaYoh, a green gum, used it as storage for his stars. No one actually knows what stars are good for, but gums sure enjoy collecting them. Don Jockface had no interest in the starts though. He just wanted to search for lost coins in the machine. So the black gum carried the machine to the top of his tower, where he thought he could work undisturbed. FaYoh must, of course, get his bubblegum-machine back. But that's not all! Don Jockface carried the machine carelessly and dropped stars everywhere in the big tower. Before gum-fighting with Don, FaYoh must find the lost stars!", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1998", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "NC.
