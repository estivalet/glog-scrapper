{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tom & Jerry 2", "overview": "The game uses the exact same engine as 'Tom & Jerry: Hunting High and Low' (including the title screen). It is a level disk as a standalone game. Two of the most popular cartoon creations of all time have now been brought to the computer screen. Everybody always refers to Jerry as the cutest little mouse you ever did see etc, etc, but I have a sneaking suspicion that true fans of the programs found him to be too good to be true and much preferred Tom, the anti-hero. Nevertheless, there is no option within the game; you must control Jerry. He is hungry and looking for a supply of his favourite cheese. There is plenty scattered around the house but Tom is out to do his best not to let him get any. The action is that of a platform game as you leap round the furniture trying to reach the cheese before Tom grabs you. There are a number of devices that you can use to keep Tom at bay for a few vital seconds. Most successful is to drop something on his head, such as a hammer, vase or bowling boll. You can also distract him by turning on the television or setting off a jack-in-the-box. I can find nothing to recommend about this game whatsoever. Both Tom and Jerry fans and casual games players will be extremely disappointed if they pay good money for this drivel.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Micro-Partner", "publishers": "Magic Bytes", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0-RKrPFv-g", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73669-tom-jerry-2\n"}
