{"altername_name": [], "name": "Light Racer", "overview": "Light Racer is a Tron Light Cycle clone which is actually not too bad. It's a German made game so don't expect to know what is being said in the digitized sound intro or the text in the game, unless you know German. The game itself is pretty basic but can be quite addictive. There are various options and extras to turn on in the settings. The game also seems to be 2 player game.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Andreas Eberl", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/131904-light-racer\n"}
