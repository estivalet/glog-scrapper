It features a full career mode, in which your created player starts at the bottom of a ladder of 100 players (including stars of the era such as Sampras, Edberg and Stich), and adjusts his abilities (in areas such as service, forehand and lob) using a small amount of points. The game season features a range of tournaments, form the grand Slam events to ordianry tour events with a limited field, and it is these that you have the chance to enter at first. The game is viewed from above and slightly behind the court, a view which will be familiar to anyone who's played a Pro Tennis Tour AKA Great Courts game. Grass, clay, hardcourt and indoor grounds are provided, and individual 1 or 2 player matches can be played over 1,3 or 5 sets.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gernot Fritsche", "publishers": "Acid Software", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.88", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/88855-center-court\n"}
