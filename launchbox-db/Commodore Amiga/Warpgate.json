{"altername_name": [], "name": "Warpgate", "overview": "The plan is to make the game a scrolling platform game where the aim is to get home. To do this you have to find the the exit on each level. You will have a warp gun (might be a bit portal like) that will allow you to get to different parts of the screen or interact with objects. At the end of each level a warp will take you to a mini-game. You must complete the mini-game to collect a section of the warpgate. Once all the sections are completed you have one last journey (mingame) to get home and finish the game.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2019", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "", "developers": "Havie", "publishers": "", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/371192-warpgate\n"}
