{"altername_name": [], "name": "Shisen-Sho", "overview": "Shisen-Sho is an Amiga adaptation of the mahjong game for both English and German speaking players, though not much is needed either way. The player must remove all tiles from the board by pairing matching tiles up; only visible tiles whose longer side is completely unobstructed can be removed. Only two matching tiles may be removed at a time, and they can only be removed if they are connected by a horizontal or vertical path via empty or vacant spaces. If no moves are available and tiles are left on the board, the game is lost. Shisen-Sho uses custom tiles by the game's developer Franz \"Zebulon\" Janisch of the Stylon Crew, rather than the traditional set and additional rules were added to spice things up a bit including multiplier stones, stones farther from each other give more points. Helps can blast away stones but you will score better if you do not use them.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2000", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Stylon Crew", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crFQQkmHLcY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162562-shisen-sho\n"}
