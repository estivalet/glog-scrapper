{"altername_name": [], "name": "Street Rod 2", "overview": "SR2 is primarily a racing game, with an interesting premise. You buy and race \u201cmuscle cars\u201d in the 1960s. Except, these are not professional races. Instead, you challenge drivers at the local burger joint for illegal races down Mullholland drive. I knew the magazine reviews had said quality was average, but still a decent game. It turned out to be much better than I thought it would be. Lots of emphasis is placed on upgrading your car. You have to spend your money wisely, and pick the best parts for the money. Once your car has been upgraded and modified, you drive it down to the local burger and fries joint. There, you will find a variety of other muscle cars, you can ask to look at their engine, and challenge them to a race. They may even challenge you to a race. Only drivers with cars similar or better will agree to a race. Naturally, as the game goes on, the races go for more money, and some challengers will only race for pink slips, and the game becomes serious. Obviously, losing a race at this level means the game is over. Driving simulation part was terrible. It was slow, and the graphics were poor. It reminded me of running \u201ctest drive\u201d on an old 8086 PC. Overall, good concept. I find it strange that the \u201cdriving\u201d section was so terrible. However, the \u201cupgrade\u201d and \u201cchallenge\u201d sections are well made, and easy to navigate and use. Not recommended unless you like working on cars.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "PZK", "publishers": "California Dreams", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.33", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_Rod_2", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yl0PQigYk-U&spfreload=10", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73258-street-rod-2\n"}
