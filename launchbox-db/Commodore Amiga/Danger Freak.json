{"altername_name": [], "name": "Danger Freak", "overview": "You are a stuntman and have to perform death-defying stunts, like riding a motorcycle avoiding obstacles and jumping on ramps, driving a car and jumping onto a helicopter before your car crashes against a wall, and later continue around on jetskis. Every time you mess a trick up, the scene has to be cut. If there are too many cuts, you'll lose a \"life\". Graphics aren't very good unfortunately. Sound isn't that much better: the intro tune is poor and the in-game FX aren't really anything in the way of a step up. Not Rainbow Arts' finest. A surprisingly sub-standard quality product from a company famed for raising standards.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Rainbow Arts Software", "publishers": "Rainbow Arts Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75706-danger-freak\n"}
