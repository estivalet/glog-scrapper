{"altername_name": [], "name": "Wall Defence", "overview": "Well Defence is a 1-player arcade game. The player is perched atop the ramparts of a medieval castle as enemy invaders attempt to scale the walls. The player can move horizontally, and boulders can be obtained from the far edges of the screen. The player's goal is to toss boulders down upon the enemy hordes, thus knocking them to the bottom of the castle. The player advances to a more difficult level every 200 points, and the speed which enemies ascend increases. When an enemy makes it to the top of the wall, the player is tossed to the ground, and the game is over. Goal is to maximize score.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2002", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ventzislav Tzvetkov", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQnK6P_5VWc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162859-wall-defence\n"}
