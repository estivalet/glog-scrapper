{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hannibal", "overview": "Hannibal, often subtitled Master of the Beast, is a historically accurate war strategy game first released in 1993. The game was designed by Claude Cueni for Starbyte Software. Hannibal is one of the few games that focus on the second Punic War-- you control the formidable Carthaginian army --on elephant backs-- with the ultimate goal to conquer Rome. The game is realistic in a sense that travels and sieges can, and do, take forever. Overall, an interesting game that raises the ever-controversial issue of realism vs. fun in wargames, with fun unfortunately left on the wayside as the tedium of watching your armies move kicks in again.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Starbyte Software", "publishers": "Starbyte Software", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/71431-hannibal\n"}
