{"altername_name": [], "name": "Drelbs", "overview": "In Drelbs, a set of randomly-arranged lines are already in place on the screen, and moving your character into contact with them pushes them in the direction of contact. Forming a complete square locks it into place, and it turns into a barrier. After a certain period of time, a monster may appear in a barrier which results in death if you make contact with it. After a little while the monster disappears taking the barrier with it. After producing enough squares/barriers, one will randomly change into a stairway, which can lead you into a bonus room. Making things harder are the enemies which chase your character around the screen, again contact with these results in death. This game is a free remake of the Commodore 64 game of the same name.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Simon Chin", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrRRUsfgcfU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161683-drelbs\n"}
