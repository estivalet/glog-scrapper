{"altername_name": [], "name": "BattleMech", "overview": "BattleMech, sometimes confused with another Amiga game BattleTech for the simple reason the game itself occasionally confuses the names, is a mecha strategy game that can be played up to eight players. The aim is simply to kill other players before they kill you. You first choose the mecha of your liking and then continue place it to the grid. On each turn every player must choose a series of commands to perform at the end of the turn that will be launched simultaneously, including moving to a certain direction, jumping and attacking with a variety of weapons. The trick is to estimate what the other players will do succesfully; otherwise you'll be walking straight to their attacks while your own will hit air. The game also features a \"mecha factory\" where you can create your own BattleMechs.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "November 5, 1987", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ralph Reed", "publishers": "Public Domain", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "8", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/373184-battlemech\n"}
