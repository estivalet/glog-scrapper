{"altername_name": [], "name": "Arkanoid", "overview": "The original Breakout concept involves controlling a bat at the bottom of the screen and using it to catch and direct a ball so as to hit all the bricks which are arranged at the top of the screen. It was unpopular for over a decade, before Taito revived it with some new ideas in this arcade game. The game's plot redefines the bat as a Vaus spaceship, the ball as an energy bolt, and the bricks form a mysterious wall stopping the ship from progressing to safety.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Taito", "publishers": "Discovery Software International", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.14", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkanoid", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy7Ze58irD4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/9211-arkanoid\n"}
