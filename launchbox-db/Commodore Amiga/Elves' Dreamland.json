{"altername_name": ["Elves Dreamland"], "name": "Elves' Dreamland", "overview": "A cute and colourful Xmas 2D platformer, designed just for that special time of year. Featuring 200 items to collect, a lovely Christmas tune and enemies to avoid, Elves' Dreamland was created by the map editor of Jet Set Billy, with all the graphics and music made by nittamituaki himself. But that's not all, as 7 out of 8 levels were actually based on commercial retro games such as Santa's Xmas Caper for Amiga/ DOS, Plum Duff for the ZX Spectrum and many others!", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "December 25, 2015", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "nittamituaki", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/571W6Zhq8fU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/163819-elves-dreamland\n"}
