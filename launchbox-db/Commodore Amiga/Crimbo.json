{"altername_name": [], "name": "Crimbo", "overview": "It's time for even more Christmas goodness, as if you have a Commodore Amiga at hand or an emulator installed, you might like to play this fun for all the family game of Crimbo by Spud. An unofficial ZX Spectrum to Amiga conversion of the game \"Crimbo\" by Little Shop of Pixles. Here is what Spud says about this brand new game of Crimbo for the Amiga 500 1.5MB and above : \"I did a simple and very unofficial ZX Spectrum to Amiga conversion of the game \"Crimbo\" by Little Shop of Pixles. Somewhat rushed and unoptimized in an attempt to get it out before Christmas because who wants to play a Christmas themed game after that? There are one or two things missing, maybe they'll be added for next yea, but I know it is simple both graphically and in terms of game play so I hope you enjoy! Instructions: go collect the gifts the nasty elves have stolen from Santa, etc etc. Controls are left right and fire for jump on the joystick\".", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "December 23, 2022", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Little Shop of Pixles", "publishers": "", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9xjzC7IYzU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/168101-crimbo\n"}
