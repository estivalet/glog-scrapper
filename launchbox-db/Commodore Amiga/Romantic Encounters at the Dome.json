{"altername_name": [], "name": "Romantic Encounters at the Dome", "overview": "Although the title may cause it to appear pornographic, Romantic Encounters at the Dome is actually more of a text-based adventure that journeys deep into human behavior studies. It takes place at an important social event, where you try to pick up members of the opposite sex and either get your desires quenched, or be rejected, depending on what they think of you by your social interactions. The game may feature explicit textual descriptions of sexual intercourse.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "MicroIllusions", "publishers": "MicroIllusions", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/128225-romantic-encounters-at-the-dome\n"}
