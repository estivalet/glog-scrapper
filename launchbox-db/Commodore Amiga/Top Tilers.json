{"altername_name": [], "name": "Top Tilers", "overview": "Top Tiler is an puzzle-arcade game with an idea in mind: to recreate the atmosphere of Japanese arcades we were used to see in the late '80s. The gameplay is very simple. To win, you have to move your character over the tiles in the background in order to reveal the image hidden behind them. You have to avoid the roaming enemies too or you'll lose a precious life. Some tiles have special properties. The effect these tiles produce are described at the beginning of the game. The game has 6 levels, which are divided into 4 sublevels. It has a nice ending sequence with credits too.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "4 Seasons Soft", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162108-top-tilers\n"}
