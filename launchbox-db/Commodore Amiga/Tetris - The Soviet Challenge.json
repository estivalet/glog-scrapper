{"altername_name": ["Tetris (Infogrames)"], "name": "Tetris: The Soviet Challenge", "overview": "Hey! Tetris! One of the best games in the world - the only problem being that the original Mirrorsoft version was completely and utterly useless, saved only by the unspoilable basic Tetris gameplay. Now it\u2019s been done again by Infogrames - a perfect chance to put al the wrongs right and use the power of the machine to produce what could be, quite literally, one of the best games there\u2019s ever been. It\u2019s one of the simplest games invented - surely just the laws of probability forbid it being buggered-up twice? Don\u2019t they? You know what\u2019s coming, don\u2019t you? It defies belief, it really does, but this Tetris is another disaster. What is it about Tetris that turns Amiga programmers into inept halfwits? Like I said, it\u2019s hard to mess up the basic Tetris gameplay, but the ridiculous keyboard layout on this version comes very dose to it. There\u2019s no joystick control option, so it\u2019s impossibly awkward to ever really get to grips with, and the graphics and sound aren\u2019t anything to write home about (to put it mildly). You can change the speed and put obstacles on the screen to make things tougher, which would be good if the game was playable in the first place, but that\u2019s just about all it\u2019s got going tor it. That and the pretty backdrops which you can change during the game, I guess. If you\u2019ve got amazing powers of lateral concentration, you will be able to play Tetris with this program, but it\u2019s still only a tenth as good as some of the PD versions that cost a tenth of the price, and that alone makes it worthless. Don\u2019t even think about it.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Abersoft", "publishers": "Infogrames Europe SA", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "6", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HotpXTchADo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/65787-tetris-the-soviet-challenge\n"}
