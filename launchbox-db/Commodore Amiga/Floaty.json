{"altername_name": [], "name": "Floaty", "overview": "Floaty can jump and fly around, picking up the goodies on the level while avoiding the flying things. Whenever you launch you break the platforms beneath you so you not only have the timer counting down but you have very limited real estate from which to begin your travels. You must leave yourself a place to land at the end to make it to the next level.
