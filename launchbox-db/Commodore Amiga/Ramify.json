{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ramify", "overview": "A technological remake of a 3500 year old design. A remake and update of Mancala, the transfer game, perhaps the oldest game known to man. Mancala is so widespread it is considered to be the most played game in most of Africa. Thousands of years ago, n many ancient lands, royalty and common men alike played games consisting of pits and using pebbles or jewels as playing pieces. Sometimes the games were played for high stakes, including rubies, sapphires and slaves. Ramify is based on these Mancala games. We believe you will find it as addictive as the kings and maharajahs of old found it and we have modernized it for your computer. In this version you are playing for megabytes of RAM chips.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Expert Services", "publishers": "Expert Services", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtF0t8OqTGA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162793-ramify\n"}
