{"altername_name": [], "name": "WolfPac", "overview": "WolfPac is a 3D Pacman for Amiga computers, it allows you to live the adventures of Pacman from its own perspective. It features fast, full textured 3D graphics (256 colors, any displaymode you want), lots of sounds and levels and full multitasking support. WolfPac is shareware, but the current unregistered version is not limited in any way. WolfPac should run on any Amiga with OS 3.0 (even the Draco, except for sounds) or above, a 68020 or above, 2 MB free RAM (approximately 400 KB free Chipmemory) and a displaymode with at least 320*200 Pixels in 256 colors. However a faster cpu (=68040 25 Mhz, PPC supported) and a fast graphic board are recommended (it is optimized for the usage with graphic boards). Since WolfPac 1.4 there is a special version for Amigas equiped with a PPC board from Phase 5 (or a 100% compatible one). The PowerPC version needs at least ppc.library 45.16 or higher.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gerald Schretti", "publishers": "OnLine Loop", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2r1mNQYhLk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164860-wolfpac\n"}
