In Quasarius, their formation changes slightly each level and there is only a single type of enemy ship. In the second phase, you fight a boss, a larger enemy ship. There is just a single boss type in Quasarius. Lastly, you fly through a danger zone, evading asteroids and other space debris while trying to pick up bonus points.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2017", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Raliza Software", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1FTDCHjdB8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/372235-quasarius\n"}
