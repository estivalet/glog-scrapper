{"altername_name": [], "name": "MineRunner", "overview": "Minerunner is a Lode Runner clone for up to four players. You (and friends) run around with a very small man on platforms and climb ladders collecting gold crates, while being hunted by equally small men. Defeat the enemies by digging holes in the platforms for them to fall into. The game supports four simultaneous players using a four-player adapter, supports two-button joypads (so that you can dig both behind and in front of you) and is multitasking-friendly.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Matthias Bock", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhwMNG0EZdc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164263-minerunner\n"}
