{"altername_name": ["Beyond Zork: The Coconut of Quendor"], "name": "Beyond Zork", "overview": "Role playing comes to Infocom games in Beyond Zork, in which you must set up a new character or retrieve an existing one before you can start. Quite frequently in the game, the player is attacked by one of Beyond Zork\u2019s many monsters. Apart from the high semi-random fatality rate in Beyond Zork, there are random elements in both the make-up of the map and in the placing of certain objects and creatures each time the game is played. The game is written in Interactive Fiction Plus and there are a whole lot of new features and commands at your disposal.The quest is to find the Coconut Of Cuendor. Beyond Zork is a clever combination of an Infocom text adventure with a D&D type role playing game. I am not sure that the combination works well. Nevertheless, the game is a must for all Infocom fans (the name alone should ensure that) for it is better than a number of their titles, particularly some of the more recent ones.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Infocom", "publishers": "Infocom", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyond_Zork", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/61706-beyond-zork\n"}
