{"altername_name": [], "name": "Coque & Kieagua Rally", "overview": "Coque And Kieagua Rally is a game I have made for my children which are 5 and 2 years old. It is a kids game where you have to break balloons using the car you drive. There are no lives or shots and it was even planned that there would be no game over. In recent months, the possibility of sending it to the Capacitor Party emerged and this changed the first idea a bit. Checkpoints were added and that made it possible to lose (game over) if you run out of time. Even so, the difficulty is low and it should be easy to finish the three levels that exist. The game was created by Guillermo Amat aka Dueteros. To start choose a car, a color and a character. Each vehicle has its own characteristics: The 4x4 is very slow, but it has the ability to jump very high and does better than the rest on oil spots. The Sport car has intermediate characteristics compared to the other two. The formula is very fast, jumps at low altitude and gets stuck in the oil.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2019", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Guillermo Amat", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162706-coque-kieagua-rally\n"}
