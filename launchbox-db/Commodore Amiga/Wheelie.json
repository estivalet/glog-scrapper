{"altername_name": [], "name": "Wheelie", "overview": "An unofficial port of the Spectrum original by Microsphere, created using AMOS over the course of 11 months. Your aim is to get from the left to the right of each cave where the Ghostrider waits, whom you must outrace back to the start. Along the way, you have to manage your fuel and avoid hitting any obstacles. For a game in which you ride a motorcycle, it plays out surprisingly slowly. It's more about memorizing the caves and timing your maneuvers well than about racing as fast as possible. Released on the F1 Licenceware CD-Rom Volume One F1-001 To F1-100 compilation.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Softspot", "publishers": "F1 Licenceware", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiZR1xQn8-o", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165170-wheelie\n"}
