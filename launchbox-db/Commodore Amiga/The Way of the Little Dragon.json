{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Way of the Little Dragon", "overview": "The Way of the Little Dragon or Little Dragon is a 2D versus fighting game centered around a Bruce Lee inspired character (hence the title \"Little Dragon\") who must beat a few fierce opponents just by using his kung-fu or Chinese boxing talents. A two player option is available although the Little Dragon opponents follow the one player progression path (less endurance points and cannot be picked up from a roster). The game was released in 1987 by reLINE Software and features digitized sounds inspired by the legendary Bruce Lee martial arts films and hand drawn graphics which were used as the static background of each stage, also the haunting score is not to be missed. This simple and straightforward fighting game is a joy to play for fans of the genre, even if it will probably not revolutionize the genre.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Parsec", "publishers": "Axxion", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vH5s6-tUVhA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/104811-the-way-of-the-little-dragon\n"}
