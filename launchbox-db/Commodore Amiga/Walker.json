{"altername_name": [], "name": "Walker", "overview": "The walker travels through time and space to 1944 Germany, 2019 Los Angeles, present-day Middle East (\"Tonight\"), and an unknown place in the distant future. There are two difficulty levels in the game: easy and arcade. Only the first two levels are playable on easy mode; the game will end after completing the second level, displaying a message to the player to try the much harder arcade mode. Much of the opponents are huge waves of small weak infantry, that are very small but individually animated with great detail. For example, infantry will splatter into a pool of blood when shot at.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "DMA Design", "publishers": "Psygnosis", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.08", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walker_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzmEJWjcwms", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/42553-walker\n"}
