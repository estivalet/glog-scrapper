{"altername_name": [], "name": "Summer Games II", "overview": "Eight Olympic events feature in this game, and any selection of these can be played at a time. There is no pure sprinting, and only the rowing and cycling can be thought of as pure joystick-waggling. The triple jump involves pressing right to start the hop (before reaching the white line), right again for the step as you land, left as you land for the jump, and then up to propel you through the sand. I high jump, after selecting a height you feel you can clear, you use up and down to control the speed, fire to jump, and then forward to propel you over the bar.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Creative Materials", "publishers": "U.S. Gold", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "8", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.36", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Games_II", "video_link": "https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Qaakc_4Fl68", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/43545-summer-games-ii\n"}
