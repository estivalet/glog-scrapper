It was featured on Coverdisk for ZERO computer magazine. The hero Karadoc has yet to set off on his hunt for the treasure of Wulf Castle. However, after roving Elven Slavetraders have removed his family, Karadoc sets off in search of adventure and, more importantly, filthy lucre. Rather inevitably he gets lost, equally inevitably he finds a door, and with utter inevitability he goes through it... and with a complete lack of uninevitability it slams shut behind him. Pausing long enough to have all his possessions nicked, he starts trying to find his way out. F1 : Map; a record of the rooms visited so for.
