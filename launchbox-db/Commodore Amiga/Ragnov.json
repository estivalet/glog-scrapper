{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ragnov", "overview": "Ragnov was the first game project of Softeyes in the late 1980s. A 2D sideways multi-directionally scrolling shooter. They did create a demo and sent that to several publishers, but the game never worked out and they started working on Hoi . Ragnov featured parallax scrolling and a split-screen mode for two players. The game's concept was processed into Hoi level 3 (where Hoi flies around with a jetpack on his back).", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Softeyes", "publishers": "Softeyes", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/370945-ragnov\n"}
