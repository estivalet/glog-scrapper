{"altername_name": [], "name": "Code Name Nano", "overview": "Code Name Nano from Malcolm Lavery is like a cross between Space Taxi and Thurst. The game has 2 worlds each with 10 levels. You can select either world and make several adjustments. The aim of each level is to rescue all the men that are there. Additionally you can also rescue dogs but they are secondary targets. Each level looks like a maze through which you need to guide your ship as fast as it is possible without taking any unnecessary damage. By the end of the level the remaining amount of ship's energy and time are converted to points that are stored in separate high score tables. The ship is vulnerable to wind and gravity condition that can be altered in the main menu of the game.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Malcolm Lavery", "publishers": "F1 Licenceware", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1YawagI-I", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161457-code-name-nano\n"}
