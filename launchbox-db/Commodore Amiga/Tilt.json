{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tilt", "overview": "Not to be confused with Codemasters' action-adventure game of the same name, Genias' Tilt is a fun puzzler that plays like EA's classic Marble Madness meets a pinball game. The goal is straightforward: maneuver the ball on each maze from the entrance to the exit. Along the way, though, you must avoid obstacles like magnets, traps, holes, and various other moving parts to make your task more difficult. As the name implies, you control the ball's movement by tilting the table, just like playing pinball. The game includes very comprehensive instructions, which you can access from the title screen. Overall, if you like puzzle games that emphasizes hand-eye coordination and timing (a la Tetris), give Tilt a try.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Genias", "publishers": "Genias", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73636-tilt\n"}
