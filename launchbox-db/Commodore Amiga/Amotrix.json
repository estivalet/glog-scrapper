{"altername_name": [], "name": "Amotrix", "overview": "This is another Tetris variation with some updated ideas. First there is a new object, a drop which fills five free fields in the playfield using a special algorithm. Then there is an energy bar ,which you can increase by pulling the stick down and decrement by pressing the joystick up. Meaning, the falling speed of the object is controlled by the joystick so you have very granular control of the speed at all times, as long as you have sufficient energy to control it. Finally, in two player mode when one side gets a line cleared, the other the opponent loses a field. There are 3 difficulty levels. Firing on your joystick rotates the shape. There is also a field showing the next shape up in the queue. If the game play is too fast, press H to halve the speed of the game, however, this will also halve the amount of points gained.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1997", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Chris Hodges", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfeKH5smmyM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/163590-amotrix\n"}
