{"altername_name": [], "name": "Approach Trainer", "overview": "Approach Trainer is based on A320 Airbus (Edition USA), but focuses on starting and landing the plane. This version uses the flight model of its predecessors and attempts to simulate reality as close as possible. The player can customize the flying attempts by setting a variety of options: day or night, short or long descent, weather and of course which of the 58 airports to use. Improvements in comparison to A320 Airbus (Edition USA) include optional controls with an analog joystick, improvements in graphics and flight model (e.g. the navigational tools) and a competitive two-player mode.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Rainer Bopf Software", "publishers": "Extender", "genres": "Flight Simulator", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.62", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2yZPxHNPqc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73097-approach-trainer\n"}
