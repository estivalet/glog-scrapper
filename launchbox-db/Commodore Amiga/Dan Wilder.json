{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dan Wilder", "overview": "Dan Wilder is an isometric action-adventure game, similar to Heimdall II or Cadaver. The action takes place on a Mars space base in 2998. The game begins when Dany Wilder, former policeman, is betrayed by teammates during an attack on a D-86 transporter. The mission requires finding other smugglers (James, Al, Mary) to impose the justice. The main character may move in eight directions, use items, talk with NPC's and perform minor task by doing something or providing specified items in exchange for information or useful objects. The conversation features selecting a proper dialogue option. The base, divided into a prison, communication center, mine, laboratory and nearby building is full of hostile human and cyborg inhabitants, trying to incapacitate Dan with the help of a stick or gun, and various traps, such as mines. Controlling the character requires the use of joystick and mouse (to operate the inventory).", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "TSA", "publishers": "Mirage Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75677-dan-wilder\n"}
