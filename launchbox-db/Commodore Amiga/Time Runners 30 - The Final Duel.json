{"altername_name": [], "name": "Time Runners 30: The Final Duel", "overview": "The Time Runners series was published by Simulmondo from 1993 to 1994, thanks to the will of Francesco Carl\u00e0 to create an \"interactive comic book\" with characters created ex novo especially for the series (Time Runners of the title). Simulman, the protagonist of a similar series, also appeared in an episode of this. The protagonist of the series is Max, a boy who, in the first episode of the series, gives Jessica (his girlfriend) a ring with a strange red stone. A ray of light starts from the stone, opening a portal from which two blue robots emerge, stealing the ring and kidnapping Jessica. Max reaches a friend of his, Lucas, and informs him of the situation. Lucas explains that, while testing a time machine he invented, the stone of the ring produced interference. Max uses the time machine (a scooter capable of opening temporal portals) and reaches prehistory. There he meets Bounty Killer (wearing a superhero costume) and Jack Stone (dressed in hat and raincoat like the detective of the 30s), characters who call themselves \"sentinels of time\" and give him various advice. Moreover, always in prehistoric times, it finds a futuristic base controlled by the same blue robots (called Skunks) where it discovers that, to travel in time, they use red stones (called \"spatial stones\") similar to the one on the ring.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Simulmondo", "publishers": "Simulmondo", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109937-time-runners-30-the-final-duel\n"}
