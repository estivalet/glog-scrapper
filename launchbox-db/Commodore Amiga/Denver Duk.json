{"altername_name": [], "name": "Denver Duk", "overview": "A Pengo clone from J. M. Towers in it you must connect the three diamond studded blocks in a straight line, horizontally, vertically or diagonally. This can be done by moving certain blocks around on the screen. This game was released on Amiga Format Disk 67. It is halfway between a puzzle game and a platform game. The principle is simple, you are a duck in a maze (yes, you can see this kind of thing every day), and you have to bring together three specific squares to align them. It seems easy at first, but soon you realize that it is not! And each level gets a little bit more complex than the first, giving a first class brain puzzle.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "J.M.TOWERS", "publishers": "", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3JvJNJAgDc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/163752-denver-duk\n"}
