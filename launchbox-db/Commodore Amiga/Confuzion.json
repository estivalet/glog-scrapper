This version is only 20 levels, the object on each level is to get the bomb to the drip to extinguish it. The bomb will start on one side of the screen with the drip at the bottom. You must shuffle the tiles to create a pathway to the drop. Each level has 2 time limits which are displayed as sliding bars at the bottom of the Info Panel. The top one is the time remaining before the bomb is launched and begins its movement along the pathways. You can launch the bomb earlier by clikcing R-Mouse, Fire or space. The remaining time before will be awarded to you as a bonus should you complete the level. The bottom time limit is before the bomb explodes, you can also look at the fuse for an indicator of remaining time.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Digital Wizardry", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsUF4cqxKhs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162300-confuzion\n"}
