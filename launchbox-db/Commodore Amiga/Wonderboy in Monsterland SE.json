{"altername_name": ["Wonder Boy in Monsterland SE"], "name": "Wonderboy in Monsterland SE", "overview": "The original, the fantastic platformer ' Wonder Boy ' was designed by Ryuichi Nishizawa. It started its life as a skateboard rock jumping and axe bashing platformer, that later became the adventure platformer with RPG elements ' Wonderboy in Monster Land ' that many of us know and love to this day. I myself mainly played it on the Amiga and although it was addictive as hell it suffered from being a straight Atari ST port with poor colors and long loading times. Thankfully our good friend Earok was on the case, as now he's released 'Wonderboy in Monster Land SE'; A special edition of that port. As you journey through Monster Land through twelve levels, you will need to find and defeat the dragon MEKA. You will earn gold by defeating enemies which you can spend on buying weapons, armor, shoes, magic and other useful items", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2018", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Earok", "publishers": "", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/lNOExgK-g5I", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/167106-wonderboy-in-monsterland-se\n"}
