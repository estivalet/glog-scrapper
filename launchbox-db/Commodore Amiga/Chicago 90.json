{"altername_name": [], "name": "Chicago 90", "overview": "Chicago 90 is an Action/Racing game, developed by Micro\u00efds and published by Infogrames, which was released in 1989. Choose to be a cop or a villain and get ready for the chase of your life. OK, so I lied, it\u2019s all exactly the same as the ST offering: detailed cars, nice surroundings and pleasant sound. Only problem is the game which is far too boring to play for any extended period. Ho hum. You\u2019re bound to gel some duff games when you turn out as many game as Infogrames are doing lately. It's just as well they have greats like San City, North and South, Drakkhen and Full Metal Planete to to supplement them.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Micro\u00efds", "publishers": "Micro\u00efds", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.17", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_90", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/63398-chicago-90\n"}
