{"altername_name": [], "name": "Take 'Em Out", "overview": "Take 'em Out is a typical Op Wolf clone, only more violent. Blood flows freely as you tear your way through wave after wave of terrorists and the odd civilian hostage. Before you are let out on your wave of carnage you have to qualify on the shooting range. The first of these has the standard targets flashing up to be greeted with a twelve gauge shot gun. Score the necessary amount and you are let loose in the armoury. Take 'em Out is a respectable game, good fun to play with a laughably large amount of gore. Then you finish the third level, and you get the 'Congratulations you have completed your mission\u2019 screen! If it was not for the lack of levels, Take 'em Out could be a substantially superior game to what it now is. As it stands though, it is a quick-finish gun 'em down and an expensive way to spend a commercial break.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Artronic Products", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPaY6flTznU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73570-take-em-out\n"}
