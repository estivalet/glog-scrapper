{"altername_name": [], "name": "Trolls", "overview": "This platform game features the small blue-haired cutesy creatures that were popular around the time (although surely not with most computer game buyers?). You play a Troll roaming the levels in the hope of rescuing as many baby trolls as possible - each level gives you a set minimum to retrieve before you can leave via the Pigstop. Initially you have no weapons, and contact with the nasties costs you energy, but a Yo-Yo can be collected, which can be used not only to kill enemies, but also to smash blocks away and open up paths, and even (with practice) tied to a ledge to allow you to swing across a gap.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Flair Software", "publishers": "Flair Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolls_(video_game)", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUushExBobw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/9915-trolls\n"}
