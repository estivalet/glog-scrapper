{"altername_name": [], "name": "White Butterfly", "overview": "A Shmup style shooter with a unique 8-bit, pastel color theme. Choose a fighter and wreak destruction through three pastel-shaded stages. Each fighter moves at the same speed and is only vulnerable in the cockpit (the small lozenge-shaped white section in the center). Each has three weapons, which gain power as you use them to destroy things (see the bars on the top left of the screen). When all three have reached a new level, they all power up at once - this means that you will need to balance your use of them. If your White Butterfly has its seekers at level 4 and its cannons at level 1, they'll all function at level 1. Seek harmony!
