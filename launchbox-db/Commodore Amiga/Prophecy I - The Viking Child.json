{"altername_name": [], "name": "Prophecy I: The Viking Child", "overview": "Welcome to Odin's world. A land full of good and evil, within which you must become Brian, The Viking Child, whose heroics have been foretold by the prophets and recorded in the oracle of the gods. But there's trouble in the land that you live in... Your family and friends are being held on the astral plane, imprisoned by the forces of darkness in an effort to foil the prophecy and install chaos throughout the land... As Brian, your adventure in Prophecy 1 - The Viking Child will take you through many beautiful, but dangerous places, where you'll encounter great adversaries. Amongst these will be the eight apprentices of evil, slaves to the Dark Lord Loki, who will force you to fight or question your purpose under threat of punishment or penalty. Friendly shopkeepers will sell you items of worth, that will aid you on your quest. There are sixteen levels, each with its own backgrounds, enemies, and items. There are even puzzle elements similar to Bitmap Brothers' classic Gods. Overall, a great platform/puzzle hybrid that should please all fans of the genre, not least because of the long levels you'll have to make your way through.
