{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Killing Game Show", "overview": "The Killing Game Show is a run and gun shooter game developed by Raising Hell Software for the Amiga and Atari ST. It was released in 1990 and published by Psygnosis. It was re-released later under the name Fatal Rewind for the Sega Genesis and published by Electronic Arts. The music and sound effects for the game were created by Ray Norrish. The main character of the game later made cameos in Leander and Wiz 'n' Liz. This game is a mixture between platformer and shoot'em up. It looks very similar to the popular computer video game Turrican. Apart from avoiding or shooting enemies moving in different patterns you must make your way from the bottom up to the level exit because after a few seconds toxic liquid will start to rise. At the beginning of each level you may display a map by pressing the Help key (Amiga version). You can jump, run, climb walls and use special weapons or items (keys to open certain gates) to master different sections of these levels. After you lose one life you see a replay and be able to continue at any point by pushing the fire button. You can fast-forward the replay by holding the F10 key. This was a unique and convenient feature because like other Psygnosis titles the game has a high degree of difficulty. The Amiga and Atari ST versions consisted of 8 levels separated into two parts each. The Genesis version was published as Fatal Rewind and had 6 levels divided into two parts each.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Raising Hell Software", "publishers": "Psygnosis", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.36", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Killing_Game_Show", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/23915-the-killing-game-show\n"}
