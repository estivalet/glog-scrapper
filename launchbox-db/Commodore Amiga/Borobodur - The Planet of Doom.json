{"altername_name": [], "name": "Borobodur: The Planet of Doom", "overview": "Borobodur: The Planet of Doom is an Action game, developed by Softeyes and published by Thalamus, which was released in Europe in 1992. As a platform and blast adventure, you must progress through all levels by collecting the various icons scattered at the most inconvenient of places. Who put the required object on a platform that demands a super-hyper jump from a dangerously high-up ledge? It's not all run, jump and shoot, though. Sub-levels include a puzzle game against the computer where you shuffle square blocks about a board in an attempt to recreate the original pattern. There's also a turbo bike section, featuring an Outrun/Lotus perspective. Final words: Frustratingly slow and tedious with minimal action.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Softeyes", "publishers": "Thalamus", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.6", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/63015-borobodur-the-planet-of-doom\n"}
