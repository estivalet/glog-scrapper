{"altername_name": [], "name": "Fracas", "overview": "Fracas is a Mech Fighter from Casco/John Smith on the Amiga. It says in the readme this took 3 years to make. Basically you have to search down the enemy/ies and destroy them on each generated level. The game also offers a 2 player mode but suggest you use something to split the screen to stop your opponent cheating. You do have a selection of different mechs too. This is a nice game I have only just discovered 28 years later.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Casco Software", "publishers": "", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpVqxdg5-wo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162448-fracas\n"}
