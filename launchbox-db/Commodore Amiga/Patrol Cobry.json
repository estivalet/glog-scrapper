{"altername_name": [], "name": "Patrol Cobry", "overview": "Patrol Cobry is a timed puzzle-solving game. The player takes control of a chopper and moves blocks in the devastated by earthquake city to gain access to medical laboratory base in search for a cure for the outbreak. The blocks have been contaminated and must be properly neutralized. The neutralization is done by dropping a block from a height to another block of the same color. The combined blocks are changing to green and cannot be moved again. The pilot may use of two additional objects to neutralize the contaminated blocks: bombs (destroying the object underneath) and two types of transformers (neutralizing side blocks or side and bottom blocks). The pilot must avoid a chemical gas and toxic drops, damaging the engine of the chopper. The passage of time is represented in the form of fuel consumption. The fuel can be supplemented by collecting the oil containers. After earning 20 thousand points the player receives an additional helicopter. Patrol Cobry includes two additional mini games: Pionier - an enhanced clone of classic Minesweeper, with the difficulty levels in the form of military ranks and the possibility of switching off and on the time indicator and the scanner machine. Skoczek - a puzzle board game, where the player must cover the board by moving the chess horse figure and standing only once on each field.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atares", "publishers": "Atares", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gj-O54VMOc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161625-patrol-cobry\n"}
