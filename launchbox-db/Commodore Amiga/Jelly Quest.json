{"altername_name": [], "name": "Jelly Quest", "overview": "A game much like Q-Bert, in that you control a blobby Jelly wotsit who has to leap around tiles, turning them from red into green, the trick is that there are loads of different types of tiles: some turn all the surrounding tiles green, some swap between the two colors every time you leap on them while others remain green; some explode if you stay on them too long; others automatically make you jump in a certain direction. The puzzles are ingeniously worked out and incredibly addictive. A short version was released on PD, while the full version was released as shareware.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "David McGuire", "publishers": "", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usgWsxEUBp0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162354-jelly-quest\n"}
