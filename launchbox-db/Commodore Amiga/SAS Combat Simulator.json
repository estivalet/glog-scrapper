{"altername_name": [], "name": "SAS Combat Simulator", "overview": "This action game is similar to Konami\u2019s arcade game Green Beret. It scrolls from left to right, and the levels include ladders and platforms. A constant stream of enemies face you, and can be dispatched with either your machine gun, or one of your limited (but replenishable) supply of grenades. The Codemasters logo appears liberally in the game, representing a variety of bonus items. These include jeeps and tanks which give you much more protection, and smart bombs and rapid fire.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Optimus Software", "publishers": "Codemasters Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/102073-sas-combat-simulator\n"}
