{"altername_name": [], "name": "Amnios", "overview": "Amnios is a multi-directionally scrolling top down shoot 'em up set across ten levels, each representing a planet whose eco-system has been infected. The controls involved thrusting and rotating, similarly to Asteroids. There are two ways to successfully complete the level - destroy enough of the infection to allow the planet to survive, or rescue enough of the citizens, Defender-style. For each of the organs to be destroyed, a specific weapon can be created to cleanse it easier - blueprints must be collected and taken back to your ship for this.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Flying Chicken Software", "publishers": "Psygnosis", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnios", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/23845-amnios\n"}
