{"altername_name": [], "name": "Harry\u2019s Balloons", "overview": "Harry is a hedgehog and his job is to literally mess about with his balloons. Okay, so hedgehogs and balloons may not live next to each other in perfect harmony but, so what - it's only a computer game. Harry's Balloons is a sporting challenge where the idea is to continually make decisions which have to be backed up by the skill of the joystick. In this game instead of popping balloons, you must stop them from popping and collect them up by color. Throughout the game you will also be awarded bonuses which range from magic disks and color worms. There are three modes of play, each one completely different to the next. You can have six players in the competition tournament which I suppose is a bit like a league. There's also the knockout tournament whereby every losing player is obviously eliminated, and finally there's the pick-a-round stage where you can choose your favourite stage.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Collide", "publishers": "Collide Design", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "6", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/163911-harrys-balloons\n"}
