{"altername_name": [], "name": "Kill Em All", "overview": "With graphics inspired by Alien\u00b3, this 1997 shareware game from Muzzasoft's Alastair Murray and Ben Wyatt is shooter that had a lot of effort put into it and it shows. A decade earlier this could have been a boxed release. Kill em all is a precursor to Countdown to extinction, which is a precursor to Traitor. If you registered the game for 6 UK Pounds, then you got more levels from the author. The original version was likely from 1993, but we only have the date of the final updates and release.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Muzzasoft", "publishers": "Muzzasoft", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44bmLQF8NaQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164104-kill-em-all\n"}
