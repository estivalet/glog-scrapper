{"altername_name": [], "name": "Burntime", "overview": "Deserts cover the globe, cities are destroyed, the end of every civilization is near. The few survivors search for drinking water and food. They eat all they can find. Like a Role-Playing-Game, you travel through the world and meet many computer-played characters. You want to rule the world. But there are other 3 characters with the same aim. You spend the most game time looking at the map, which takes up several screens. The position of the 4 characters, their occupied conquests, the cities, and the health condition of your character are shown on the map. The different settlements you can occupy are old factories, camping-grounds or ruins of old mega-cities. The five great cities are opened for all competitors and can\u2019t be occupied. In these cities you cannot fight against your enemies. Sometimes you meet a human for changing news, items or take them in your party. There are different classes of computer-characters: fighters, engineers or doctors for example. Every character of your party can carry up to 6 items (food, weapons). These items are produced by the settlements you control.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Max Design GesMBH", "publishers": "Max Design GesMBH", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.33", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burntime", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73854-burntime\n"}
