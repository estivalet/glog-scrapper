{"altername_name": [], "name": "Crazy Pipe", "overview": "A game of strategy and reflexes by Joe Rumsey. A Pipe Dream clone where you need to avoid spilling any water for as long as possible. Use the mouse to place sections of pipe on the board so that the water has somewhere to flow. The water flows from the S (source) and can be sped up by hitting the F key. In this version cross pieces can be used with great safety, if there is pipe on the other side water will not flow through the unused ends.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Joe Rumsey", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Byt73cUHlNk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/163755-crazy-pipe\n"}
