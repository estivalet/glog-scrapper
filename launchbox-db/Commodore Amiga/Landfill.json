{"altername_name": [], "name": "Landfill", "overview": "Landfill is written in C and features music from EAB's very own saimon69. Landfill is a little like Tetris or Columns but with its own unique gameplay. Here, you have a chain of household items. You remove items by matching them with the next item in the chain. As the game progresses, new items appear and it becomes a rapid memory game. You can use the fire button to swap with items to the left or right.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2019", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Clebin Games", "publishers": "", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q43TFscqnQs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161092-landfill\n"}
