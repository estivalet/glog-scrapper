{"altername_name": ["Sam and Max Xmas Demo"], "name": "Sam and Max Xmas", "overview": "WARNING THIS GAME CONTAINS CRUDE HUMOUR & IS NOT INTENDED FOR CHILDREN OR ANYONE EASILY OFFENDED. It is a text adventure with some graphics for the Holiday Season. This little game has been put together for the First Annual Festive Amiga Games Competition. The game itself is based on Telltale Games' Sam & Max Nearly Save Christmas and Ice Station Santa. It uses backgrounds and sprites downscaled from Telltale's concept art and the Lucasarts title Sam & Max Hit the Road. Sam and Max themselves are the creation of Steve Purcell. Enjoy and don't judge the game too harshly as it was put together in a holiday rush and wrapped up in a bow for you to enjoy. MERRY CHRISTMAS TO ALL!!", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2009", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Philski", "publishers": "", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165042-sam-and-max-xmas\n"}
