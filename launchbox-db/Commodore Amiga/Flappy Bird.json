{"altername_name": [], "name": "Flappy Bird", "overview": "Flappy Bird is a straight clone of Flappy Bird for smartphones, itself based on many a one-button game. You let your bird flap its wings by pressing the space key, the mouse button or the joystick button, making sure you stay in the air without colliding with the pipes entering the screen from above and below. One thing this version has over the original is some really great music by Sten Lysholm Larsen.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "March 6, 2014", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Michael Gibs", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pTvFzuFgbY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162294-flappy-bird\n"}
