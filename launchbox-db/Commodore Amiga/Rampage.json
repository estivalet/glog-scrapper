Following this, the three of them plan to go round destroying buildings, and up to 3 human players can join in. Smashing at the edges of the buildings for long enough will make them collapse.

You will need to eat regularly, with things like plants on offer, to avoid shrinking back to being human", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Monarch Development", "publishers": "Activision", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "3", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.28", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rampage_%28video_game%29", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPvzRLjKOZE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/9163-rampage\n"}
