{"altername_name": [], "name": "Blake Stone: Aliens of Gold", "overview": "The precursor to Blake Stone: Planet Strike also released for the Amiga in 2017. Aliens of Gold, the first game in the Blake Stone series, pits the space-age British secret agent against Dr. Pyrus Goldfire; a madman bent on world domination. Using a mastery of genetic engineering and a tremendous reserve of wealth, Dr. Goldfire intends to unleash a mutant army upon the Earth. The first chapter begins in Goldfire's S.T.A.R. Institute headquarters building. Each level has Blake fighting through guards to find an elevator keycard for the next level. Dr. Goldfire will personally appear along the way to fire shots at Blake, and his genetic creations also pose a tough challenge. Each chapter lasts 10 levels, and brings Blake closer to reaching Goldfire, only to have the mad doctor escape to a new installation in his network, and the start of a new chapter.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2017", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "JAM Productions", "publishers": "", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTq6wfWo2Is", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161869-blake-stone-aliens-of-gold\n"}
