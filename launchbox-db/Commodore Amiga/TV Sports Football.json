{"altername_name": ["TV Sports: Football"], "name": "TV Sports Football", "overview": "Before Electronic Arts sought to imitate television coverage of sports with their EA Sports titles, Cinemaware had the same idea, initially applying it to (American) Football. Cutscenes follow dramatic moments in the match, and each match is preceded by a TV-style introduction. The game is primarily action-based, although you also choose your plays before executing them. You then bring the passes and runs to life on the pitch itself. You can play single matches or full leagues, with any of the NFL teams of the time.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Cinemaware", "publishers": "Cinemaware", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "28", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/44974-tv-sports-football\n"}
