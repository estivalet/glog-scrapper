To do this he must blow bubbles to catch the grubs that they feed on and guide them through the level by blowing on them or nudging them past any obstacles in the way to the nest where T'yungunz live. To complete a level, you must make sure that a certain number of T'yungunz are fully fed so they go to sleep. If they don't get enough food then eventually they die.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "The Big Red Software Company", "publishers": "Codemasters", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steg_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/uEDnBmPAEPc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/71999-steg-the-slug\n"}
