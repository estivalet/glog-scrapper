The program uses phonics to teach children letter and word recognition, that is to say all words used sound as they spell. A picture of the word to spell appears on the screen and the child then has to spell the word by clicking with the mouse on the alphabet displayed. Correct spelling is rewarded by a pleasant tune and a congratulations message.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Soft Stuff", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/167103-spell-book\n"}
