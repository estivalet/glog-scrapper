{"altername_name": [], "name": "Masterblazer", "overview": "Masterblazer is both a remake of and a follow-up to the Lucasfilm Games game Ballblazer. Ballblazer is a futuristic sport played in vehicles called \"Rotofoils\". The play field is a large rectangle made out of squares. The object of the game is to get a ball called \"Plasmorb\" into the goal, which moves along the edge of the play field. Otherwise, the rules are simple: \"Three minutes, two players, one victor!\" The game is played in first-person on a split screen and can be played by either one or two players. Compared to Ballblazer, Masterblazer offers two new playing options: a Tournament Mode and a Rotofoil Race.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Infernal Byte Systems", "publishers": "Rainbow Arts Software GmbH", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.83", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masterblazer", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/-K2ihEZh9Os", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83443-masterblazer\n"}
