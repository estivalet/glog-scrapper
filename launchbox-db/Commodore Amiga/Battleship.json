{"altername_name": ["Battle Ships", "Battleships"], "name": "Battleship", "overview": "What can you add to Battleship over the pencil and paper version? A computerized opponent, fairly obviously, as well as the chance to play without using up the earth\u2019s limited paper and pen resources. The possibility of cheating is removed as well. Elite go beyond this by changing the shapes of the ships to be more Tetris style, and allowing these to be placed at each of the 4 main angles. A \u2018Salvo Fire\u2019 mode sees each player fire a succession of shots (each of your six ships gets four shots a turn until it\u2019s sunk), meaning that strategic play involves firing on a wide range initially in the hope of finding a ship, before homing in on the area in the next turn. Finally, there\u2019s an animated sequence for each go, which is depicted as an air strike. As well as standard two-player games, there\u2019s also a multi-player mode in which the winner\u2019s score accumulates until he loses, allowing for a \u201cwinner stays on\u201d structure if there are 3 or more of you.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Elite Systems", "publishers": "Elite Systems", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.94", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleships_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBgV9DEFcnk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/45422-battleship\n"}
