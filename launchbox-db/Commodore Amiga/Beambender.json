{"altername_name": [], "name": "Beambender", "overview": "And after a decent weekend's bender this is one game I wouldn't be playing come Monday morning. All your faculties need to be in tip-top form for a bout of Beambender - your mind must be clear and your hand can't be shaking. The basic premise of the game is this: you have a cannon (though there could be more, depending on the level) that periodically fires a beam of coloured light, the colour depending on the colour of the cannon. This beam of light needs to be directed towards the colour coded exit through a series of mirrors and other gadgets, and all of this needs to be done within a strict time limit. With some 80 levels this is going to really test you, because they start getting difficult from as early as level three onwards. Be prepared for a serious cerebral workout. The layouts are usually clever enough to give you a good challenge without having to break of and deal with the pests every couple of seconds and this, for me, took some of the shine off an otherwise splendid game.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Blue Lemon Studio", "publishers": "Verkosoft Publishing", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/74929-beambender\n"}
