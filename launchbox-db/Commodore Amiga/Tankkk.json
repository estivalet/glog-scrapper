{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tankkk", "overview": "A multi-player party tank game from the author of HippoPlayer for 2 to 4 players. The game can be downloaded from Aminet Created by Kari-Pekka Koljonen, T. Lindstr\u00f6m, and J. P\u00e4ij\u00e4nen of Hippopotamus Design in 1996. Tankkk does nothing more than turn your (once) powerful Amiga into an Atari 2600. Moving tanks around a monochrome screen will be a familiar first gaming memory to many so perhaps Tankkk taps into a node of gaming nostalgia. Up to five players can enter the maze and shoot at each other, making the game a must for gatherings. Although not recommended as a Christmas Day family pursuit it's perfect for beer drinking sessions with friends. There are a couple of different mazes and a number of settings to tweak the game. The main reason why Tankkk is so good is that bullets bounce off walls. This seemingly simple feature expands the game's potential greatly since bullets can affect parts of the area away from the tank's immediate vicinity. Thus an arena with five players soon becomes extremely hectic.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hippopotamus Design", "publishers": "", "genres": "Party", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSlW9SMmyn8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164689-tankkk\n"}
