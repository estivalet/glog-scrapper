{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mission Elevator", "overview": "A bomb has been set by terrorists to blow up a sky-scraping hotel in which the FBI\u2019s Central Intelligence Unit is located, and you must diffuse it. Reaching the room itself is no easy task, as the hotel is split into segments of 8 floors, and you can\u2019t move onto the next one without the emergency key, which the porter has hold of \u2013 he must be located. Each of these has one eighth of the secret stop code, and these must be entered in order to finally diffuse the bomb. Secrets can be gleaned from the opposing hijackers, and from the barman. In some cases furniture can be used to your advantage. The whole game is similar to Impossible Mission, requiring lots of logic, puzzle-solving and structured thought.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Eurogold", "publishers": "Axxiom", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXcm13mNudw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/74497-mission-elevator\n"}
