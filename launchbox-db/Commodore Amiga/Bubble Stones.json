{"altername_name": ["BubbleStones v2"], "name": "Bubble Stones", "overview": "Bubblestones is a game by Guy Maysonnave, several versions were released with the most common being BubbleStones v1.4 and BubbleStones v2.0. They are the same game with only minor modifications. The goal of BubbleStones is to clear all the Bubbles from 25 different levels before they touch your base. When you connect 3 stones of the same color, they disappear and in doing so they remove any stones that were connected below them. At the beginning of each level you start with 1999 points and the countdown starts. A destroyed stone brings back 10 points, a stone which falls 50 points, a bonus clock gives 200 points. All these are added to the meter and at the end of the level what is there will be added to your score or withdrawn if the number is in the negatives. You can continue past the 25th level at a faster pace.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1997", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Guy Maysonnave", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fs-TNPDEs8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/163716-bubble-stones\n"}
