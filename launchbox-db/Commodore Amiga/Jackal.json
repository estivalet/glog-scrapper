{"altername_name": [], "name": "Jackal", "overview": "Jackal is a port created by Neeso for the Commodore Amiga. This is a remake of the NES top-down shooter of the same name, graphically enhanced to take advantage of the Amiga (OCS-ECS) hardware. The enemy army has captured too many of your forces. Being held in P.O.W. camps, these soldiers are effectively out of the war... unless some kind of rescue operation can be mounted. Heavy Forces are too slow and visible to be of any use, but perhaps something smaller and lighter may make it in where larger forces would fail. A small jeep, maybe two, crewed by about 4 people.... minimal enough not to represent too much of a loss and yet suitable enough to aid in rescue. But of course, if these brave men want to succeed AND come back alive; they'll need to fight like animals... they'll need to fight like jackals... Jackal is an overhead view jeep game for up to 2 players. Your mission is to locate facilities where soldiers are being held prisoner, rescue as many as possible, and escort them to a safe landing zone where they will be air transported away. After that, you'll need to fight a boss battle against the enemy to progress.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "January 20, 2022", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "", "developers": "Neeso", "publishers": "", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QobvUJrNqPw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/158457-jackal\n"}
