{"altername_name": [], "name": "Star Trek: The Game Of The Future Of Mankind", "overview": "The main goal in the game is to receive mission calls from Starfleet Command and execute them, as they get gradually more difficult. Missions consist mostly along the lines of \"Take some high ranking yo-yo from this backwater planet to that backwater planet\". Occasionally you will be asked to protect a planet from the canal water sucking enemies of all that is good and decent in space, the Romulans and the Klingons. Main game play begins with you sitting in the main bridge in the central chair of Captain James T. Kirk. Ahead of you is the main view screen with the limitless void of space beyond it, and the back of your Helmsman and Navigator's heads. From here you may call up and use any station and crew member at the Captain's disposal. A click on the science station will have Spock's valuable yet somewhat predictable logic and advice on anything that comes up in the game; anything from Ion storms and other space anomalies to how to deal with enemies (which you end up killing anyway). From here you have control of the impulse and warp engines, the alert status (red alert, yellow alert, yada yada yada), shield levels, everything. Your communication station keeps you in touch with Starfleet's missions and gives you communication access to any planet you visit and any ships you encounter, friend or foe.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "AGATron", "publishers": "AGATron", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/128254-star-trek-the-game-of-the-future-of-mankind\n"}
