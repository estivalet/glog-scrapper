{"altername_name": [], "name": "Nobunaga's Ambition", "overview": "Essentially Romance of The Three Kingdoms with Japan as a backdrop, the game chronicles the achievements of Oda Nobunaga, a shrewd daimyo who came close to the ultimate title of shogun in one of the most prosperous and tumultuous periods in Japanese history. Play as Nobunaga himself or one of his rivals for a greater challenge. This is not as difficult as RTK games because there are fewer territories to conquer, but still very engrossing due to its emphasis on RPG-style character traits and 'realistic' personnel management. Definitely a must play for any KOEI fan and an interesting historical wargame for anyone interested in Japanese history, or how crucial your generals' loyalty is in the thick of war.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Koei", "publishers": "Koei", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "8", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobunaga%27s_Ambition", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcXr8ilVZ6w", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72575-nobunagas-ambition\n"}
