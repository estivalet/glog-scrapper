{"altername_name": [], "name": "Amegas", "overview": "Amegas is a Breakout variant which conforms to, and expands on the play mechanics of the established Arkanoid canon. The basic lay remains to control a bat which slides back and forth at the bottom of the screen. Stacks of coloured bricks are arranged in patterns above. The object is being to bounce a ball to hit the bricks to make them disappear. Some bricks\u2019 require multiple hits to destroy - visually indicated by dots shown on the face. Some special bricks are distinguished from others by unique icons, e.g. one with a\u2019 skull\u2019 will result in a loss of life if hit by the ball, or one with an \u2018x\u2019 mark will cause new bricks to spawn & spread. At times bricks will yield colour-coded pickups which topple down and may be caught, resulting in a special power-up feature being given. A unique play facet presented here is that power-ups\u2019 are not activated automatically, but rather are reserved - The player may utilise the last power-up collected upon clicking the right mouse button, this remains true even if a ball is lost.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "reLINE Software", "publishers": "DigiTek", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.58", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amegas", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HhDddgWTHg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73837-amegas\n"}
