{"altername_name": [], "name": "T Tec Maze", "overview": "A licenseware maze game created by Trevor Taylor and released in 1991. The piece of software has been designed with a competition in mind. To reach the exit you must alter the maze by moving over switches which are circles of 1,2,4 or 6 colors. Each time you land on a switch, all the gates of the same color will move. In later levels some of the gates will take on false colors to make things more interesting.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Trevor Taylor", "publishers": "Deja Vu Licenceware", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxRn5NMBgrk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164731-t-tec-maze\n"}
