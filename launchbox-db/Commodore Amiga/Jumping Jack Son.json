{"altername_name": ["Jumping Jackson", "Jumping Jack'Son"], "name": "Jumping Jack Son", "overview": "Jumping Jack'Son is a top-down puzzle game. Jackson hops around a game board, picking up records (anyone remember vinyl?) and putting them down on record players. Each record carries one instrument's part of a tune, and as the records are put down, the tune builds up. Once all the records are spinning, the tune and level are completed. Blocking your way are a variety of violent musical instruments - violins, trumpets, bass drums.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Infogrames", "publishers": "Infogrames", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.19", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLhaigSiJZI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/71942-jumping-jack-son\n"}
