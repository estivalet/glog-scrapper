{"altername_name": ["JetPilot"], "name": "Jet Pilot", "overview": "The closest most of us get to plane is once a year in the summer, with suitcases and suntan lotion and the worry if you remembered to switch everything off. Now Vulcan Software give you the chance to sit behind the steering wheel of a virtual plane, and worry about air temperature and fog instead. And more. The tagline \u2018The Pinnacle of Realistic Flight Simulation\u2019 is wholly appropriate, because JetPilot is a really is a simulation, and not a game. Using the mouse or an analogue joystick, you are bundled into the cockpit of the aircraft of your choice, and are free to fly around the simulated airspace of 27 different airfields in Europe. The real challenge, however, is to qualify for combat missions by passing your training. Of course, all this realism comes at a price, and it\u2019s in the hardware. JetPilot is the most ambitious flight simulator ever attempted on the Amiga, and apart from the speed issues, it does the job well. However, how much entertainment you\u2019ll get out of it depends on how much effort \u2013 and hardware - you put into it, and how often you\u2019ve lusted about driving your own killing machine around the skies. This is a complete and comprehensive simulation. Plenty to do and learn; plane buffs will have a field day.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Vulcan Software", "publishers": "Vulcan Software", "genres": "Flight Simulator", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tM1SMPCozWU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/71993-jet-pilot\n"}
