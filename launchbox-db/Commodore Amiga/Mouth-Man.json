{"altername_name": ["Mouth Man"], "name": "Mouth-Man", "overview": "Mouth-Man is another good Pacman-clone, Written by Matthew J Barker in November 1991, This one has a variety of different levels, and the usual sounds you would expect, The Eating-Dots Sounds, The Eating Ghost Sounds, and Power Pellet Pickup Sounds, which are well done and feel nice and polished. There are Extra Bonuses, such as Ghost Peeler which Skins the Ghosts, Extra Power Pill, Ghost Repellent, Invincibility, Extra Live and even Goto Next Level which is rare. This allows 2 players gameplay as well, But not at the same time, unlike the Pacman (Kari) version which I recently reviewed, There are the normal standard Tunnels on this game, making you catapult to the opposite side of the level map, hopefully avoiding the Ghosts When you first start, The first level plays slower than the others, I guess this was to slowly introduce you into the game, and the speed restriction appears to be lifted from Level 2 onwards. There are the usual 4 Ghosts, Pink is the fastest, Red always tends to follow you closely, so be aware of him, Cyan does not want to come near you much, and Orange who is really slow, and practically an easy pushover. There are 12 levels included, well it was released as Shareware after all, and there is a Maze Editor,", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "November 1, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Matthew J.
