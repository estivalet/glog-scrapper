{"altername_name": [], "name": "Baldies", "overview": "The premise of Baldies is similar to many real-time strategy games. You start with a limited number of Baldies with which you construct buildings, increase your population, and create the necessary instruments of war. There are four classes of Baldies--builders, scientists, soldiers, and workers/breeders. Structures include small, medium, large, and huge houses as well as science labs and barracks. Each building has specific properties that assist in your destruction of the enemy. Baldies originally started as a project intended for the Amiga platforms, but despite becoming a small hit for a number of platforms and later followed by a sequel \"Skullcaps\", it was never released for Amiga. A beta version from 1993 is the only version ever seen on the platform.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Creative Edge Software", "publishers": "", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/160717-baldies\n"}
