{"altername_name": [], "name": "Robozone", "overview": "Robozone is a three-part arcade game, divided into a platform section, a 3D maze section and a horizontally-scrolling shoot-'em-up. Now there's nothing inherently wrong with the multiple-subgames style, but each of the three mini games is as thin and dull as the ones found here. Everyone here has found the platform sequence tedious within 30 seconds, the middle game is simply atrocious, and the last section, a fairly presentable R-Typeish blaster, is unlikely to be reached by anyone other than the most bloody-minded, making it a bit of a waste of time. The bottom line: excellent in-game music, but a tired, uneventful and repetitive game that more or less completely fails to provide any decent entertainment whatsoever after the neat front end sequence.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Arc Developments", "publishers": "Image Works", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX6xLJuKrpo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72815-robozone\n"}
