The aim of the game is to pass through a series of chambers collecting the pods which will appear at random around the screen. However, as you attempt to do this the chamber walls will advance upon you, absorbing the pods as they move.You can shoot at the walls to force them to retreat but as they move back will erase the pods behind them. It is possible to drag back some of the walls, but once again the pods will disappear as the walls are pulled back.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Addictive Games", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DHQO2_s3ZU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/69685-hyperforce\n"}
