{"altername_name": [], "name": "Arcade Snooker", "overview": "Arcade Snooker is a Sports game, developed by Team17 and published by CU Amiga, which was released in Europe in 1995. Using the game engine from Arcade Pool, Team17 recreate the more complex game of snooker. The viewpoint is still from above, although the balls remain the same size on screen, eliminating any feeling of the table being larger than a pool table. The control system is identical to Arcade Pool, involving setting the speed before using the left button to position the shot and the right to shoot. The rules of snooker are fully recreated, other than the precise complicated miss rule. There are lots of computer opponents available, as well as a two-player mode.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Team 17 Software Limited", "publishers": "CU Amiga", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/61635-arcade-snooker\n"}
