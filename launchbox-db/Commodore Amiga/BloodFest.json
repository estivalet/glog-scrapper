{"altername_name": [], "name": "BloodFest", "overview": "Since Bloodfest is freeware, Mellow Chips didn't have to worry about distributor censorship and anti-violence laws. This is one of the most gruesome games on the Amiga. You awake from hypersleep aboard a space station. The whole crew has been turned into horrifying, deformed monsters. The scenario and the graphics are probably inspired by Doom, the game mechanics are a simplified version of Dungeon Master. While the atmosphere is great, my complaint about Bloodfest is that it plays a bit too simple. Without a proper inventory and detailed character statistics, there isn't much to do in this game apart from finding an occasional keycard and - of course - killing the abominations roaming the corridors of the forsaken space station.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Mellow Chips", "publishers": "Mellow Chips", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75069-bloodfest\n"}
