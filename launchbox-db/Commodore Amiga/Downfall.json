{"altername_name": [], "name": "Downfall", "overview": "Downfall for Amiga is a game, based upon homebrew title for the Atari Jaguar, which itself was inspired by an Atari 2600 game called Man Goes Down. As you will have gathered, it's a very simple platform affair but one based on falling, rather than jumping. As the platforms scroll up, your task is to stay on the screen without getting squished at the top, or falling to your doom at the bottom. Although a basic concept (one livened up slightly with the addition of bonuses) it's a surprisingly tricky and compulsive idea that had me coming back for 'one more go' on an alarming number of occasions. Amiga version adds two player game option and a couple of power-ups.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "May 27, 2012", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Remainder", "publishers": "Remainder", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "http://downfall.mikendezign.com", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90188-downfall\n"}
