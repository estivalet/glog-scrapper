{"altername_name": ["Spider"], "name": "JP Spider", "overview": "Spider is a game of patience which uses two regular decks of playing cards. The tableau consists of ten columns of cards, initially with 44 cards face down with a row of 10 cards face up on top. Spider Game Screen The object of the game is to manipulate the cards to assemble complete suits with the king at the base of the pile and the ace at the top. When a complete suit is assembled it can be removed from play. The game is won if all eight suits are removed. Cards are moved from the top of columns, either individually, or in groups. The cards are then placed on other columns in decending order, regardless of suit. The top card of any column is available to move, while groups of cards can only be moved if they are a descending run of the same suit. Features Spider is fully configurable with all of the following items changable within the program: Screen Mode and Size Screen Font Card Set Card Back Card Sets may be edit using any paint program and converted using the make_cards program which is available seperately.
