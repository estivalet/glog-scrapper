{"altername_name": [], "name": "Last Action Hero", "overview": "The Amiga game based on the 1993 Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle Last Action Hero is a side-scrolling brawler in the vein of Double Dragon or Final Fight. The player controls action hero Jack Slater through five levels, including the streets, a warehouse, Slater's home and more. He must beat up a number of thugs with a variety of punches and kicks, a somersault, or a knee to the groin, all while slowly moving to the end of the level. Up to four goons will attack at the same time. In the later levels, some are armed with guns. At the end of each level a boss fight against a more powerful villain follows. These include the main antagonists from the movie like Benedict and Slater's arch enemy the Ripper, but also some characters thought up for the game only. Most of them don't play fair and will have some regular thugs coming to their aid. Slater starts the game with a limited number of lives, which can be increased by picking up golden movie tickets lying about in trash cans or other containers. Sound-wise the game features a sample of Arnold's famous one-liner \"I'll be back\" and guitar-heavy rock tracks as music.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "The Dome Software Developments", "publishers": "Psygnosis", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.7", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/91857-last-action-hero\n"}
