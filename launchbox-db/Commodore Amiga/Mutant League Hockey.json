{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mutant League Hockey", "overview": "Mutant League Hockey is a violent hockey game in the same series as Mutant League Football. There are 23 bizarre hockey teams to choose from, with players consisting of zombies, skeletons, trolls, and robots. The arenas are equally strange, with hidden bottomless pits, mines placed under the ice, spikes, and a \"Demon Net\" that functions as a goalie by chomping up and down and devouring the puck. The game plays similar to normal hockey, except in this game your players can pick up chainsaws, maces, axes, etc. to use against the competition. It's a bloody game, with opponents exploding into piles of goo (or circuits if they are a robot) when they become too injured. The player can call special plays, like an exploding puck or jail break and attack the goalie. The game also has fighting sequences if two players decide to get into a brawl. The game comes with multiplayer and a playoff series, full stats for your players and instant replays.
