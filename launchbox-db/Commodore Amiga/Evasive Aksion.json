{"altername_name": [], "name": "Evasive Aksion", "overview": "A puzzle-platform shareware game by C. Dire, released in 1994. Collect the gems and avoid the robots. We find our hero, Yao, trapped in a dream in which he finds himself traveling through a crazy world, which includes futuristic settings inhabited by droids, to ancient settings occupied by mummies (who are surprisingly swift and flexible in their movements). At first, Yao is pleasantly surprised to find that there are enormous diamonds just waiting to be collected. Unfortunately, Yao's dream is not as straight-forward as it first appears... The inhabitants of this world are actually there to protect the diamonds and give out harsh punishments (namely death) to those caught trying to steal them. Rather than risking his welfare, Yao could forget about the diamonds (and his greed) - but in the strange way that dreams are, he realizes that collecting the diamonds is his only means of escape from this crazy world... * PLAYING EVASIVE AKSION * Yao starts the game with; 2 lives 1 Drill 1 Transporter (called TSPTR in game) You must guide Yao around each level collecting the diamonds. On the way you must be careful to avoid the baddies who guard them. As well as using the ladders to travel between platforms you can also use DRILLS/TRANSPORTERS. A level is completed when you have collected all the diamonds. However you gain a bonus if you collect them in a certain order.
