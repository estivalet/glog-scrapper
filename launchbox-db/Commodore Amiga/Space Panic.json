{"altername_name": [], "name": "Space Panic", "overview": "A remake of the famous early platform game that hit the arcades in 1980, this 1990 remake by T. Wittwer for the Amiga sticks to the same script. You play an astronaut with limited oxygen (time) chased around by various space aliens. Your only method of dealing with these multicolored threats from space is to dig a hole, lure it into a hole, and then manually fill up the hole with the alien in it. Dropping aliens on top of other aliens earns you extra points and eliminates both. Levels get progressively harder and enemies grow faster.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "T.
