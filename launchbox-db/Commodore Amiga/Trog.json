{"altername_name": ["Og", "Og!"], "name": "Trog", "overview": "Trog! (Also known as 'Og') was the second game Dave Parsons of Confused Pelican wrote for the Amiga. It was a fairly short, sideways-scrolling game in the Wonderboy style. It used pixel-perfect collision detection routines and ran in 32-colour mode. He revisited it later and made a much more colourful AGA version which had 64 colours, much smoother sky colours and screen fades, and a 1-bit parallax background layer. Outside of the game itself, it's really not very polished, and has pretty awful music.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Confused Pelican", "publishers": "5th Dimension", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtpUdeJvvs4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73685-trog\n"}
