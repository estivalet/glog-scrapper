{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sci-Fi", "overview": "Sci-Fi is 2D arcade-style side-scrolling shoot'em up in \"euroshmup\" style. The player is \"a guy with futuristic glasses\" - only 1 pilot of \"Vulcan 2\" craft at Phobos Earth Base 3. Gameplay is very typical - he flies straightforward, shoots meteorites and (later - first level has almost only meteorites) various enemies. He can spot special ship-shop - this ship sells nine power-ups, like rapid or double fire. Each power-up costs, and the player gets the money from destroying objects. The player can use a special shot - holding button gives the effect of a stream of fire.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Light Source Productions", "publishers": "Digital Magic Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/131473-sci-fi\n"}
