This game was written entirely in Blitz Basic II by Ben Campbell, and adapted and updated to version 2 by Jochen Heizmann. After the humans won against the bad aliens they were very happy - but the aliens were not beaten at all. They had found a way to repair their ships and spicy things and they had planned to destroy the human race. Of course, the humans did not agree with this and so they repaired the \"old\" spaceship and offer the man who will flight it a lot of money. You are the one who gets that important mission, but can you destroy the aliens a 2nd time?", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1997", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "", "developers": "Fullspeed Creative Development", "publishers": "Fullspeed Creative Development", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/61638-assimilation-caffeine-2\n"}
