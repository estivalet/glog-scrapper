{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bob's Garden", "overview": "After ridding the neighbourhood of aliens from the planet Graaf Pooky, Bob was looking forward to some relaxation time. Bob was enjoying himself. He was sat in a deckchair, sipping some strawberry cordial through a straw with a knotted hankerchief on his head, protecting his small bald spot. Suddenly, Bob heard a noise and saw a group of aliens from the planet Mord attacking his prized garden. They were attempting to steal all of his fruit! Back on their home planet, the aliens are running out of food, so they are attempting to borrow a cup of cherries off Bob, unfortunately they forgot to ask Bob first! This was too much for Bob, so he ran immediately to action, forgetting his flamethrower, Bazooka and even his bicycle pump. All he had was a machine for producing special balls, which he had invented yesterday. The balls are special, as they never lose momentum. You drop it from a high height, and it will bounce back to that same height, overcoming air friction in the process. The only problem was that the more the ball bounces, the colder it gets, and contact with a warm surface causes the ball to violently explode. Bob isn't worried, as he was wearing Asbestos gloves while sunbathing (His hands are very sensitive to sunlight).", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "", "developers": "Justin Leck", "publishers": "Justin Leck", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75079-bobs-garden\n"}
