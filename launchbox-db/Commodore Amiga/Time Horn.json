{"altername_name": ["Il corno del tempo"], "name": "Time Horn", "overview": "The honorable knight Mordred sets out to save his homeland from an impending invasion by the Occult Master, who rules over the neighboring lands of frost. Equipped with a sum of gold obtained from the sale of a magical artifact, Mordred must recruit fellow adventurers and complete the quests available in each city of the land. Time Horn is a turn-based RPG with an overhead view. There is no character creation as Mordred starts with fixed attributes and so do any hired NPCs, though they all progress with experience. Trading, spells, melee and long-ranged combat are all on offer. The game keeps track of hunger and thirst for each character and it is crucial to their survival for all of them to keep a steady supply of food and beverages.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Lindasoft Electronic", "publishers": "Lindasoft Electronic", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161509-time-horn\n"}
