{"altername_name": [], "name": "Shooting Star", "overview": "Shooting Star is a shoot 'em up played from a top down perspective with movement in multiple directions. The objective of each level is to collect ten yellow rings which happens automatically when moving the space ship over them. Once they have all been collected the player has to move to the exit which will transport the ship to the next level. There are plenty of hostile space ships which attempt to stop the player and these have to be avoided or killed. There are also plenty of other obstacles such as walls that the player has to avoid crashing into and often these are moving or changing form. The player has six lives and when they are all gone it is game over.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Softgang", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164310-shooting-star\n"}
