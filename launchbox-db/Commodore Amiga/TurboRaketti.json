{"altername_name": ["Turbo Raketti"], "name": "TurboRaketti", "overview": "TurboRaketti is a Finnish two-player \"caveflyer\", where you and a mate fly your Thrust-like ships around intricate levels with the ultimate aim of trying to shoot each other down. Each ship can be fitted with an extra weapon, which is triggered by pulling down on the joystick. The game has five levels to fight on: Ekolos is an ecologic level with earth tones and wild plantlife. Sitimus is an overhead map of a traffic system, a notion which doesn't quite fit in with how your ships have gravity to fight with. Metarola is a high-tech cave with pipe systems and industrial installations. Likvidius can be seen as the backyard of Metarola, since it is filled with chemicals and industrial waste. Tropulus is like the Finnish countryside, with red huts and pine trees. Your \"Turboranking\" can be saved to disk for posteriority, and so that your friends may never forget who entered the first place in 1998.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Heikki Kosola", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turboraketti", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrugohGUy4M", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162765-turboraketti\n"}
