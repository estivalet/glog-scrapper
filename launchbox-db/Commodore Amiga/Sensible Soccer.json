{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sensible Soccer", "overview": "Sensible Soccer, often called Sensi, is an association football video game series which was highly popular in the early 1990s and which still retains a cult following. It was developed by Sensible Software and first released for Amiga and Atari ST computers in 1992 as well as for the PC. The series was created by Jon Hare and Chris Yates, as a successor to their previous football game MicroProse Soccer (1988), which in turn was inspired by the arcade video game Tehkan World Cup (1985). It featured a zoomed-out bird's-eye view (the majority of games until then such as Kick Off and Match Day used a closer top-down or side view), editable national, club and custom teams and gameplay utilising a simple and user-friendly control scheme. One of the defining gameplay elements was the \"aftertouch\" feature, which enabled effective but unrealistic swerves. The game topped charts such as Amiga Power's \"All Time Top 100\". The graphic style of the game was used in other Sensible Software games, such as Mega-Lo-Mania, Cannon Fodder and Sensible Golf.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Sensible Software", "publishers": "Renegade Software", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/368174-sensible-soccer\n"}
