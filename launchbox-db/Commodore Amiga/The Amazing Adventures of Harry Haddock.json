{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Amazing Adventures of Harry Haddock", "overview": "The Amazing Adventures of Harry Haddock is a freeware platformer game for the Amiga. You use the joystick to control a smiling grey cartoon fish wearing red shorts that walks about on its tail fins. The level scrolls left-to-right across terrain such as wooden docks and small boats. There are a various items to collect for point bonuses like gemstones and food items, and enemies to avoid such as flying seagulls and snapping crabs. Some platforms move around, or disappear and reappear. There is also a time limit to complete each level. Curiously, it seems that Harry Haddock can only survive on land, and dies by falling into water. As its main in-game music, the game features a chiptune rendition of the 1993 Eurodance hit \"Saturday Night\" by Whigfield.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Towerbyte Software", "publishers": "Towerbyte Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/159188-the-amazing-adventures-of-harry-haddock\n"}
