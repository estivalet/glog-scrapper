{"altername_name": [], "name": "Boris Ball", "overview": "Boris Ball is a Breakout variant. The player controls a paddle at the bottom of the screen which can move left and right. A ball bounces between the paddle and blocks which are placed towards the top of the screen. The goal is to remove all destructible blocks by hitting them with the ball. If the ball falls out of the bottom of the screen, a life is lost. Destroying blocks may cause a power-up to fall down which has positive or negative effects when picked up, e.g. a longer paddle, shooting out balls straight from the paddle, reversed controls or a level-skip. There are overall 100 levels and it comes with a handy level editor.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ben Wyatt", "publishers": "F1 Licenceware", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DTRkTSHAXc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165103-boris-ball\n"}
