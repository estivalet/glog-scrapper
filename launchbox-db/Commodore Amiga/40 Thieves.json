{"altername_name": [], "name": "40 Thieves", "overview": "This game is called 40 thieves and is played with two packs of cards.The aim of this solitaire game is to place all 8 suits into piles, in order, at the top of the screen starting with the aces. At the start of a game you will have 40 cards dealt out, and you can deal more by clicking on the pack. A card can be picked up if it is on top of a pile. These can be moved onto cards which are of the same suit and the next highest value (e.g. 4 spades onto 5 spades) Or onto a top pile if it is of a lower value. (e.g. 4 spades onto 3 spades) Cards cannot be removed from the top piles. Only 1 card can be moved at once.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Daniel Kneeshaw", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYk6BCVTwpE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162883-40-thieves\n"}
