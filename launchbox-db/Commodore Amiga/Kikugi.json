{"altername_name": [], "name": "Kikugi", "overview": "Released by Image Tech as part of their Ancient Games Series of games. Kikugi is an ancient Japanese game of concentration and strategy. The aim is to jump one peg over another, removing from the board the peg that you jumped, ending up with one piece which should be in the center of the board. If you win the game, you are rewarded with a fortune cookie. Fifteen game boards are available; each one has a different set number of pieces, and they have different sound effects. Options allow you to back up one move or preview all available moves; meditate, allowing you to rest and review your jumps; play a solitaire or two-player game; save or load a game; and watch the computer play itself.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Image Tech", "publishers": "Image Tech", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/101313-kikugi\n"}
