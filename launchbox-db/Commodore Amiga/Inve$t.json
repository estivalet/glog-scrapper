{"altername_name": ["invest"], "name": "Inve$t", "overview": "1990 saw the release of Inve$t on the Amiga system. A Business Simulation game created by Saicon and distributed by Starbyte. One of the many, many German business simulations of those days. Nothing special about it, that would make it stick out from the TransWorld, Oil Imperium (which was great fun), Planer and whatnot crowd. Quite interesting at first, they all tend to become a tedious round-after-round marathon of excel sheets. If you enjoy business sims then this is definitely the right game for you. You\u2019re an investor with a rather large sum of money and a complete freedom of investing it in any of the offered areas. There\u2019s a lot you can do in game, but, I repeat, you\u2019ll like this game only if you like business sims.
