{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bagitman", "overview": "Bagitman is an arcade platformer. The player controls the name-giving Bagitman through several mine shaft levels composed of three screens each, his goal is to pick up money bags and put them into a wheelbarrow at the surface of the mine. Obstacles are pursuing guards, ore carts, and elevators. The only means of defence is a pickaxe, which stuns a guard temporarily. The same happens when the player manages to drop a money bag on top of a guard.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "", "developers": "Bignonia", "publishers": "Bignonia", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/74579-bagitman\n"}
