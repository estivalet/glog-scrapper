{"altername_name": [], "name": "Star Boy", "overview": "An unofficial James Pond game which was sold commercially by F1 Licenceware. It is quite good if you can look past inferior graphics, some problems with collision detections, sounds from Magic Pockets, and the lack of ingame music. There are more than 50 levels, an amount which will keep you occupied for quite a while. The difficulty is not too high, even a bit on the easy side.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Fire Fly", "publishers": "F1 Licenceware", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6LEQKPqhpQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161773-star-boy\n"}
