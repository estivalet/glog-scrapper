{"altername_name": [], "name": "Super Bumper", "overview": "A pinball game by Power Project for Amiga modeled on the classic Pinball Wizard released in the same year of 1987, all the sound fx are the same, the playing fields and high score tables have the same layout, a loading music loop is included and there's even a weird result when you try to soft re-set the Amiga just like Pinball Wizard. Has some racy backgrounds so a mature user warning may be in order.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Power Project", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B79YcOL_wPo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165128-super-bumper\n"}
