{"altername_name": [], "name": "Diplomacy", "overview": "This is another adaptation of the eponymous board game by Avalon Hill. The game is set in Europe at the start of the 20th century and up to 7 players may control the competing Great Powers (Austria, England, France, Germany, Italy, Russia and Turkey). The object of the game is to seize control of more than a half of the provinces containing production centers (which deploy new units after the year ends). Each turn (two per year) consists of two phases: diplomacy (negotiating alliances) and orders (which are given to move armies and fleets).", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Microcomputer Games", "publishers": "The Avalon Hill Game Company", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "7", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZOvGWYhs-Y", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/89975-diplomacy\n"}
