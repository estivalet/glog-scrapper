{"altername_name": ["Smash TV: The Ripoff"], "name": "Smash TV The Ripoff", "overview": "A top down shooter, a second unofficial tribute to the grooviest of arcade genocidal blasters, Smash TV: the Rip-Off is the better of the tributes made, better than Smash Telly that is and in some ways an improvement on the original. It's faster, slicker, easier to control and much much closer to the spirit of the original game. Gloriously psychopathic action from start to finish. Unfortunately way too short.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mark Gallagher", "publishers": "", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThGkKxOQKsI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162033-smash-tv-the-ripoff\n"}
