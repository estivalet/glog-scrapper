{"altername_name": [], "name": "Blade", "overview": "The author, veteran Amiga programmer Mark Sheeky, designs and creates every part of this games on his own. So, the evil demon Qaal, who has been trapped for years inside the hilt of the magic sword Blade and kept inside an impenetrable cage underground, has been freed by the eruption of the volcano Maetux. Another role playing game, then. Blade looks a lot like UFO: Enemy Unknown, only the characters are all even more wooden and the scrolling even more jerky. However, it plays more like graphics-free public domain classics Rogue and Angband. You have four unimaginative fantasy heroes chosen from seven possibilities, which you move around turn by turn and hit monsters and things. There are shops to visit, statues, altars and things like that which have magical effects if you click on them and there are spells and weapons to collect and use. If you have the patience of a saint, I'm sure there's a lot of gameplay in there somewhere. There are dozens of levels, spells, weapons and monsters to find and nobody could complain of a lack of challenge, and there are two difficulty levels if you do find it too easy. Lots to see, I just don't think you'll want to persevere.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Scorpius Software", "publishers": "Alive Mediasoft", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75045-blade\n"}
