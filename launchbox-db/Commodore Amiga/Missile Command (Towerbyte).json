{"altername_name": [], "name": "Missile Command (Towerbyte)", "overview": "An unofficial amiga port created by Kevin Gallagher. The player's six cities are being attacked by an endless hail of ballistic missiles, some of which split like multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles. New weapons are introduced in later levels: smart bombs that can evade a less-than-perfectly targeted missile, and bomber planes and satellites that fly across the screen launching missiles of their own. As a regional commander of three anti-missile batteries, the player must defend six cities in their zone from being destroyed.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2020", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kevin Gallagher", "publishers": "", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smmdc8_h2T4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161951-missile-command-towerbyte\n"}
