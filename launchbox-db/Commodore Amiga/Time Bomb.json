{"altername_name": [], "name": "Time Bomb", "overview": "A Gridtrap inspired game where you de-fuse time bombs before time runs out and they explode. You score points by reaching the bombs and disarming them, collecting bonus flags and clearing the bombs. You must avoid Skull & Crossbones, collapsing floors and a mean time limit that gets meaner as time goes by. Each level of the game consists of 10 grids which must be cleared of bombs before the time limit is up. Disarm bombs by moving the player on to the same square as the bomb. You collect flags in the same manner. Once you step on a piece of floor it will collapse and you cannot go back the way you came. So you need to plan your route carefully.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "C.
