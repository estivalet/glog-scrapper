{"altername_name": [], "name": "Blastaball", "overview": "A good, if challenging, conversion of the Arcadia game. The graphics are of a high standard - everything is suitably metallic and hi-tech but the front-end presentation is weak with no theme tune or loading screen. Craft control takes a little getting used to due to the high level of Inertia - it's much more apparent on this version than on the others - but practice makes perfect. Blastaball should keep most Amiga owners happy for a while, though interest could soon be lost due to its simplistic concept; the game doesn't change much, it just gets harder.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Binary Design", "publishers": "Mastertronic", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75047-blastaball\n"}
