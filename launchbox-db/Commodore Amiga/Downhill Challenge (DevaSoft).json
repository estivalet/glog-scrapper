{"altername_name": [], "name": "Downhill Challenge (DevaSoft)", "overview": "This is \"Downhill Challenge\" for the Commodore Amiga released back in 1990 by Deva Soft as Public Domain/Freeware and developed by David Alves. It's a simple and fun to play skiing game. You can find it in Assassins' disk number 6. Skylar Mountain. Dangerous, steep and downright scary. You were made for this mountain. Ski like the wind, picking up bonus flags as you go. Jump over rocks, branches and bushes for extra points. Avoid hitting obstacles, you can only fall 5 times before being disqualified. The longer you stay up, the faster you ski and the more points you get as you travel.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Devasoft", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb_EJw6nOqo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162279-downhill-challenge-devasoft\n"}
