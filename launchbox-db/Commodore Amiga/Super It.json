{"altername_name": [], "name": "Super It", "overview": "Basically, Super It is a computerized version of It, or Tig, as we used to call it in these parts. Four players can compete, and the person who is It can Tig any of the others at any time, whereupon they become It. The game is played against the clock, and the person who is It when the time runs out is the loser. The three Amigos obviously never played by Cheshire rules. Whereas when I was at school it was a well known law that \"You can't Tiggy butcher\" - a person who was It couldn't Tig back the person who Tigged them - it's perfectly acceptable to do so in Super It. Still, it seems that the rest of the world plays a different set of pub pool. Game came with an included Super iT map editor.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1998", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Andy Wheeler", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m01A-PILlts", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162631-super-it\n"}
