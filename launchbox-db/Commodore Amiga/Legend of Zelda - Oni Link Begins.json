{"altername_name": [], "name": "Legend of Zelda: Oni Link Begins", "overview": "This, the second game in the series is more difficult that Legend of Zelda: Return of the Hylian, and gives us the ability to transform into Oni Link when close to death, and this provides a fire sword and a fighting chance to come back. The enemies are easy, but temples are made harder by having to walk around in circles, and trigger buttons far away to make any progress. There is a hidden switch also, and having to fight two bats with just one skull.
