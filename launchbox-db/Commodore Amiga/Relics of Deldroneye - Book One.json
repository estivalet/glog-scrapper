He must find a way to escape the prison, and get to the planet Zantis. The interface splits the screen vertically: the top half of the screen shows the current scene, and underneath is a panel that shows the items that Falcon is carrying, as well as ten action buttons (\"Move\", \"Look\", \"Take\", \"Use\", \"Talk\", \"Open\", \"Close\", \"Give\", \"Offer\" and \"Show\"). The action panel also has secondary tabs that give contextual information about important characters, and displays the length of time that you have been playing.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Digital Ninja", "publishers": "F1 Licenceware", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThPx-UhMON8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161571-relics-of-deldroneye-book-one\n"}
