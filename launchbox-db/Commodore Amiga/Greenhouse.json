{"altername_name": [], "name": "Greenhouse", "overview": "One of the very first REAL Nintendo conversions for the Amiga 1200, this recreation of the classic game and watch handheld game. The player controls a bug exterminator only referred to as the \"Fumigator\" in the manual, and the objective is to spray worms and spiders that try to eat the flowers in a greenhouse. The worms crawl along vines on the top screen, while the spiders crawl along webs on the bottom screen, and the player will have to try to hit them with a spray before they reach the flowers (which would then die, giving the player a miss). The spiders are a little more difficult to defeat, as they are killed only when sprayed closest to a flower (they simply back away when sprayed farther away). The game is a two-level one with a ladder connecting the two parts (which otherwise offer almost identical action).", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mufftendo", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-5awr5Uqso", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/163868-greenhouse\n"}
