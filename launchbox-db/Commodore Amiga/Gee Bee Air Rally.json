{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gee Bee Air Rally", "overview": "Gee Bee Air Rally adds another dimension to motor racing - literally, as the action takes place in the sky. It targets the feel of pioneering races between 250mph planes in the valleys of the southern USA between brave but honest goggle-wearing men - a sort of Mille Miglia in the sky. The game consists of 16 courses, which are marked out by giant suspended cones, each of which is to be completed against a time limit, while avoiding contact with the other planes. You must stay within the cones, any time spent outside it results in the alloted time ticking down at a prohibitively fast rate (so don't think of short-cutting the track). After every second successful race, you take on a bonus track, in which balloons must be hit for points.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "March 1, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Activision", "publishers": "Activision", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.88", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gee_Bee_Air_Rally", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40374-gee-bee-air-rally\n"}
