{"altername_name": [], "name": "Jackman", "overview": "A very interesting Pac-man game with small graphics and some tricky levels created by Marcus Johansson, Goran Nilsson and Anders Nilsson. It requires keys to get into some sections of the dungeon and there is a time limit to get all the dots. This is the full version. The panel says \"demo version\". But it's not. From the doc file: \"This is the full version of JackMan even if the scoreline says it's a demo version...\" Level 12 can be particularly tough to get past, enjoy the fun!", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "NC Gamez", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vugb-Af33Uw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162353-jackman\n"}
