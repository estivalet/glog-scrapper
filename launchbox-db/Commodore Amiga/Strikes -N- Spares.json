{"altername_name": [], "name": "Strikes -N- Spares", "overview": "Ten Pin Bowling hasn\u2019t been recreated on computer very much, and this is an ambitious attempt, which appears to have been written by someone with an unhealthy love of the game. The options you\u2019d expect are present, such as multi-player games and saveable statistics, with all the subtleties of the scoring system implemented correctly. The alley is represented in 3D, with the pins flying depending on the impact speed, and several other (empty) lanes in view. There are two control systems on offer, one of which gives the game an action feel, and the other redefines bowling into a fairly exact science. In the former, you press fire to pick up the ball, position it by sliding the mouse left or right, then throw it by launching the mouse forward \u2013 the ball\u2019s direction and pace is dependant on the straightness and speed of the delivery. The second mode involves using a set of options to define the ball\u2019s speed, swerve and starting position, then clicking on \u2018Bowl\u2019 to set an arrow into motion, which you use to select the direction.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Beyond Entertainment", "publishers": "Beyond Entertainment", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "8", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/131506-strikes--n--spares\n"}
