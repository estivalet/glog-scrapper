{"altername_name": [], "name": "Boxx 3", "overview": "Enjoyable, albeit a bit on the easy side. Boxx 3 is a standard platformer: You walk from level to right, jump over platforms and on the occasional baddie, pull levers to open doors, and collect coins. The gameplay changes during the boss battles at the end of each level. You get a gun and enter an arena fight against a large sprite with a lot of hit points. These bosses have simple attack patterns and are not very challenging. If you defeat one, it drops a key that opens the level exit door. I like that the graphics that were drawn by the author and not ripped from other games. The music, which was not made for this game, is very good.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "January 16, 2017", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "", "developers": "Lemming880", "publishers": "Aminet", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75190-boxx-3\n"}
