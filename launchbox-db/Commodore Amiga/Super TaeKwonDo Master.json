{"altername_name": [], "name": "Super TaeKwonDo Master", "overview": "Super TaeKwonDo Master is a 2D action martial arts simulator for 1 or 2 players (3 to 6 players in tournament mode). Like Mortal Kombat the game uses fully digitized characters, superimposed into a computer generated world in splendid graphical glory. Settings include a combat hall, backstreets and a fuel dump. Sequences of joystick moves are used to trigger special moves. Unlike Mortal Kombat and the like, the moves are purely realistic. There's no hurling fireballs at your enemy here, you must be a quality fighter to take on these guys. Strategy and skill are of the utmost importance. Unlike the non-'Super' version, this edition runs on non-AGA systems as well as AGA. Despite being released as an OCS/ECS version only, SUPER TAEKWONDO MASTER is an enhanced update of TAEKWONDO MASTER (AGA) featuring more attractive graphics (albeit using fewer colours), hand-drawn scrolling background graphics with more expansive fighting arenas and more skilled opponents.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Beer Boyz Software", "publishers": "Mirage", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "6", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xpFvttP_Eg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161813-super-taekwondo-master\n"}
