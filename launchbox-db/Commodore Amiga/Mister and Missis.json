Mister can do some things that Missis cannot and visa versa, get the teddy bear to swap places. Work together to geefle for your gonk, when necessary. Turn on all the light bulbs, avoid fire and other dangers. This is a somewhat punishingly difficult platform experience, but because of that it can be extremely satisfying to overcome. The full game was released as shareware.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "June 1, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "j.R.Evans", "publishers": "Amiga Power", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBGzEVktWRI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164277-mister-and-missis\n"}
