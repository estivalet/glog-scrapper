{"altername_name": [], "name": "Alternate Reality: The City", "overview": "In this old first-person RPG, you are one of many people who have been abducted from earth by aliens and transported to an alternate dimension where you are dumped in a strange, yet familiar city. Your quest is to explore the city, and find the clues that will lead you to your captors and help you get back home. In addition to standard first-person RPG's of that era, like skills, stats, experience points and a repertoire of shops and places to visit, the game offered moral evaluation of your character, and depending on your actions you would be good or evil, and that affected how the environment reacted to you. Encounters were not necessarily just resolved with combat, but you could also try to trick, charm or bribe opponents, and the storyline is very non-linear, for example allowing you to take a job in order to enhance a particular skill or just to pass away time. Alternate Reality: The City is the first part of an unfinished series of five planned RPG's.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Datasoft", "publishers": "Datasoft", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/74204-alternate-reality-the-city\n"}
