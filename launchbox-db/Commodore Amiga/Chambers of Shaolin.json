{"altername_name": [], "name": "Chambers of Shaolin", "overview": "In the first part of this game, you will have to train your character in the various chambers of Shaolin. Each exercise, which includes balancing on trees, kicking a pendulum and dodging objects coming towards you, will improve your skills like stamina and strength. The better you do in the chambers, the easier it will be for you in part two. Part two is a more traditional 2D fighting game where you have to advance from level to level by beating your opponents up.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Thalion Software", "publishers": "Grandslam Entertainments", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chambers_of_Shaolin", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/9794-chambers-of-shaolin\n"}
