{"altername_name": [], "name": "Jungle Jim", "overview": "It is hard to believe that in 1991, a software house would have the confidence to offer another Pac-Man variant and also demand money. The British low-priced label Energise, however, has done exactly the same. Instead of the pills-eating Smiley, Jimmy runs through 50 labyrinths to pick up pieces of gold. Whoever thinks this is unimaginative should first see the opponents: the ghosts of the original have mutated into snakes, birds, spiders and cannibals. Of course, the power pills are still there, but they just look like bananas. However, vitamin B alone is not enough; now you can also collect weapons to get your opponents on the collar. The graphics do not have any variety, boring imagery and sprites. In the background can be heard some monotonous jungle music. Oh, a very exciting feature I almost forgot: there is even a (comfortable) editor, with which you can assemble even more superfluous levels for this superfluous game.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "EDOS", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ws__Cx2yEU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72148-jungle-jim\n"}
