Smarty likes to spend his free time in Grandpa\u2019s laboratory experimenting with all sorts of ideas and gadgets. Smarty has a dog called Slurpy who is his best buddy \u2013 besides Grandpa. Smarty also plays the saxophone but he often finds daily practice less interesting than something else. One day Grandpa makes a huge breakthrough in his lab. The dream machine he\u2019s been obsessed with for years finally works! With the machine, Grandpa has the ability to enter other people\u2019s dreams. He\u2019s planning to use this power for helping all those suffering from sleep disorders. But then unexpected bad things start to happen. Dr. Nightmare \u2013 Grandpa\u2019s archenemy and a less capable but highly vicious inventor \u2013 breaks into the lab and steals the dream machine while taking Grandpa into captivity. Then Nightmare uses the machine to take both himself and Grandpa into the dream world where he\u2019s aiming to use the machine to control people\u2019s dreams and ultimately gain control of people\u2019s lives.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "July 31, 2020", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Eero Tunkelo", "publishers": "Bitmap Soft", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RlbYVMd7OE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/150876-smarty-and-the-nasty-gluttons\n"}
