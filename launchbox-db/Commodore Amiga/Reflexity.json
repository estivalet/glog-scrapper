{"altername_name": [], "name": "Reflexity", "overview": "Reflexity Pinball Challenge is a German pinball game. It has support to four players and features three tables with an Alien-inspired theme. There's a multiball feature: an U-shaped magnet on the tables holds up to three balls and releases them when a fourth touches the third. Each player starts with four balls. The player switches tables by hitting the teleporter with the ball. The teleporter area opens when a certain amount of points is reached (150,000 points for the second table, and 600,000 points for the third). A bonus table with a timer appears after teleporting.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Hitech Studio Designs", "publishers": "CompuTec Verlag", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "https://www.mobygames.com/game/amiga/reflexity-pinball-challenge", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/108383-reflexity\n"}
