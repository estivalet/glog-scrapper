{"altername_name": [], "name": "Eat the Whistle", "overview": "Eat the Whistle is a soccer game originally released to tie in with the 1998 World Cup, held in and won by France. The full tournament is included, but custom leagues can also be created. The game's perspective is from the top with a slight angle, but scrolling sideways rather than top-bottom. The game includes variable weather and light conditions, variable referee strictness, and different match lengths. As well as realistic soccer, there is a mode compared by the packaging to Speedball 2, with no fouls and randomly appearing power-ups.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hurricane Studios", "publishers": "Epic Marketing", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/92776-eat-the-whistle\n"}
