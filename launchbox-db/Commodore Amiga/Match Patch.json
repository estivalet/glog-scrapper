{"altername_name": [], "name": "Match Patch", "overview": "Match Patch was released on CU Amiga (Dec 1991), Amiga Action 62 (Oct 1994), The One Amiga 47 (Aug 1992). A fun but hard platform game. You drop down the holes to change your weapon, but the enemies will also change when they drop down the holes. Your goal is to clear the screen of enemies before time runs out. There are five enemy types, and each can only be killed by bullets of its own type. (Fire beats fire, ice beats ice\u2026 this is opposite to modern game design thinking, perhaps because this was 1990 and Pok\u00e9mon wasn\u2019t invented yet.)", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JmTsBi_eTo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161648-match-patch\n"}
