{"altername_name": [], "name": "Harold (The Hairy Hermit)", "overview": "Harold the Hairy Hermit is a platformer which involves the rescue of stray dalmatian puppies. Spanning five levels, each separated into three stages and a boss, the aim is to rescue the requisite number of puppies. A demo originally appeared at the ECTS (European Computer Trade Show) and this one-disk version has been previously available. However, the game was not released and a mostly complete three disk version existed. This was in the possession of Nigel Critten, a programmer who had helped Rasputin with the A1200 and CD32 versions of Jetstrike and who was asked to look at Harold. It is thanks to Nigel that the disks survived. This three disk version is still not 100% complete and has some issues; some levels crash and there is some level tile corruption.
