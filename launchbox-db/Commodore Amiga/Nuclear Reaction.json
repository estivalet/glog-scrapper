{"altername_name": [], "name": "Nuclear Reaction", "overview": "The goal is control the entirety of the 20 squares on the 5x4 board. This is done by creating a chain reaction that when finished gives leaves you with all squares marked. You can achieve this when two or more checks or atoms are in a single square. When this happens as a result of a reaction it will split off all but one of the marks in a direction. If this addition hits another color it will change them to your color. If there are then more than one mark in that bot it will in turn fragment, possibly starting more reactions.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bob Akerberg", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8zWIDwRDvc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164364-nuclear-reaction\n"}
