{"altername_name": [], "name": "Plotting", "overview": "Originating in the arcades, Plotting involves several different types of blocks, bearing symbols such as squares, circles and crosses. Using a small yellow object to direct a block across onto a particular section of a shaped wall. It will then rebound onto a set of blocks at a particular angle, with the intention of removing similar blocks it touches. This is done against a time limit, and there are special blocks to help out with extra lives.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ocean France", "publishers": "Ocean Software", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.75", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plotting_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/43085-plotting\n"}
