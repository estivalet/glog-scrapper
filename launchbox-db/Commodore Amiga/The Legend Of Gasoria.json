{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Legend Of Gasoria", "overview": "An extensive Czech language text game by the Penline group, which took more than two years to develop. The game should run on every OCS Amiga, however with min. 1.5MB RAM. Unlike many other text adventures, here the player does not move around the game world only in the obligatory four directions north-south-west-east, but must choose, for example, to walk along a footpath, enter the forest, etc. which means, among other things, that even drawing the map is somewhat more difficult.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Penline Software", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/373609-the-legend-of-gasoria\n"}
