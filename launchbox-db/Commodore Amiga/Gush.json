{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gush", "overview": "A puzzle game game in the style of Pipe Dream, created by Gareth Watt and released in 1993. It is your first day as a plumber. Unfortunately, you have have been assigned to do a job at a haunted house. The problem is that a mysterious liquid called ecto-slime keeps flowing through certain sections of pipeline which you have laid and you are getting pretty irate. Lay a specific length of pipe. The distance of pipe required is displayed at the bottom right of the play area beside your score. You have a limited amount of time at the beginning before the ecto-slime normally starts to ooze down the pipeline. It will keep flowing until the end of the pipe is reached. Keep laying the correct configuration of pipes in order for the slime not to reach the end of the pipe until you have reached your assigned end piece. Any sections already on the playing field must be used.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Xi Software", "publishers": "", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bALuK7AEufQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162355-gush\n"}
