{"altername_name": [], "name": "Calculation", "overview": "Calculation is more than just another solitaire game; it's solitaire like you always wished it could be. The object is to stack the cards into 4 ordered stacks, one that counts by one, one by 2, one by 3 and one by 4. Cards are dealt one at a time. A dealt card can either go on one of the stacks, if it fits or on the top of one of the four discard piles. The top card of the discard piles may be moved to the stacks.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Rovena Kessinger", "publishers": "UnSane Creations", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/131203-calculation\n"}
