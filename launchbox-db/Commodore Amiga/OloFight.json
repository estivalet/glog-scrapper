{"altername_name": [], "name": "OloFight", "overview": "Hundreds of thousands of years into the future, the descendants of mankind live on artificial planets in a solar system far away from the long ago destroyed planet Earth. One day, an evil being finds out the secret of the energy produced within the deserted planet of Kobaia, and he does not intend to use that power for the good of his fellow man. Warriors from all the planets in the system set out to stop him. However, being descendents of the warlike mankind, they will not hesitate to fight each other as well... With this premise, Olofight is a futuristic beat'em'up. Eight characters are available to choose from, each with their own special powers. Apart from the usual kicks, jumps and punches, which are accessible through a simple system tailored for one-button joysticks, four special attacks are available by loading a power meter. These attacks are expendible, though, so once the allotted number of attacks have been used up, the fighters will have to rely on their conventional powers. When an opponent is defeated, you can learn special moves from them, and customise your moves before matches.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "The Real Ologram", "publishers": "The Real Ologram", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/131366-olofight\n"}
