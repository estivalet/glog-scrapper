{"altername_name": [], "name": "Stalker", "overview": "Additional information from the coder J\u00f3zsef Punk: \"Stalker is a prototype of an Amiga game I developed with two of my friends about 20 years ago. The main unique feature of the game was the rearrangeable playfield. The player controls a two leg robot in a scene that is built by same sized blocks. These blocks are moveable in rearrange mode. He went on to say, although there are different versions available, the game was never finished nor released as they couldn't find a publisher to finance the development.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mercury Projects", "publishers": "", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKWiWnJ-_4o", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165493-stalker\n"}
