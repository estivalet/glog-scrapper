{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pipe Rider", "overview": "Fairly standard space shooter with the slight twist of having you control two ships that ride along a pipe at the edges of the screen in some levels. The game features a title theme with typical soundtracker library samples and what sounds like an unlicenced sample from some synth pop band between levels. I am a bit surprised this is supposed to be a commercial game because it merely meets the technical proficiency of readily available shareware and freeware titles of the mid-nineties.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Funtastic Creations", "publishers": "Magic Soft", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.62", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72677-pipe-rider\n"}
