{"altername_name": [], "name": "Amiganoid", "overview": "Amiganoid is a breakout clone game, developed by Digital Illusions and published by Amiga Format for free as a Public Domain and was released in 1993. As the name might indicate, Amiganoid is a Arkanoid variant made for the Amiga. It follows the gameplay of the original game closely, but it has an extra paddle on the right side of the screen. The bottom and right sides of the screen are both gaps to avoid losing the ball into. You have to destroy all bricks on the screen by bouncing a ball off the paddles. Some bricks requires two hits to break, while some others can't be destroyed at all. The longer you have the ball in the air, the quicker the and harder the game will be. When breaking all the bricks on a level you will go on to the next level. In total there is 25 different levels.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Digital Illusions CE", "publishers": "Amiga Format", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O03pxj0FzAg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/65704-amiganoid\n"}
