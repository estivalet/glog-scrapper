{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mission: Con-Bat", "overview": "Mission: Con-Bat is a vehicle simulation game, developed and published by Questrek, which was released in 1988. Even though the treaty was signed, there's no guarantee that missiles will not continue to be built and installed. For this reason, night reconnaissance missions will be lfown, in order to photograph possible illegal missile installations on designated island targets. Neither side wants to be found in non-compliance, therefore, these missions could prove to be very hazardous. Due to the high risk involved, all flights will be manned by volunteers. You'll have no offensive weaponry on board your aircraft. Instead, you'll be equipped with the finest state-of-the-art decoys, designed to draw enemy fire away from you. Radar jamming capabilities will offer some protection while precision mouse control provides excellent response time and maneuverability. A carrier will be standing by to receive you on completion of your missions. A refueler will also be scheduled to rendezvous with you at designated times. Your mission is to photograph enemy islands and land safely back on the carrier.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Questrek", "publishers": "Questrek", "genres": "Vehicle Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0sJkO0rAn4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164275-mission-con-bat\n"}
