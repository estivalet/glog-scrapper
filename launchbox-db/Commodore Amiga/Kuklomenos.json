{"altername_name": ["Kuklomenos 0.2.3.2"], "name": "Kuklomenos", "overview": "Peace reigns. We guard the Nodes. Years pass. Evil comes! Evil seeks the power of the Nodes! We must defend the Nodes. Evil must not extract their power! If it is the only way, we must destroy the Nodes ourselves! It is the only way. The encroaching Blobs of Evil will kill you if they hit you. Evil wants to control the triangular Nodes. It will send big blue armoured Blobs of Evil to infest them. You can control the Nodes yourself - press '4' to send a Capture Pod out. Whoever is in control of a Node gets bonuses. Evil extracts from Nodes it controls, filling the cyan bar in the top right. If it fills the bar, it will launch a deadly Wave of Mutilation! Disinfect an infested Node by shooting the Blob of Evil before it manages to put up a shield, or by sending a Capture Pod. If you keep control of a Node for a while, it will start to pulsate. It is then primed for destruction, and a red shot will destroy it. YOUR AIM: to destroy 4 of the 6 Nodes. Evil will then give up and leave.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2008", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Andreas Schiffler", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/167093-kuklomenos\n"}
