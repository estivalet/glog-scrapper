{"altername_name": [], "name": "No Buddies Land", "overview": "No Buddies Land was originally coded on the Atari ST by Dave Boshoven, graphics by Sense and music by Lotus (ST demo crew Hotline). Later on ported to the Amiga, but unfortunately never got published as the publisher went bankrupt. The game has average graphics and relatively good music, but the controls are horrible. The basic idea is well known - you must climb up the level to escape the raising water level. I remember the fuss with magazines banging on about demo coders should be making games, and this game shows why that wasn't necessarily the case.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Eternal", "publishers": "Expose", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFr8OMD48GQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72564-no-buddies-land\n"}
