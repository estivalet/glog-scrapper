{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gem'X", "overview": "The basic idea is that you are presented with 2 sets of tiles, and must make the left one identical to the 'control' set on the right. The colours are defined in a sequence - red, green, blue, purple, yellow - and when you click on a tile, that tile's colour moves forward by two in that sequence (for example a blue one becomes yellow), whereas the tiles next to it move by one colour (for example, blue becomes purple).", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Kaiko", "publishers": "Demonware Softwarehaus GmbH", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.17", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gem'X", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/I8Glx1e0nm8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/71933-gemx\n"}
