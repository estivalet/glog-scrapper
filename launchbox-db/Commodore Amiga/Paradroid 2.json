{"altername_name": ["Paradroid II"], "name": "Paradroid 2", "overview": "Like it's predecessor, the unofficial sequel to Paradroid is a top view shoot-em-up set aboard large space freighters filled with droids. After going through a storm in space, the rays affected the droids and they malfunctioned and killed the crew. You now have to destroy all the droids on the fleet of ships. You control an \"Influence Device\" which can temporarily control other droids and use their weapons to destroy the others. When your power is low or your damage is high, you will need to transfer to another droid or risk losing your Influence Device.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Marc S.
