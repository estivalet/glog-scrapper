{"altername_name": ["Summer Camp: Featuring Maximus Mouse"], "name": "Summer Camp", "overview": "In Summer Camp, you play Maximus Mouse. The flag of Wottadump has gone missing, 24 hours before the start of the season. Maximus must find a replacement, and decides to get the one on the moon. The game is a platform game, made up of four levels, each made up of a collection of inter-connected screens. There are a variety of objects to collect, but the aim on each level is to collect the parts (found in ACME crates) of a vehicle to get to the next one. When all the parts are in place, there is a sub-game where the vehicle is constructed, although this is only for bonus points.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Lodestone", "publishers": "Black Legend", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109871-summer-camp\n"}
