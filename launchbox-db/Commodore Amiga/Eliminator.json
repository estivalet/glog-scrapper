{"altername_name": [], "name": "Eliminator", "overview": "A shoot \u2018em up set on a patchwork-quilt colored road, Eliminator puts you in control of a ship with a basic weapon, flying along at breakneck speed. There are barriers along the way to avoid, often set in quick succession, and lots of bad guys to shoot at or avoid - their shots must be avoided too. Some parts of the track are blocked unless you can shoot through obstacles before reaching them, or hit a jump pad. At some points you can change to travelling along the ceiling as well. Tokens can be collected en route, and used to obtain better weapons, but losing a life costs you the best one you\u2019ve currently got.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Linel", "publishers": "Hewson Consultants", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKRf4oiW1b0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/41095-eliminator\n"}
