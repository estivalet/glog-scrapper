{"altername_name": ["Project Buzzbar"], "name": "Project Buzz Bar", "overview": "Project Buzz Bar combines gameplay elements from Asteroids and Defender. On each level there are several men to rescue by flying over them. They float loose in space amongst different types of enemy ships, many of which fire at you. Your ship is constantly moving due to a strong gravitational pull from the planet's surface, making it harder to direct the ship at first. The game is written in Blitz BASIC 2, and not only is the source code provided, it scrolls through it on the title screen. The game was released as a coverdisk on The One magazine.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Simon Armstrong", "publishers": "The One (Coverdisk)", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbtcbvFxVHw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164487-project-buzz-bar\n"}
