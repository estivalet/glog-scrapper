{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cytron", "overview": "Viewed from above, Cytron is inspired by Paradroid and Alien Breed. The robot Cytron has been sent into a research facility in which robots have gone berserk, and it must safeguard the area and rescue the trapped scientists. The character control is skittish, meaning that the droid is hard to stop instantly, which makes progression through the levels harder. One unusual feature is that the droid can be split into two components, Cyt and Ron, in a manner similar to Head Over Heels. This comes in useful when switches must be activated in a part of the level away from the force-field they unlock, as Cyt can be sent to flick the switch so that Ron can progress through the level as soon as it is flicked.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Lunatic Software", "publishers": "Psygnosis", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytron", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/74001-cytron\n"}
