German U-boats, U.S. destroyers or Allied merchant ships are there, waiting for the right commands. They operate in small groups, just as the real things did in WW2. Full status screens tell you what state your boat is in at any time. It's possible to play one of the twelve built-in scenarios or an self-created scenario. The game has no career mode.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Novalogic", "publishers": "Br\u00f8derbund Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.83", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfpack_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/104342-wolf-pack\n"}
