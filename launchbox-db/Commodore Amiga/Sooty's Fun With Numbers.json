{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sooty's Fun With Numbers", "overview": "Six short mathematical tests aimed at children up to 7 years of age come together in this package. Sooty the silent magical bear is one of the UK\u2019s most enduring children\u2019s characters, and his friends Sweep the squeaking dog and Soo the talking bear join him here. The games can be played with little or no computer knowledge, and feature full graphics. In Magic Numbers the player must count how many wands Sooty has on the screen. Sweep\u2019s Bones involves moving bones from a pile on the right (Sweep\u2019s stash) to the left (the ones he will enjoy today). Soo\u2019s Hats is an addition test. In Bigger/Smaller you are presented with 2 numbers, and asked to select the biggest or smallest, which Sooty will magic away with his wand. Order Order presents a line of numbers, some of which are filled in, and challenges the player to select the others (which are randomly arranged elsewhere on the screen) and place them in the correct positions. Soo\u2019s Race brings these skills together \u2013 you are asked a succession of questions, and answering them correctly will see Sooty\u2019s car move along a track, and hopefully win its race against Sweep.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Enigma Variations", "publishers": "Alternative Software", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "http://hol.abime.net/5954", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU0PmscxGus", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165509-sootys-fun-with-numbers\n"}
