{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tsch", "overview": "A single player action/navigation game. Fly through the blocks in such a way that you can get the best speed and maneuverablity. Grab the jewels, avoid the reverse unless you really need to back for a goody or to reverse from a previous reverse or bouncy. Grab the extra lives, you'll need them. Watch the solid killer blocks and the gravity blocks will pull you down. Faster increases score, but is risky. Focus on the jewels, as getting them gets you to the next level.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Games for May", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjrGJRCnDm8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162248-tsch\n"}
