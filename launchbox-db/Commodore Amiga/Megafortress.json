The game takes place in the late 1980s and early 1990s and features three distinct sets of missions: Red Flag (USAF) training exercises at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada, a fictional series of missions during the First Gulf War, and a special mission which reenacts the plot of the novel Flight of the Old Dog. The player is in command of a crew flying a super modified and experimental B-52 bomber, outfitted with the latest weapons and stealth technology. (In the novel, it was more advanced than the B-1 Excalibur, the Strategic Air Command's most advanced bomber). The game campaign mostly takes place in Iraq, but there is 1 mission that takes the bomber to the old Soviet Union like in the novel.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Artech Digital Entertainment", "publishers": "Three-Sixty Pacific", "genres": "Flight Simulator", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megafortress", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/127890-megafortress\n"}
