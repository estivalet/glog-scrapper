{"altername_name": [], "name": "RCross", "overview": "An open source conversion by BSzili and created by Franticware for the #hvdosdev2021 competition at https://www.high-voltage.cz where it won the first place, this is a 3D rally racing simulator. You control a small RC car on various terrains and race against time. Frca kindly agreed to share the source code, so it became a nice weekend project to get it running on the Amiga. The original game DOS needs an 486 DX with 8 MB RAM, and the Amiga version has similar requirements. To play it you'll need a 68040 or 68060 with an FPU, 8 MB Fast RAM, AGA chipset or RTG. When you pass between checkpoints marked with green blocks, the display shows if you are behind or ahead of the track record. I like how the car's suspension visibly reacts to bumps in the track. The game saves your lap times, and gives trophies for beating the top times Normal and Reverse; which is really addictive. The RC car feels light, and can roll over on the 6 different landscapes in the game; where you can press ESC if you want to abort a run.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2022", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "FranticWare", "publishers": "Aminet", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/h7QND3bup5k", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/368439-rcross\n"}
