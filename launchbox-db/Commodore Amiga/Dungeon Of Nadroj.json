{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dungeon Of Nadroj", "overview": "Dungeon of Nadroj is a shareware dungeon-crawler inspired by games such as Hack, Larn, Moira, Shadowgate, Blackmar's Dungeon etc (according to the intro text). Using the numeric keypad, you control your adventurer in a six-level dungeon, with the goal of surviving and reaching the bottom floor where you must kill an evil wizard. Four players may play, choosing from four character classes: human, dwarf, elf and hobbit. The screen is made up of three \"windows\": an overhead map in traditional Hack fashion, a view of whatever monster, treasure or shop you encounter, and a bottom text window where messages scroll by. Monster encounters offer the choice of attacking, defending, running, thrusting or using items. If you flee, you may be forced to drop something in your inventory. If you encounter a human, dwarf or hobbit you may fight or talk, which may lead to valuable hints. The full version has a random dungeon generator.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "William Jordan", "publishers": "17 Bit Software", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/371953-dungeon-of-nadroj\n"}
