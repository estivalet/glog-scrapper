A color code is hidden at the top. You have 10 tries to figure it out by trying different color combinations. Black and white pins tell you if how many correct colors you have - white means that a pin is in the right place, black that the selection does include that color pin, but in a different place. By using logic you can crack the code!", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "March 26, 1997", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Reverse Logic Software", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164789-master-mind-saeden\n"}
