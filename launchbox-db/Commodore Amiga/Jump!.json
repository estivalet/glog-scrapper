Yoomp! 64 was originally released in 2020 by RGCD and Psytronik Software on the C64, as port of the fantastic Atari XE/XL game. It featured gaming mechanics in which you need to bounce a ball through many different three-dimensional textured tubes, to collect as many points as you can while trying not to fall off the edge. The creator Kefir_Union has said there are a number of differences compared to the Atari version of Yoomp. As in Jump! there are 16 tiles on an axis game field, there are 10 deep tiles that are visible instead of 4 for better planning of moment, newly added special orange bonus fields, which change game for collecting points, there are more special fields which may cause other fields to disappear, the game will have 28 levels of challenging ball bouncing fun, 5 music tracks by XTD/Lamers, and playable in a resolution 320x256 in 256 colours!", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "November 21, 2021", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "", "developers": "MASZYNERIA", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1JP5TSIL50", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/373011-jump\n"}
