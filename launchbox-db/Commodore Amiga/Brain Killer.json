According to German interviews with Michael Garlich of Titan, the game was cancelled because the \"final version\" submitted by the programmers was considered too buggy for commercial release [Sources: Amiga Future, Apr/May 99 issue; NoCover #53, June 98 issue.] and because of military, school and other commitments by the primary coders. Still this first person shooter in the shadow of Doom\\Wolfenstein games was intriguing enough to have a lot of people willing to play the unfinished product.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1997", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Virtual Madness", "publishers": "Titan", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Y5MEQUc38", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162419-brain-killer\n"}
