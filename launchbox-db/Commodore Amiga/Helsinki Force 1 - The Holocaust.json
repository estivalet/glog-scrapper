{"altername_name": ["Helsinki Force"], "name": "Helsinki Force 1: The Holocaust", "overview": "Based on the movie of the same name. The twin brother of Shinobi has been murdered, Shinobi seeks revenge against Dragon the Killer. But Dragon wields the entity sword and a legion of cutthroats, but a ninja is scared of nothing. This ninja action fighting game for 2 players offers a breathtaking ninja fight at first with complicated fighting techniques. After that it works into a first person maze. More missions follow. We suggest that the more experienced player plays with Shinobi, although it may be hard to learn the moves for a beginner. This is because the levels are becoming harder and harder the further you get. We also suggest that both players play with a joystick just to be fair, especially the \"R\u00e4mpytys\" level.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1997", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Heikki Linnakangas", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANFknipvaNw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/163917-helsinki-force-1-the-holocaust\n"}
