{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tetris Pro", "overview": "The basic Tetris gameplay, involving arranging each shape as you are given them to create complete lines, and then adjust to the remaining fragments falling down a line and perhaps blocking off lower lines, was reinvented in this title. The game is split into levels, and each one requires a set number of lines to be completed. As you do so, you gradually reveal a cartoony picture, varying from semi-naked girls to candles. The levels usually have some amount of blocks already in place, which must be worked around, and often specify that picture lines are only awarded when you score 2 or more lines at a time. There are also power-ups, which come in some of the square blocks and are activated if you use them to complete a line. They include points bonuses, bombs to remove some of the existing tiles, and some \u2018power-downs\u2019, such as one which turns the screen upside down, and one that removes the preview of the piece.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Logic System", "publishers": "2000 A.D.", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.33", "wikipedia": "https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris_Pro", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/2buL6sNNB38?t=4m15s", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90555-tetris-pro\n"}
