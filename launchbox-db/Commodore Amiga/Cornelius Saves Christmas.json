{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cornelius Saves Christmas", "overview": "Cornelius is a child, young enough to still be excited about Christmas and not blame his parents for giving him such a goofy name. One day, on his way home from school, he overheard the owner of his town's only big store saying that he wouldn't be selling any Christmas trees or toys this Christmas. Although he couldn't understand anything the old man said, he realized that an evil wizard named A. C. Countant forced him to make that decision. Wasting no time, Cornelius decided to fight against the enchanted toys that were under the spell of the wizard and free all the trapped Christmas trees.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2009", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atropos Studios", "publishers": "Atropos Studios", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwakdZHdqnY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161823-cornelius-saves-christmas\n"}
