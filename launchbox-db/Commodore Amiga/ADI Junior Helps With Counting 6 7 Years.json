{"altername_name": ["ADI Junior Helps With Counting 6-7"], "name": "ADI Junior Helps With Counting 6/7 Years", "overview": "Counting with ADI Junior 6-7 is aimed at second year infants and leads to the Key Stage 1 Standard Assessment Tests (SATs) which are taken by all UK children at the age of 7. This disc takes them into the exciting theme of a fairground. The games they play help them not only with counting and number work, but also assist with pattern matching and spatial skills so necessary to a true understanding of math work. The average child would expect to succeed at Level 2 of the SATs. This program reinforces and develops the work begun in Counting with ADI Junior 4-5, but has some more challenging games to cater for the brighter, more advanced child who is expected to succeed at Level 3.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Coktel Vision", "publishers": "Europress Software", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/159283-adi-junior-helps-with-counting-67-years\n"}
