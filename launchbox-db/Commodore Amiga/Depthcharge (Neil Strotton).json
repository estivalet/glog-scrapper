Depthcharge is a single screen action game where the player is in control of a destroyer and has to destroy as many submarines as possible. The game is viewed from the side with the player being able to move the destroyer left and right along the surface of the sea. Beneath, multiple submarines appear at different depths and at different speeds that the player has to destroy by launching depth charges from the left or right side of the ship. A maximum amount of depth charges can be used at a time. Submarines eventually fire back at your ship, so watch out for torpedoes and other attacks.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Neil Strotton", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZokVe9eXSpY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/163771-depthcharge-neil-strotton\n"}
