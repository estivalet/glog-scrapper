{"altername_name": ["Super Seymour Saves the World"], "name": "Super Seymour Saves the Planet", "overview": "In the sequel to Seymour Goes to Hollywood, Seymour takes on his first movie role - as an eco-friendly superhero. With game design showing some obvious influence from Bomb Jack, Seymour jumps around a series of single screen areas collecting barrels of toxic waste. One barrel at a time is highlighted and is worth more points than the others, but will explode after a short countdown. Seymour is plagued by mutants which fly and bounce around the screen. Some must be jumped on from above, some must be hit from below.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "The Big Red Software Company", "publishers": "Codemasters Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cOXU4ZtgIc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/105010-super-seymour-saves-the-planet\n"}
