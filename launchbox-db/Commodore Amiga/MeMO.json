{"altername_name": [], "name": "MeMO", "overview": "Chances are that you have played a card memory game many times before... but not this way! MeMO is a card memory game whose peculiarity is that it allows two players to play simultaneously - that is, they can flip cards at the same time and battle for the best score! Also, it does not drive players mad due to bad luck, as unlucky moves are ignored - and, well, to say it all, lucky moves aren't rewarded either. With its neat graphics, which pay a little tribute to the Amiga and some of its games, and cool music, MeMO will take you for a pleasant trip down the memory (heh!) lane.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2011", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Retream", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YyQbO4NEw0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161185-memo\n"}
