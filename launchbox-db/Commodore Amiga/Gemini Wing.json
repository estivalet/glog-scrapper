{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gemini Wing", "overview": "Humans and aliens are living in harmony in the future, until a tabloid journalist stirs up hatred towards aliens. They respond by invading the planet, and it's down to the protagonist to clear up a situation scarily similar to reality in this arcade conversion. Gemini Wing is a vertically-scrolling shoot 'em up, which is distinguished by its unusual power-up system.

The organic backgrounds are detailed, and have many sections which fire at the player character.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Imagitec Design", "publishers": "16-Blitz", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_Wing", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/9540-gemini-wing\n"}
