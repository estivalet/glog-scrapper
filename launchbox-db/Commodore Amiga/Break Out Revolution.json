{"altername_name": [], "name": "Break Out Revolution", "overview": "Break Out Revolution is another Arkanoid clone. This one is done very well. The game play is very tight and the graphics are very nice too. The game has 2 modes, mode 1 is regular breakout. Mode 2 is an advanced type of breakout with lots of stuff happening during play like the ability to move the player platform up and down as opposed to just left and right in normal mode. There's also a lot of stuff falling down for you to collect when you break the bricks. It's one of the best unlicensed Arkanoid clones out there.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Oliver Michel", "publishers": "", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/131529-break-out-revolution\n"}
