{"altername_name": [], "name": "Croak!", "overview": "A variation of the classic arcade game Frogger, designed to make use of the Amiga's hardware. The basic gameplay involves guiding a frog into one of 7 home-bases at the top of the screen, which have hard barriers either side of them (avoid these). This involves first guiding him across a road, avoiding the vehicles, then over a river using moving logs. In this version the road has a variety of machinery to dodge, ranging from standard cars to lorries - hitting one kills your frog and leaves a red splodge in that part of the screen - a nice touch. The rivers also have families of turtles appearing intermittently - these can be used to cross a level, but they don't stay up for long. There's also a 2-player mode in which both players compete to get into the same slots - player 2 using a yellow frog. You have a 60 second time limit for each frog on the first level, and 5 lives at the start. Once all 7 slots are filled, you get a 50-point bonus for each one, and move on to the next level. Progressively you have less and less time, more traffic, less logs, and a few other difficulty elements - the part in between the road and river has a chicken marching across to avoid, and a crow swoops overhead ready to grab your frog.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Selwyn Stevens", "publishers": "Amiga Format", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/89402-croak\n"}
