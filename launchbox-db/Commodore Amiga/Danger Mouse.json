{"altername_name": [], "name": "Danger Mouse", "overview": "Danger Mouse, the PD game, doesn't actually owe anything to the original cartoon other than its graphics, and is as such nothing more than a Hunchback clone. For those youngsters out there, Hunchback was a very early game, where you had to cross a number of increasingly hazardous screens to ring a bell, finally rescuing Esmeralda. The dangers came in the form of flying arrows, bottomless pits, fireballs and guards trying to stick poles at you. It was nothing more than a timing and reactions game, but in its day was a classic. So what's to tell about the mouse of danger? Well not a lot really. It's quite nicely programmed, and features some groovy samples of the original music and voices. The game play really adds nothing new to the Hunchback genre other than a few pick-up icons that award speed or exit the level. Not bad, and a nice reminder of a nice character, but not stunning.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gerred Blyth", "publishers": "Gerred Blyth", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/89847-danger-mouse\n"}
