{"altername_name": [], "name": "After the War", "overview": "Year 2019, Manhattan. After a nuclear war. Out of the ashes comes a hero, Jonathan Rogers, better known as \"Jungle Rogers\", the owner of the asphalt jungle. The only chance of survival is to reach the airdrop platform XV-238, located in the control base of the schizophrenic assassin professor McJerin, and to escape to outer colonies. There is no easy way to do this. The game is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up, with thugs coming at you constantly, and a few moves to use on them. You must cross the dangerous streets of Manhattan, which have become over-run by feral thieves. Later you await the guardians of the scientific complex of McJerin.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dinamic Software", "publishers": "Dinamic Software", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.12", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/After_the_War_%28video_game%29", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/23813-after-the-war\n"}
