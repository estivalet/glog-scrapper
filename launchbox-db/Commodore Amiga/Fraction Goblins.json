{"altername_name": [], "name": "Fraction Goblins", "overview": "An educational text adventure with still pictures from Caroline and Ian Coombe and released in 1991. Y\u1ecdu\u031f have been invited to go, and play with your friends, the Fraction Goblins and have spent a messy hour or two with them in their Art Room. The problem is that the young goblins were learning Borrowing, at school today and they were set some homework. So, while you were taken to the kitchen for a snack, the goblins did their homework, using the contents of your pencil case. You return, to the Art Room to find that your pencil case has been ransacked. All you have to do now is find the contents again. 3 pens, 4 pencils, 4 crayons, a rubber, a sharpener, a ruler and the key to your bicycle padlock. Oh, by the way, if you meet any of the older goblins as you wander round the caves, they may make you answer a fractions problem before they will let you pass. If you get stuck, you can cheat a little bit. Type in the word HELP for some magical assistance.
