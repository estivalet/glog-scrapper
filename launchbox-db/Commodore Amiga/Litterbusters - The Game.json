To do this you pick up the cans, bottles or newspapers scattered around. You can only reach the bus stop where they are all collected. Sometimes doors need to be opened. To do this you have to hold all the keys. Also, to walk over a rubbish tip you need a bag to put the rubbish in. There are three types of invisible objects: walls, man-holes (which kill you) and extra lives.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Patsoft", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QaQMOKsedI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164138-litterbusters-the-game\n"}
