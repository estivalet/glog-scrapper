{"altername_name": [], "name": "Challenge Golf", "overview": "If you have a pair of checked trousers and an equally loud shirt, then tee off with Challenge Golf. The game takes you to the four corners of the globe to play in four megabuck tournaments, battling to sink that little white ball on grass which looks alike a green carpet. Between one and four players can compete in Challenge Golf. It's best to start with the driving range, which is a 10-ball practice session. If you're a quick learner, though, you'll soon be skilled enough to put yourself down as a pro. Otherwise, be honest and own up to being a rank amateur or a novice. Once out on the fairway the game lacks the excitement of a real-life tournament and the feel of match play. The graphics are functional rather than flash-harry, but fail to instill a sense of 'being there'.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Showroom Dummies", "publishers": "On-Line Entertainment", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/88860-challenge-golf\n"}
