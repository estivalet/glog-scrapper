Units of length / Units of masses and capacities / Problems on scales / Problems of perimeters / Units of areas / Units of volumes / Shifts on an axis / Markings in the plane (abscissa, ordinate, negative numbers) / Examples of graphic functions. Properties of parallelograms / Corresponding, opposite, alternate angles.../ Vertices of the angles of a triangle / Circumscribed circle / Center of symmetry / Planes in space (parallel and perpendicular) / Development of solids / Pyramids, prisms, cylinders / Area of the parallelogram, of the trapezium, of the disc.../ Problems on volumes. Usual units of the metric system / Scales / Perimeters / Units of time / Conversions of durations / Calculations on durations / Problems of speeds / Units of areas and volumes / Works in an orthonormal frame / Situations of proportionality: graphic representations. Midpoint theorem / Orthogonal projections / Distance from a point to a straight line / Cosine / Triangular inequality / Particularities of triangles / Medians, medians, heights, bisectors / Pythagorean theorem and its converse / Complex polygons / Geometry in space / Sphere and ball / Vectors and translations/Rotations. Usual units (lengths, masses, capacities, areas, volumes) / Calculations of perimeters, areas, volumes / Calculations on durations / Works in an orthonormal frame / Linear applications and proportionality/ Graphical representations of linear maps. Vectors and translations / Chasles' relation / Operations on vectors (addition, subtraction, multiplication) / Midpoint of a vector / Trigonometry in the right triangle cosine, sine, tangent / Complementary angles / Thales' theorem and its converse / Transformations (translations, symmetries, rotations) / Inscribed angle, central angle / Measurement of an arc of a circle / Pyramids and cones. Revisions on the usual units (lengths, masses, capacities, durations, areas, volumes) / Calculations of areas and volumes / Distance of two points in an orthonormal frame / Line equations / Direction coefficient / Affine applications (properties, determination) / Graphical resolution of equations. Each software includes around thirty different modules, hundreds of exercises and associated aids. You also have a calculator, a notepad and an electronic calendar. \"CONTROLS\" modules allow you each quarter to check and note the progress of the achievements. The \"REVIEWS\" show you the progress made as well as the weak points to work on. Each software is an ideal complement of support tool that will accompany the student throughout the school year.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "G\u00e9n\u00e9ration 5", "publishers": "G\u00e9n\u00e9ration 5", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/368070-lessentiel-en-mathematiquegeometriemesuresfonctions-6eme\n"}
