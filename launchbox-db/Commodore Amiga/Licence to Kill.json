Your aim is to avenge the death of Felix Leiter, who was killed by the drug baron Sanchez. Technically the game consists of several different vertical scrolling action sequences. In each stage you must fly, drive or walk through a preset terrain. While doing that, you have to shoot enemies, avoid their shots and collect items (mainly ammunition).
