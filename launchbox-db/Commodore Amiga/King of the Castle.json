{"altername_name": [], "name": "King of the Castle", "overview": "The year is 3842 and King Aquard has decided it's time to pass on the throne to his son Mordane. In order to do this he has to pass on the ancient scroll in an official public ceremony. This is easier said than done, the scroll has been destroyed by fire and without the scroll the right to the crown can be challenged, this has happened, Sir Gallaid has officially challenged for the right to rule, some say his men started the fire but nothing can be proved. Sir Gallaid has already started to try and discredit the Royal Family by letting it leak out that the scroll has been destroyed and that if they let it be destroyed they have no right to rule, King Aquard has managed to stall for a while but the people are becoming restless. This is where you come in, the History books tell of a tine in the middle ages when the whole of the male population old enough to fight went on a Crusade and the women and children went to a neighboring Kingdom. The scroll was protected by some crude but effective traps, many tried to steal it but non succeeded. You are to go back in time and try where others have failed. The time machine will not penetrate stone so you will be transported to a place outside the walls of the Castle", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1997", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bendisoft", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/372769-king-of-the-castle\n"}
