{"altername_name": [], "name": "Lost on Parrot Island", "overview": "Lost on Parrot Island is a point and click adventure game with an interface similar to early LucasArts adventures. After a shipwreck the player character finds himself on an island in the middle of the Pacific ocean. The task ahead is simple: find a way to leave the island. The player moves around the island screen by screen by clicking on the scenery while other interactions are done with the control panel's six verb command buttons: use, push, talk to, look at, open, close, give and take. Items found around the island can be picked up and will be placed in an eight slot inventory. These can then be used to interact with the game world.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "September 3, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Frank Otto", "publishers": "APC&TCP", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161568-lost-on-parrot-island\n"}
