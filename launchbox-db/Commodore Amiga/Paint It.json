{"altername_name": [], "name": "Paint It", "overview": "A maze style game for both English and German language players created by Harald M\u00fcller (Mueller) and released on the Gamers' Delight compilation. Block in the playing field section by section while avoiding the roaming ball and other pop-up items. The game starts up very easily where you can always work in a place the roaming ball is not, but after a while the places you can work are fewer and fewer. Hit the freeze pop-up to freeze the ball in place for a short time. When the whole playing field is \"painted\" you can move to the next level.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Harald M\u00fcller", "publishers": "Schatztruhe", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt5sAuqP4C8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161881-paint-it\n"}
