{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cubix", "overview": "Cubix is a Puzzle game, developed by Xtreme D-Sign and published by Media GmbH, which was released in Europe in 1991. It's so difficult to write anything meaningful about these puzzle games. They are usually well made, with adequate graphics and music. They are neither excellent nor terrible. Just competent, moderately fun games for people who like this genre. Cubix is one in hundreds of puzzle games for the Amiga. Should you play this one instead of the others? I don't know. There is no meaningful standard to measure it against because these games are so similar.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Xtreme D-Sign", "publishers": "media", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/85728-cubix\n"}
