{"altername_name": [], "name": "Colours", "overview": "Colours is a fast-paced puzzle game in which the player eliminates coloured squares that are approaching the centre area from 4 sides. In order to eliminate the other colours, you must point your piece at it and 'fire'. If the colour is the same colour as your piece, the square is eliminated, as well as all of the shapes of the same colour behind it, until your piece hits a piece of a different colour. If the square is of a different colour, or it is hit when collecting a line of similar shapes, your piece exchanges colours with the shape. Features include a high score table and a serial-link option for two players.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Carsten Magerkurt", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7I9NbWHWwQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162478-colours\n"}
