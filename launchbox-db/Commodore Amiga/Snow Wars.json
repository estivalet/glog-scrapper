Try to score the highest as wave after wave of enemies appear! There may be a polar bear or two as well... Use joystick 2 to move left and right. Press and hold the fire button between the trees to build a snowball. You can build small, medium and large. Push up on the joystick when you are below a snowball to throw it.
