{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mattix", "overview": "It's all a numbers game in this two-player only puzzler from Alon Fliess and Alon Ginosar. Player 1 plays numbers in the horizontal, player two plays numbers in the vertical. The option is to collect higher numbers than the other player. The game will be over when all the numbers in the row or column has finished. The winner will be the one who has more points. Seems way too simple, but it is a beast to play.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Alon Fliess", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2XCF28fC-8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164225-mattix\n"}
