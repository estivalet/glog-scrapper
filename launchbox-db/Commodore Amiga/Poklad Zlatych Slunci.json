The game was programmed by Charon Software in 1992 and distributed by Vochozka. Poklad Zlat\u00fd Slunc\u00ed is probably the first original domestic Amiga game sold for money. Just like the older Duck Tales(1991) from ZX Spectra, we will take on Uncle Skrbl\u00edk here . One day he is reading a newspaper and finds an article about a treasure that pirates have hidden somewhere in the Valley of the Golden Suns . However, no one knows where this place is located. It is only known that there is a map for it, where one half is owned by the penguins from the Museum of Colors and will not release it after good. The other half then got lost somewhere. Coincidentally, the nephews are cleaning so frantically in our house that they swing the chandelier in our study, which falls and reveals a roll of paper with the second part of the map. The sight of enormous wealth motivates us to immediately drop everything and go on an adventure.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Charon Software", "publishers": "Vochozka Trading", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/373700-poklad-zlatych-slunci\n"}
