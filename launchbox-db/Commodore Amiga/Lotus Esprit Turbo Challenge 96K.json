There are 19 computer opponents (15 on the 8-bit versions) and you have to finish in the top 10 (top 8 on the 8-bits) to progress.

In most races you will have to make a pitstop for fuel in order to reach the finish. The tracks include features such as oil slicks, roadworks, boulders and rivers - contact with these (or the other cars) will slow you, but there is no car damage model.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "March 28, 2005", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Scarab", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "0.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/369630-lotus-esprit-turbo-challenge-96k\n"}
