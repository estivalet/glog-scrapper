{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bubble Gun", "overview": "Bubble Gun is an Action game, developed and published by Weathermine, which was released in Europe in 1994. The story behind Bubblegun is a simple one. You are a small crocodile with a gun that can fire bubbles (hence the inspired name) who is trapped in a castle and has to find their way to freedom. Quite why they are trapped in a castle, or why they are carrying a large gun, or indeed why they are trying to escape isn\u2019t made clear at any point, but then who really takes any notice of game plots these days? What you are left wit is a very basic platform game, where you begin somewhere in the middle of a four-way scrolling maze. Dotted around the maze are a variety of objects, such as points bonuses, energy bonuses and time bonuses, but the most important things to look out for are sections of keys. You can carry three items at once, and there are three sections to each coloured key, so it isn\u2019t too much trouble to build up a complete key. Once you have the key built, all you need to do is find the chest with a coloured lock that matches it. Open the lock and fruit and gems fall out. If you\u2019re really lucky, a block with \u201cExit\u201d written on it will appear. This is the key that opens the level exit, and is the one thing you are looking for.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "WeatherMine Software", "publishers": "WeatherMine Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.12", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/63021-bubble-gun\n"}
