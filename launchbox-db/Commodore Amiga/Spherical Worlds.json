{"altername_name": [], "name": "Spherical Worlds", "overview": "Spherical Worlds, as the name doesn't imply, is a two-dimensional adventure in which you take control of a spherical droid whose mission it is to roam the various sectors of a space station. On loading the game, you are presented with just two options: Start Game or Enter Teleport Code. The game itself is fairly slow going - your spherical battle droid has to skid about a derelict space station, avoiding holes, sliding over ice, shooting other little robots and things, while searching for the exit to the next level. On level two, it gets harder... There's not much in Spherical Worlds to get you hooked - yes, you can upgrade your weapons and you get to do all sorts of exciting things like use teleports and collect keys - but the graphics are small and uneventful, as is the gameplay. It's okay in a sub Alien Breed 1 and 2 sort of way, and there are a few marginally distracting moments, but it doesn't hold your attention for long.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "4-Matted", "publishers": "neo", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo33KSmMAuY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73095-spherical-worlds\n"}
