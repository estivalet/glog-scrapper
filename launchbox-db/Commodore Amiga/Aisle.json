{"altername_name": [], "name": "Aisle", "overview": "A common criticism of adventure games generally and works of interactive fiction specifically is that they oftentimes suffer from what have been characterized as \"read-the-designer's-mind\" puzzles -- making necessary apparently arbitrary (and sometimes seemingly absurd) actions that produce unreasonable-to-expect results; the puzzles look kosher in a walkthrough but only make sense to a player after the fact, knowing of their implausible effect. Aisle is the inverse: the designer has instead had to read the player's mind, predicting which actions, likely or unlikely, the player is apt to attempt in the somewhat under-stimulating environment (certainly an unusually pedestrian game setting) of the Italian foods section of a supermarket late one Thursday night. Rather than the player wandering the market and interacting with objects contained there in the conventional adventuring fashion, this game permits the player only a single move... that move triggering a memory, hinting at a roiling and turbulent backstory that can only be more fully appreciated by unlocking more recollections. Upon completion of the single move, the protagonist leaves the market and the game concludes -- then restarts, giving the player another crack at glimpsing another, parallel facet of the memories the shelves of pasta provoke.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "May 28, 1999", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sam Barlow", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aisle_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/159301-aisle\n"}
