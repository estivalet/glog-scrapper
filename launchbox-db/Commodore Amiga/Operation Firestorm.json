{"altername_name": [], "name": "Operation Firestorm", "overview": "Operation Firestorm is a good old fashioned 'lone soldier against the world' affair, with you looking ever so slightly Green Berret-ish as you wander across a backdrop of gun turrets, tanks, grenade launchers and enemy snipers. As tradition dictates, each level has a set look with a relevant guardian at the end. You may find yourself up against anything from an enormous tank, to a big automated gun in a ball. Upgrade you weapons by searching crates, which also hide health and lives.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Phil Ruston", "publishers": "F1 Licenceware", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhZtDqHRSEk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109674-operation-firestorm\n"}
