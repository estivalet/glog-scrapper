{"altername_name": [], "name": "Highway Sprint", "overview": "Highway Sprint was developed by a team of people such as Erik Hogan, Koyot1122 and Simone Bernacchia. Looked to feature non stop racing fun as you race along a road at dangerous speeds while also trying not to crash into other cars. You can set the number of AI drivers, but the speed has been turned down to make things a little less frustrating and to let you deal with more turns and added curves.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "December 2, 2017", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Earok", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164893-highway-sprint\n"}
