You must run a maze, gathering flowers, while avoiding a pirate. Then, it is off to the Mermaid Lagoon. You must click on each mermaid so Peter can jump rocks to get to Wendy. After that, you move to a tree with a playhouse. You must click around to find the hiding children, like hide-and-seek. Finally, it is off to Captain Hook's ship, the Jolly Roger, where you must run a maze, avoiding three pirates, to get to and rescue Wendy.
