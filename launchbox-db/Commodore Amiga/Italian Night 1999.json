{"altername_name": [], "name": "Italian Night 1999", "overview": "Milano, 1999. A mysterious car crash takes the life of entrepreneur Victor Erni. Private eye Duomo is hired by Erni's widow to investigate on the case, but he has only twelve hours before the police declares it a mere accident. The main gameplay screen is based on a real map of Milan's city centre, from which the player has to pick a destination among a vast selection of real-life streets, squares and plazas. Each movement accelerates an in-game countdown representing the time limit to solve the case. A first-person, point-and-click interface provides the main mean of interaction with characters and locations, the latter being generally represented by still images. The game is set entirely during night time, thus enhancing its neo-noir feel. Since there are no language options, the game is only playable in Italian.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Simulmondo", "publishers": "Simulmondo", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/127889-italian-night-1999\n"}
