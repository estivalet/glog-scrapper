{"altername_name": [], "name": "Kalle Kloakk", "overview": "Megastyle is proud to release this Amiga version of Kalle Kloakk to you all. This game has been a pain in the neck for me as a coder, there has been tons of moments that I have been thinking of putting this project on ice. But, the bugs and the things that needed to get sorted out with the game has been sorted out. And with good motivation vibes from my team I got it done. So, the Amiga version is based on the same game as the C64 version, the story is the same and you exit to the right as always after all the toilet papers has been picked up. You will see a door when all the paper has been picked up. This is more like eye candy for your eyes, but, you can still exit anywhere on the right side of the screen. The game is built up on a Dual Playfield with 3 bitplanes on each playfield for the extra athmosphere feeling. And the game looks so much better too, better than a black background, won't you agree? Anyway; Have fun playing the game!", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "May 10, 2023", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Megastyle", "publishers": "itch.io", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/368737-kalle-kloakk\n"}
