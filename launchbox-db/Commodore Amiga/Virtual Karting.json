{"altername_name": [], "name": "Virtual Karting", "overview": "Very much the most serious go-karting simulation even seen, Virtual Karting gives a texture-mapped world running at at least 25fps. There are 3 different circuits on offer, to be raced in any order, each with a full field of computer opponents to face. The AI has a very rigid feel, and it's one of those racing games where they're better thought of as a succession of obstacles, sticking to the same racing line, and carrying on unscathed from contact even if you spin. There are several different viewpoints on offer, both 2D overhead and 3D. Especially on the Advanced course, some corners are very tight, and the run-off areas quite sluggish to rejoin from.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "OTM Publications & Promotions", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/115614-virtual-karting\n"}
