{"altername_name": [], "name": "Adventures Through Time: The Scavenger Hunt", "overview": "Adventures Through Time is a sci-fi adventure game where you take on the role of Douglas Walker Jr., a.k.a. \u201cBuck\u201d, the young son of a time-traveller. The game begins in your bedroom early in the morning, some time in the year 2059. Your father has left you home alone for the day while he goes out to a convention, and unknown to him, you and a group of your friends have something planned: you are going to hijack his time machine and use it for a scavenger hunt -- one that will make history. The game interface is a hybrid of graphic adventure and text adventure: the top half of the screen displays the current scene, including the main character in third-person view, while underneath is a scrolling-text window that describes each action as it happens. Commands can be typed in, but you can also use the mouse: on the right side of the text window is a small panel of buttons, six verb action buttons, a left-arrow and right-arrow that cause the main character to start walking across the room in that direction, and a \u201cJump\u201d button to immediately leap into the air. You can click object hotspots in the scene to select them, as well.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Aurum Software", "publishers": "Aurum Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/74063-adventures-through-time-the-scavenger-hunt\n"}
