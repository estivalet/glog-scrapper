Pond can run very quickly (by holding down the A button) through large levels, which often contain steep mountain sides and other tricky areas. Once again, he has to oppose the evil scientist Maybe and his minions.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "VectorDean", "publishers": "Millennium Interactive", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.85", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Pond_3", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GwL0OiV0gE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/9823-james-pond-3-operation-starfi5h\n"}
