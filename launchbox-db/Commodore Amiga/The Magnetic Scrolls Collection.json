{"altername_name": ["The Magnetic Scrolls Collection Vol. 1"], "name": "The Magnetic Scrolls Collection", "overview": "More than a compilation, this collection brings three Magnetic Scrolls' hits, now enhanced to run under Wonderland's Magnetic Windows game environment: Fish! - The Seven Deadly Fins, an inter-dimensional group of anarchists, are on the loose. 'THE PROJECT' has been sabotaged... can you, a mere goldfish, save the day? Fish! is full of what you least expect, lacking all that's rational and devoid of all good sense. Corruption - Outwardly you're on the fast track to success in the City. But what corruption lurks menacingly just beneath the glittering facade? Corruption is a racy thriller where the only person you can trust is yourself. The Guild of Thieves - How sneaky can you get? The answer is 'VERY' to stand an earthly chance of qualifying for entry into the famed Guild of Thieves. In The Guild of Thieves, treasure abounds but can you find and steal it all?", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "magnetic Scrolls", "publishers": "Virgin Games", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_Scrolls", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/127922-the-magnetic-scrolls-collection\n"}
