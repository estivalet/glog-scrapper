{"altername_name": [], "name": "Great Napoleonic Battles", "overview": "Great Napoleonic Battles is a turn-based hex wargame which not only allows players to play three epic battles from the Napoleonic Wars but also includes a construction kit to re-create any land-based battle of the Napoleonic period. It consists of four programs: a 'Battle' program to play scenarios; a 'Mapmaker' to customise or create new maps; a 'Menmaker to create or modify units and pieces used in the battles; and a 'Warmaker' to modify rules, objectives and conditions of combat. The game comes with three ready-made scenarios - the battles of Marengo and Waterloo, where you play the French, and the battle of Quatre Bras where you play the British. Players can choose to play either side in a user-created scenario, or create two-player scenarios.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Impressions Games", "publishers": "Impressions Games", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/94284-great-napoleonic-battles\n"}
