{"altername_name": [], "name": "Starbase 13", "overview": "Starbase 13 is a sci-fi point & click adventure game for the Amiga, created in AMOS. It uses a LucasArts-style action bar with seven actions: \"Walk\", \"Examine\", \"Operate\", \"Use\", \"Take\", \"Talk\" and \"Shoot\". \"Use\" and \"Operate\" are separate because \"Use\" always involves two objects as in \"Use (...) with (...)\", while the \"Operate\" action always involves one object. There are five save game slots that you can save to using keys F6-F10, and load from with keys F1-F5. Starbase 13's pathfinding algorithm is a little temperamental, and sometimes you may need to manually guide the character around obstacles by clicking several points along the way. The hero of the game is Yeno Hou, a member of the crew on the Starship 8.3. In the introduction, he is summoned by the captain and given a mission to investigate a space station that has been broadcasting a distress signal. Unlike in some graphic adventures, it is possible to die in Starbase 13, and some parts require quick reflexes to succeed. Starbase 13 was followed by a sequel in 1995, titled \"Epsilon 9: Revenge of the Stingons\".", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "DTO Software", "publishers": "DTO Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZoZZrOAtUE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161574-starbase-13\n"}
