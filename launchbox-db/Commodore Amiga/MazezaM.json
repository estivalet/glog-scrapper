{"altername_name": [], "name": "MazezaM", "overview": "MazezaM is a puzzle game, where the player has to pass through the levels by sliding the walls to left and right, opening corridors between. The rules seem simple, but the game gets harder and harder as the stages go on further. Sometime, the reach to the end seem unsolvable, but there is always a solution at the beginning. If a level is rendered by the player unsolvable, there is a possibility for a replay in the room from the initial position, but this is at the cost of a life. After all the lives are used, the game is over and have to be started again from the first level. If the level room is passed, the player is rewarded with extra life, which comes handy in the next levels. The newest Amiga version have fourty-two levels, talking intro and nice outro sequence. Some of the rooms are small and very easy to overcome, but some of them are wide and a real headache to pass.
