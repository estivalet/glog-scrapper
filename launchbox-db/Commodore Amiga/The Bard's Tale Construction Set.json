{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Bard's Tale Construction Set", "overview": "The Bard's Tale Construction Set was created by Interplay Productions in 1991 and distributed by Electronic Arts. It was released for the Amiga and DOS. This game creator is much easier to use than most of the others I have come across, which means that with a bit of effort you will actually be able to create a finished game. The downside is that all of the games will superficially look the same. All creation requires perspiration, and to create a game which really has something different in it, you will need to spend a long time wrestling with the more awkward aspects of the package, namely the graphics and the special logic sections. This type of open-ended software is what computers are really about. It is unlikely that you are ever to create a game which will make you money, but the weeks of creative fun contained in the box will be its own reward.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Interplay Productions", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Sandbox", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bard%27s_Tale_Construction_Set", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/61700-the-bards-tale-construction-set\n"}
