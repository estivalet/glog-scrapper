{"altername_name": [], "name": "Shroom Gammon", "overview": "Released in a full commercial version and a PD Demo version that does not include the ability to use the computer player. A game of backgammon where the pieces are \"mushies\" and you need to get them all across the board based on your random die rolls. Follows standard backgammon rules. Pieces on the bank must be moved before other pieces can proceed. If you can go, you must go unless there is no legal move. The game is over when one player removes all their pieces from the field. BackGammon points awarded if the other player still has pieces on his half of the board, Gammon awarded if no pieces in the back section, but no pieces yet removed and a simple win if you were both in process of removing pieces. Optional rules can be set to limit stacking to 5 pieces. Change how rolling 2 of the same die are handled and so forth.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Daisy Software", "publishers": "Daisy Software", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSBzg-9j89g", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162566-shroom-gammon\n"}
