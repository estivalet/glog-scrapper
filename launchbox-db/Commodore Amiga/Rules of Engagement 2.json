{"altername_name": [], "name": "Rules of Engagement 2", "overview": "One of the most replayable games of all time, Rules of Engagement 2 is a strategic starship combat that could be integrated with tactical-level Breach 3. The interface, although logical, is dauntingly detailed. Those who take the time to scale the steep learning curve, however, will find their patience well rewarded with deep and challenging gameplay. It's sequel is an updated version that is even better than the original, with a campaign builder and integrates with strategic-level Breach 3. Rules of Engagement 2 is, like it's predecessor, a rare chance for the player to engage in involved and detailed space warfare. It's obvious that the game system has not been whipped up in a hurry, and that the programmers have really made an effort to provide us with a game of epic proportions and plenty of depth. They have not completely taken advantage of the opportunity to bring more \u201csexiness\u201d and immediate appeal to what is already a very solid game indeed.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Omnitrend", "publishers": "Impressions", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72991-rules-of-engagement-2\n"}
