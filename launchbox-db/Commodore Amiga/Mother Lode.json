{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mother Lode", "overview": "This is Mother Lode by Joe Rumsey (Night Owl Software), yet another good Lode Runner clone of sorts, The basic principle here is exactly the same as the other Lode Runner games You start off flashing, in this mode the game is in effect \u201cPaused\u201d so it gives you time to study the level, and plan your route to collect all the Gold Bars, and then finally head for freedom at the top of the level You have to collect the Gold Bars while avoiding the Red Men who will come after you, although the AI is a little strange at times and you will find them getting confused quite easily, you can easily avoid the Red Men by digging a hole, and standing back so that they will fall into the hole, thereby allowing you to walk over their heads and carry on the platform, However they only stay in the hole for a short time, before they leap back out and then proceed to hunt you down (unless the hole fills in, in that case, it will kill them and they will respawn at the top of the screen, flashing for a few seconds, before again coming after you) You can climb the ladders and swing off the ropes (shown as lines on the screen) and even fall off the rope half-way so collect any Gold Bars which maybe suspended in mid-air, this is also a quick way to escape the Red Men, as you can go across the rope, let go, although as you do, any Men following you will also let go, and fall down, so you need to vacate the area quickly before they land nearby and start hunting you down again To clear a level, you must collect all the Gold Bars, then proceed to the very top of the screen, at which point you will clear the level and the next one will show, then you will start flashing so you can have a good look at the level before moving, which will then start the game again", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Night Owl Design", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqoKZOI0New", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162758-mother-lode\n"}
