{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Official Honda NSR-R Simulator", "overview": "Official Honda NSR-R Simulator is a Racing game, developed by Digiteam and published by Edigamma, which was released in Europe in 1989. You must use TUTA (coveralls), GUANTI (gloves) and CASCO (helmet) to play the game! Use joystick (NOT mouse!) to toggle, once done select VIA! (go!). Avoid excess revolutions of your engine at all costs, i. e. do not make your tachometer enter the red area under any circumstances, because: when you start up the engine, and you enter the red area, you may receive very high penalty points which may leave your score at 0 points, so remember to change gears rather too early than too late;", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Digiteam", "publishers": "Edigamma", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161263-the-official-honda-nsr-r-simulator\n"}
