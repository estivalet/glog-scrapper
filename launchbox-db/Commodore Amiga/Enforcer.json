{"altername_name": ["Atmosfear"], "name": "Enforcer", "overview": "ENFORCER demo is available on Vulcan's CD. Known as both Atmosfear and Enforcer, this is a very early version of a fake Doom clone written in AMOS. The selection of three weapons are standard; a pistol, shotgun and machine/plasma gun. Some sound and graphics, including the hand and pistol image, seem to have made a jump from Doom directly! A few monsters appear and attack from all directions. It\u2019s similar to Death Mask in that no real time 3D or texture mapping is involved. The first person view is created using the old Dungeon Master technique but some nifty animation makes the transition between blocks smooth. When walking forward the view bobs up and down and progresses convincingly. Similarly, turning around on the spot looks right, because the background is being scrolled horizontally to simulate the changing panorama. The bogus Doom style has its drawbacks in this case and produces a maze which is like the lines in graph paper. It\u2019s excessively uniform and perhaps the limitations of the demo prevented further development. Vulcan would later publish Marble Eyes\u2019 Genetic Species, so perhaps they realized the limitations of the fake style and went for the real thing instead.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Vulcan Software", "publishers": "", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/371002-enforcer\n"}
