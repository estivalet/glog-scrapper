{"altername_name": ["B.Castle"], "name": "BCastle", "overview": "A compilation of three solitaire card games published in a Amiga Computing cover disk: Beleaguered castle, Citadel and Streets and alleys. All three are variations on the same theme, with eight shuffled stacks of cards surrounding three pads where cards of the same colour must be stacked from the ace and upwards. To speed up graphics, moving cards are rendered not in full size, but as a small icon. The pull-down menus let you find a specific card in the stacks, show all remaining moves, undo moves or enter the cheat mode.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "May 4, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Amiga Computing", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/160363-bcastle\n"}
