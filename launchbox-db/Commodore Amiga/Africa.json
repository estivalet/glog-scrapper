{"altername_name": [], "name": "Africa", "overview": "Africa is a strategy game where the world powers (played by up to five human or CPU players) compete for dominance in southern Africa. It is based on a 1977 board game by World Wide Wargames (3W). The game takes place on a hexagonal map of sub-Saharan Africa, with the spheres of influence indicated by different colors. Hexagons with a thick white outline are cities, which serve as recruiting sites and bastions for armies. Each round begins by letting each player spend his allotted money on monetary support to his client states, destabilization of enemy clients, sending in an intervention force, recruiting juntas or rebel leaders, and building stability in client states. During the round, each player places new armies (including rebel armies in enemy states), moves them, and attacks opposing factions. Unless the force is overwhelming, the winner is decided by a throw of dice, and the (surviving) loser backs off into his own territory. If a defeated army has no retreat route, it is eliminated. Though the game by default takes place during the cold war, there is an option to use colonial names for states and cities instead.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "May 19, 2006", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Amigan Software", "publishers": "Amigan Software", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "5", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5rDvF70Efk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162914-africa\n"}
