Up to four players may compete in a hunt for four stars hidden inside blocks, blowing up the blocks with their bombs \u2014 or blowing each other up. There are various other items on the screen, such as extra bombs, liquor bottles which reverse the controls, a gun to shoot blocks, speed-ups, a stop sign that halts all other players and a skul that makes you lose all you've picked up.
