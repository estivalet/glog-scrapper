{"altername_name": [], "name": "Yachting", "overview": "This is a game written in AMOS 3-D. It is the first game of its kind that I have seen anywhere. You are sailing a yacht in a race around a bay, navigating around marker buoys and trying to beat your opponents. This game has atmosphere! The display moves up and down just like the real thing with all the appropriate creaks etc you'd expect to hear when sailing.
