{"altername_name": ["Tittris v0.5b"], "name": "Tittris", "overview": "Tittris from Richard Fhagher aka Dawnbringer is an early prototype of a game. Connect 5 of a shape or colour vertically or horizontally to remove those shapes. However only horizontal lines count against the level line removal goal. Nicely presented, as you'd expect from Dawnbringer, and it soon gets tough as shapes drop faster and you lose if your planning to connect the colour or the shape.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2001", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Richard Fhager", "publishers": "", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKA9Wwbyv1U", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164719-tittris\n"}
