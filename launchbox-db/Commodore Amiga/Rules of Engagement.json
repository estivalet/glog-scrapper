{"altername_name": [], "name": "Rules of Engagement", "overview": "One of the most replayable games of all time, Rules of Engagement 1 is a strategic starship combat that could be integrated with tactical-level Breach 2. Breach 2 is an detailed simulation of tactical level combat with more details than previous Breach and fits as a tactical subset into Rules of Engagement through Omnitrend's innovative \u201cInterlocking Game System\u201d. The interface in RoE, although logical, is dauntingly detailed. Those who take the time to scale the steep learning curve, however, will find their patience well rewarded with deep and challenging gameplay. It's sequel is an updated version that is even better than the original, with a campaign builder and integrates with strategic-level Breach 3. In all, one of the best starship command simulations ever released.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Omnitrend", "publishers": "Mindcraft", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72989-rules-of-engagement\n"}
