{"altername_name": [], "name": "Shoot 'em Baddies", "overview": "Shoot 'em Baddies is exactly what it says. And that's all you'll have to do to complete the game. It might be offensive if taken seriously but in fact the characters portrayed in this production are wholly fictitious and any resemblance to any person or persons are totally coincidental. That aside, the game will test your reflex skill and mouse control to an extreme you may otherwise never reach. For this reason, you have a selection of difficulties which cater to ages 6 to 60. Your hosts during this game have created a set from which your finer qualities may, or may not, be extracted. Qualities such as mercy, budgeting and reflex among other physical talents such as observation. Visit the shop to spend earned funds to shoot baddies better, faster and more explosively. DO not shoot civilians. If they do not carry a gun, you should consider them civilians until proven otherwise. Once you have cleared the area, look to the doors and windows for any other assailants.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "August 10, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Digital Ninja", "publishers": "", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZ5vb8wEH9M", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161703-shoot-em-baddies\n"}
