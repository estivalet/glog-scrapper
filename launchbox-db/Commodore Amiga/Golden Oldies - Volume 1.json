{"altername_name": ["Golden Oldies Vol. 1"], "name": "Golden Oldies: Volume 1", "overview": "Probably the first retro-collection ever foisted upon the buying public, [Golden Oldies is a] collection of 4 classic computer games (well, 3 computer games and an adaptation of an electronic video game). Play Eliza, Conway's Life, Crowther's Adventure, or Al Alcorn's Pong. All 4 games are liberal adaptations- there is no standard Eliza, and this versions seems to lack compared to others. Pong is an ASCII rendition of the game (and includes a remake with color!) Life, however, includes various pre-formed populations, including the infamous glider-gun that figures prominently in the book \"Hackers\" The games are not as fun as their originals, but they are good enough to give you a good sense of nostalgia... and a peek of how gaming looked in 1984. Recommended if you collect oldies, but probably won't be of interest to a casual gamer.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Software Country", "publishers": "Software Country", "genres": "", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/101789-golden-oldies-volume-1\n"}
