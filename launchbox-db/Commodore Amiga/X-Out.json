{"altername_name": [], "name": "X-Out", "overview": "X-Out is a horizontally scrolling shooter with eight levels set underwater. It was released by Rainbow Arts in 1990 for the Amiga. Before starting the game and between levels, the player visits a shop and uses their game score to purchase new submarines and equipment. The submarines come in four different variants, and additional purchases act as additional \"lives\". Each can be equipped with a one-way, two-way or three-way fire weapon of increasing power (and thus cost). Secondary weapons include sonic waves, power-shots and target-seeking missiles. The player can also purchase auxiliary satellites and specify their movement pattern, which can be circular orbits, vertical and horizontal movements, or an intercepting action.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Rainbow Arts", "publishers": "Rainbow Arts", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.38", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Out_%28video_game%29", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/20062-x-out\n"}
