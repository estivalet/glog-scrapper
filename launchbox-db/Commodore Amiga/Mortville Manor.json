{"altername_name": ["Le Manoir de Mortvielle", "Der Landsitz von Mortville", "Manoir de Mortvielle, Le"], "name": "Mortville Manor", "overview": "Mortville Manor is an adventure game which takes place in 1951. Someone is murdered in an impressive manor, and it's up to Jerome Lange to solve the case. But beware: something otherworldly is going on here... The gameplay focuses on conducting a detective investigation rather than on inventory-based puzzles, though items must be found and examined for its purposes. Conversations with suspects offer a wide variety of topics. The player wanders through the mansion at his own pace, but events would sometimes occur regardless of his actions. The game's interface consists of a drop-down menu with about two dozen different verbs used for interaction.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Lankhor", "publishers": "Lankhor", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.21", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortville_Manor", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/41180-mortville-manor\n"}
