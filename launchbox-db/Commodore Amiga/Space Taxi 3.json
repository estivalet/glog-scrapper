{"altername_name": [], "name": "Space Taxi 3", "overview": "Described as a gymnasium party vs game, this version of Space Taxi has a lot of little tricks, like landing on top of each other and pushing each other into walls. The programmers made it very simple to replace the music, so you can have your own version of Space Taxi with your own music. There are a lot of levels including a black hole level, a level in which the controls are reversed in certain regions, a level where your thrusters stop functioning in certain places, a level where a bubble follows you until you land, levels with switches and moving elevator platforms, a level that is completely dark until you see a lightning flash that illuminates the platforms, a level with the bullets from jump man that shoot at you, and tons more!", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Andreas Spreen", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U84qUu9Y_K0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164953-space-taxi-3\n"}
