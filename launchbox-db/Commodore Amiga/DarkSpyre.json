DarkSpyre a top-down \"dungeon-crawling\" role-playing game. The player creates the protagonist, choosing gender and magic specialization (healing or offensive), as well as customizing his/her combat parameters. The game consists of navigating the tower's complex levels (39 of them must be traversed to complete the game, though there are 50 altogether), fighting monsters in action-based combat. The protagonist can equip a variety of weapons and armor; weapons can break after excessive usage, and armor will deteriorate in quality if worn for a long time. Spells are learned from scrolls found in the tower. The hero gains weapon and magic proficiency by repeatedly using the same weapon and/or spell.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Event Horizon Software", "publishers": "Electronic Zoo", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DarkSpyre", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75728-darkspyre\n"}
