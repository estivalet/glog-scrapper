{"altername_name": [], "name": "Fraction Action", "overview": "The action takes place in the basement of the Mad Professor's Mansion, where his motley crew is holding you captive. These creatures hold the keys to the electrified gates blocking your way to freedom. Only after answering Fraction problems correctly will the gatekeepers unlock the gates and permit you to pass. But you'd better move fast!! Incorrect answers are given full screen explanations and an occasional drop down the basement's chutes by the mansion's ghastly ghost. For one or two players, multi-screen arcade action --- ADDITION, SUBTRACTION, MULTIPLICATION, DIVISION or a VARIETY of problems on three difficulty levels. Never before have Fractions been so fun.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Unicorn Software", "publishers": "Unicorn Software", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151420-fraction-action\n"}
