{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cropky", "overview": "Cropky is an Amiga version of Dots - an abstract strategy game played by two people on a sheet of squared paper. The rules are a bit different from original Dots game - your aim is not to capture enemy dots but to link two dots together with a line drawn in any direction you want as long as you don't cross already existing lines or you have where to draw another line (the dot is visible not farther than one square distance - vertically, horizontally or diagonally). Cropky is a conversion of a game under the same title from Atari XL/XE. The original idea comes from Krzysztof \"Kaz\" Ziembik who was persuaded to give permission to create Amiga version by Mariusz \"Ramos\" Rozwadowski. With the abilities and knowledge of Adam Stach (programmer), Piotr \"Piesiu\" Radecki (graphics) and Piotr \"Pece\" Cie\u015blik (music) they created a neat and not so easy game.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2013", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "C&A Fan", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQcQvgQ-0W0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161764-cropky\n"}
