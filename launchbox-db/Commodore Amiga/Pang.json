{"altername_name": ["Buster Bros."], "name": "Pang", "overview": "The initial concept for the game was developed way back in 1983 by the Japanese producers Hudson Soft for the Atari MSX system, under the name Cannon Ball - which was later ported to the ZX Spectrum machine; and later renamed 'Bubble Buster'. Six years thereafter, the Tokyo based software developer Mitchell Corporation began to update the concept for their next generation arcade machines under the name of Pomping World. Released through arcade giants Capcom and Taito, Pomping World received a very warm welcome in Japan, and the arcade rom was then exported around the world. In the U.S, the game was renamed as Buster Bros; while in the UK, the title was changed (yet again) to Pang.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "January 1, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ocean France", "publishers": "Ocean Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.33", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pang_(video_game)", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDKNaYQTA30", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/24050-pang\n"}
