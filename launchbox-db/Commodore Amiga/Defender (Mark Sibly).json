When all 10 humanoids are lost, you must face the hazardous environment of hyperspace! Humanoids are replenished every 5 waves. Pods release deadly swarmers when destroyed. Bombers release mines which must be avoided. Briters appear if you take too long to complete an attack wave.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mark Sibly", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsO1Kc29e4w", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/163760-defender-mark-sibly\n"}
