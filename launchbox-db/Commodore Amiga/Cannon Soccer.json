{"altername_name": ["Cannon Fodder: Amiga Format Christmas Special"], "name": "Cannon Soccer", "overview": "Released in the Amiga Format cover disk 54b. Sensible Software nailed it with a stroke of pure genius. Our favorite war shooter combined with arguably the best football (or soccer for our Amerian friends) game ever made. This \u201cdemo\u201d was a Christmas cover disk on the 1994 copy of Amiga Format magazine. It featured just two levels, \u201cLand of Hope and Glory\u201d, and \u201cIt\u2019s Snow Time\u201d. The game is essentially two extra levels for Cannon Fodder and did not get released as a title in its own right. Both of the levels are little more tricky than I remember the original title \u2013 mainly due to that ****ing helicopter.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sensible Software", "publishers": "Amiga Format", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdrzrdASh3g", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/85324-cannon-soccer\n"}
