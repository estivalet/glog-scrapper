{"altername_name": [], "name": "Spaceship X325L", "overview": "A game preview\\demo created by Stefan Krake and released as freeware in 1993. In a distant future... On Quasidalla i, the entire economy is in danger of collapsing because some very rare chips are found on a circuit board of the central bank's central computer. SPACESHIP 3254, which was supposed to deliver the replacement chips from Gerrod Vt to Quasidalla II, disappeared in hyperspace on the way, but fortunately it reappeared near Quasidalla Ill after some time. Unfortunately, a lot of more or less unpleasant life and machine forms had settled in the ship in hyperspace and caused quite a chaos. You own Quasidalla II's only stellar recovery operation, and you're tasked with recovering the missing chips from the spaceship. Unfortunately, you couldn't pay the lease payments for your super-modern equipment, so all you had left were some outdated H-recovery robots. Try to survive the antics of gallant life and machine forms and save the chips. All the hope of the planet rests on you.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Stefan Krake", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNbFySDyzY4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/370922-spaceship-x325l\n"}
