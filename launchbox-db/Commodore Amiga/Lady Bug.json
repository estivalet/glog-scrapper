{"altername_name": [], "name": "Lady Bug", "overview": "A game similar to that of Pacman, collect items to complete the level but watch the bad guys. It is based on the Arcade Ladybug game and features the same gameplay of dot-eating, revolving doors, a cage letting out monsters and a smart bomb to kill them. It supports one or two plaers and a high score table. It was created by Erwin Van Den Berg, as a public domain game and has some nice 80's synth music you may recognize as New Order by Blue Monday.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Erwin Van Den Berg", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRP22YTX3eE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/372177-lady-bug\n"}
