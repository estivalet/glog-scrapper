{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gobblers", "overview": "Gobblers is a puzzle game written in AMOS where your goal is to get the gobbler to get the bone. Gobbler walks randomly around the screen. When you move, the tiles get removed behind you. By narrowing down the moving space for the gobbler the game becomes increasingly more difficult because if the Gobbler touches you, it's game over. When he gets the bone, it's on to the next level. Late levels add objects like humans to the field that you need to protect from the Gobbler. The game was published as Shareware by Mollysoft Europe in 1992.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ian Williams", "publishers": "Mollysoft Europe", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147330-gobblers\n"}
