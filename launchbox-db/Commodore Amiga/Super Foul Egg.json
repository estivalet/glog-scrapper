{"altername_name": [], "name": "Super Foul Egg", "overview": "1995 saw the release of Super Foul Egg on the Amiga systems, a variant of Puyo Puyo, created by Impact Productions and published by Amiga Power on a Coverdisk for free. Super Foul Egg is written in AMOS and in fact, it is very close to Puyo Puyo, with the same muddy frame for the playfield, the same blobs with eyes that must be paired together in groups of four or more. There even is a small animated character in the middle of the screen which looks just like the Carbuncle mascot of the original. The jamapuyo blocks dropping down on the opponent when you make a combo are also present and these are the so-called foul eggs. The game opens with a well-endowed options screen, where you can select the number of colours of the blobs, speed, if the game should start with filled lines at the bottom and how many wins are required to win the game. You can play against a friend or the computer, or just practice against yourself. The CPU's intelligence can be set to your liking.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Impact Productions", "publishers": "Amiga Power", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Foul_Egg", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xVZMuF_Y8U", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73266-super-foul-egg\n"}
