{"altername_name": [], "name": "FireTeam 2200", "overview": "Fireteam 2200 is a tactical wargame set in the 23rd century. You take the role of the leader of a taskforce (or \"Fireteam\") tasked with undergoing a series of missions. As with most war games you get to assemble your crew and select your scenario, while the action itself takes place in a top-down map from which you view your deployed units and issue orders such as movement commands, weapon assignations and, of course, who to fire at. You can build a squadron of up to 16 units starting with a base budget that allows you to choose from 30 different combat units and 25 different weapon types. Features modem head-to-head multiplayer gameplay for up to two players across platforms (meaning an Amiga player can show a DOS player how it's done).", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "SimSystems", "publishers": "Internecine", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireteam_2200", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/91340-fireteam-2200\n"}
