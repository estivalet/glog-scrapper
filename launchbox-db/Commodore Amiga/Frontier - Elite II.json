{"altername_name": [], "name": "Frontier: Elite II", "overview": "Frontier: Elite 2 is, of course, the sequel to Elite and it continues in much the same way. You have a ship and limited funds, and nowhere to go but out into space. Trade, fight, hunt criminals, work for the various governments, anything goes in Frontier. There are few, if any, limits on what you can do or where you can go. And Frontier's universe (with approx. 100,000,000,000 planets and moons) is so big you'll never see the end of it.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "David Braben", "publishers": "GameTek", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.38", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontier:_Elite_II", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaSnKWUgRfg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/9815-frontier-elite-ii\n"}
