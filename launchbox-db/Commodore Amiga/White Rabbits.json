{"altername_name": [], "name": "White Rabbits", "overview": "This is a brain-taxing and fun little platform puzzler from Andrew Campbell of Black Dragon Design with music by Mike Richmond. Guide the little lupin to the exit on each level by moving blocks around, at least the ones that move the way you want them to! They often won't stop until something stops them. Three difficulties and a password system for easier replays.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Black Dragon Design", "publishers": "5th Dimension", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161721-white-rabbits\n"}
