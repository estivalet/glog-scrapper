{"altername_name": [], "name": "Turbo", "overview": "Turbo is a traditional top-view scroller, much in the spirit of Spy Hunter. It can be played against the clock, which is enormous but short-duration fun, against another player, which is enormously enormous fun, or over a comms link, which is critically unreliable according the publishers. The excuse for a scenario is set in the uncomfortably near future. For no adequately explained reason, the populace have decided that commuting is dull and every other vehicle and pedestrian is fair game. Some unknown character has strewn the road with bolt-on goodies, all designed to get yourself noticed. Missiles and grenades fire forwards, the only differences being speed and range. Oil causes anything behind you to lose control, while hub spikes knock out the competition at the sides. Closet kamikazes are also catered for with the turbo wheels, which allow extreme speed at the expense of any control whatsoever. The graphics work, the sound is suitably grotesque and the whole thing is presented with the panache of a dead stoat. But it is such manic fun to play that that all goes out of the window. If I had to describe Turbo as glibly as possible, I would go about it this: Audio-Visual Jadedness is the disease, Turbo is the cure.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Silent Software", "publishers": "MicroIllusions", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mkduUO3xZ8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73709-turbo\n"}
