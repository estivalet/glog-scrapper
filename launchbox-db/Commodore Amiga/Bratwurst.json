{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bratwurst", "overview": "A multi-scrolling shooter created by Three Little Elks and released to PD\\Freeware in 1995. Bratwurst is the same kind of game as Gravity Force and Roketz. The difference is that it uses vector graphics instead of ordinary bitmap graphics. This enables the map and players to be scaled easily which means that when the players are close to each other the camera will zoom in on the players to get a more detailed view. Another difference with Bratwurst is that four players can play simultaneously.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Three Little Elks", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/368429-bratwurst\n"}
