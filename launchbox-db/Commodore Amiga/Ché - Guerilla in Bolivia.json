{"altername_name": ["Guerilla in Bolivia"], "name": "Ch\u00e9: Guerilla in Bolivia", "overview": "This is a turn-based strategy game set during the Bolivian civil war in 1966/67. The player takes the role of Ch\u00e9 Guevara, best known for his role during the Cuban revolution, with the goal to conquer the city La Paz. The game is mostly menu based (with some digitised pictures thrown in) where the player commands the 15 revolutionaries. The available options are resting, moving through Bolivia, consulting maps to get an idea where to go, training to increase the statistics of the troops, defending (helps the odds when government troops attack) or sending out scouts. Most important is the food supply which can be either obtained by buying it (when in a village) or hunting (the success depends on the region). If it gets scarce, the player can ration it - but this has negative effect on the combat performance. Ambushes are either calculated automatically or, if it is lead by Guevara, plays out as a first-person action sequence. Here the player moves a crosshair over the screen and shoots popping out enemies.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Cases Computer Simulations", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/93624-che-guerilla-in-bolivia\n"}
