{"altername_name": [], "name": "Interstate 2", "overview": "An updated version of the Amiga conversion of Mille Bornes. The original came out in 1991 and this version had updates in 1995 and 1998. Try to get 1000 miles before your opponent. There are a set of hazard cards, which not only take your opponent off the road but give them something they have to specifically fix: for example, if the the \"Nail in Tire\" card is played on you, you need to play the \"Spare Tire\" card before you can progress. There are also safety cards, that make you immune from a certain kind of hazard. For example, playing the \"Steel Tire\" card means it is impossible for your opponent to play a \"Nail in Tire\" card. There is only one of each kind of safety card in the deck. You can play a safety card at any time, but if you play it while you are afflicted by the corresponding hazard card, you get a special point bonus. Finally, there are wild cards, which can be played as if they were any other kind of card.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Louis Allen", "publishers": "American Dream Software", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164052-interstate-2\n"}
