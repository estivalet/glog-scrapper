{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ultimate Domination", "overview": "Ultimate Domination is a very polished and interesting strategy game taking some inspiration from the Amiga Game Domination itself and looking a bit to me like K240. After leaving the Earth and arriving at the new solar system we have discovered that the planet that was originally chosen as our new home is insufficient for the growing population, we have but one possibility.... seize control and populate every planet within the system. It is up to you to decide on a plan of action, although we suggest that science and pollution should be at the top of the list. We DO NOT want a repeat of the Earth situation. In the demo game you have only 50 cycles to make a difference, the full version removes that timeout and adds 3 disks worth of additional data to the game.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Alternative Realities", "publishers": "Alternative Realities", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEgDTGYc4rc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162216-ultimate-domination\n"}
