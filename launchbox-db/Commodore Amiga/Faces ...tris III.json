{"altername_name": [], "name": "Faces ...tris III", "overview": "Faces ...Tris III is a Puzzle game, developed by Sphere, Inc and published by Spectrum Holobyte, which was released in Europe in 1991. Enough already. Tetris was a killer. Welltris was moderately amusing. Faces is a bore. If it had been the first of the series, I probably would have felt much different about it, but if I want to play a Tetris game, I\u2019ll play Tetris. This variation drops pairs of pieces of faces (I suppose that\u2019s how they came up with the catchy name) from the top of the screen and you have to maneuver them to fit together. It\u2019s all slickly done, with good graphics and fun music, but the slickness can\u2019t hide the fact that it\u2019s more marketing than game.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sphere", "publishers": "Spectrum Holobyte", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "10", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faces...tris_III", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XBaAvYtp8U", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/65788-faces-tris-iii\n"}
