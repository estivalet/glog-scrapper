{"altername_name": [], "name": "Breach", "overview": "Breach is not exactly a new product, having surfaced on the Amiga through the American company Omnitrend in 1987. The game is based around tactical-level ground combat of the future, space marines serving as the backbone force in nine conflicts. As in Laser Squad each unit has a finite set of movement points per turn depleted by firing weapons, moving across rougher terrain etc. This system of command allows units to perform multiple tasks within a 'turn'. Unfortunately the effects of such actions are purely short term only, no long term strategic thought can be allowed for, the inflexibility of it all preventing the player from performing more complex actions. The conflicts provide some variety to the proceedings, increasing in difficulty very quickly from the first few 'seek and destroy' and rescue missions to near suicide combo-missions. The hardest mission of all involves a single Squad Marine entering the heart of an enemy fortress to rescue an Admiral. A Scenario Builder is also included on the disk. A good beginners' game with the challenge to match but too simple in scope and ideas to provide a long term challenge.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Omnitrend Software", "publishers": "Artronic Products", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73850-breach\n"}
