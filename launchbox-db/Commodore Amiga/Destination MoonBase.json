{"altername_name": [], "name": "Destination MoonBase", "overview": "Destination Moonbase is a single player, keyboard controlled Lander variant In this game the player must successfully land on one of the three moonbase landing pads within the time limit. The game has three levels of difficulty and the time, rate of decent and number of craft varies as the game's difficulty increases. There are two screens to the game. The first screen sees the lander positioned below the orbiting space station, from here the lander must be rotated before the engines are fired otherwise it will shoot upwards into the space station which will destroy it. On this screen if the lander goes beyond the right/left border it will reappear on the other side. The second screen sees the lander approach the lunar surface, here if the craft approaches the right/left border the background scrolls beneath it.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jimbo Barber", "publishers": "Software 2000", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRmotbvvQMM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162483-destination-moonbase\n"}
