The possibility of playing in pairs, in challenge mode, that is to say opposed to each other, thereby offering a kind of \"combat\" mode where opponents enjoy bumping into bumper cars, to poke the ball,\u2026 Have a playing area larger than the screen (follow the trajectory of the ball, but don't worry, despite the disappearance of the puck from the screen, an indication still shows its position) Have with particular type of puck configuration: puck free in its movements, cloned symmetrically, cloned on the upper level,\u2026 (particularly interesting for levels several screens high) Plus a few more flourishes, like a background pattern, a snow effect, a \"blind\" game (the bricks are there, but invisible, I know it's weird, but so are the convolutions of a Nerdy brain, so, logically\u2026) And certainly lots of other stuff that I must have forgotten to mention and that I let you discover in the (amiga) guides and other documentation.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ringard", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161537-ocb\n"}
