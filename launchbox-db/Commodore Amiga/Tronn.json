{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tronn", "overview": "This is a clone of a game known to all, it's Tron. This version was produced by a old hacker of the Amiga: Thierry Floquet. The game is simple: you're a pixel (if not a motorcycle) and you draw a line behind you in an arena. And It is thus necessary to \"dual\" longer than the opponent(s) in this arena to win. If you succeed, you pass at the next level. The difficulty is getting going on and we are rapidly in very arduous levels and with several enemies in the arena and full of obstacles. Tronn remains very (perhaps too) classical, for example, music is missing during the game or multiplayer mode. But it can be a ton of fun to outsmart and outmaneuver the computer. Released as freeware by Thierry Floquet in 1998.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1998", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Thierry Floquet", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164730-tronn\n"}
