{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bombmania", "overview": "Bombmania is a Bomberman variant. The player, without a specific background story, has to solve 80 levels which are divided between four scenarios. The basic principle: there are many enemies in the levels which should be killed by using the unlimited amount of bombs. Every time a bomb is placed on the ground, the player has a few moments to get out of range to avoid being killed by the blast, which evolves horizontally and vertically from the bomb point. The basic range of a bomb is one field. Besides the enemies, most level obstacles can also be bombed away. However, there are various power-ups which slightly change the gameplay when picked up, e.g. greater speed, bombs with a higher range, mines (explode when someone walks over it), or remote controlled bombs. The scenarios differ in environments and enemies, e.g. the labyrinth scenario has turtles which require multiple hits or the desert has droids which replicate over time. Each level has a time limit and the two-player duels can be either played turn-based or simultaneously.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "MegArts", "publishers": "M-Soft Software Design", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75361-bombmania\n"}
