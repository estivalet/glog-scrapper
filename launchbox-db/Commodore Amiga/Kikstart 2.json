{"altername_name": ["Kikstart II", "Kikstart 2"], "name": "Kikstart 2", "overview": "Based around the Kikstart TV show, the game allows you to recreate all those death-defying stunts in the comparative safety of your home. Viewed from the side, there are many hazards to avoid along the way. Some of these include steps to jump over, tyres and hedges to plough through at maximum speed, and mud which will slow you down. Players can either play against their opponent in a straight-out race to the finish post, or they can \"win\" by aggregated finishing times. Courses are played in sets of five, denoted by a letter of the alphabet and can be edited by the player using the built-in course designer. This allowed the user to place any obstacles on a blank track and later save and share completed courses.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Icon Design", "publishers": "Mastertronic", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.64", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kikstart_2", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/74313-kikstart-2\n"}
