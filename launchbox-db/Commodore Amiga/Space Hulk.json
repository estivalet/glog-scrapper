{"altername_name": [], "name": "Space Hulk", "overview": "Space Hulk is a real-time conversion of the original board game by Games Workshop set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe. Players control a squad of Space Marines in an maze allowing 90 degree turns which they may view through multiple first person cameras or using an overhead map. Their mission: to wipe out the Genestealers, a vicious alien race inhabiting the derelict ships. The 5-man squad (sometimes accompanied by another), encased in Terminator armors and armed with long range and melee weapons, can be given tactical orders (executed simultaneously) via map - with an option to temporarily freeze time (to give player more room for thinking). The game features 51 missions, including tutorial and original Deathwing campaign. The CD-ROM re-release adds extra 9 missions and more digitized speech (in slightly better quality).", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Electronic Arts", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Hulk_(1993_video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/45285-space-hulk\n"}
