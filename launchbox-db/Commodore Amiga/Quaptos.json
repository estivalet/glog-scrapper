{"altername_name": [], "name": "Quaptos", "overview": "Quaptos is a timed puzzle board game. The goal of the game is to arrange an identical pattern in the second window within five minutes. Solving the task allows uncovering one part of prize picture. The screen is divided into three parts. Part one shows the information (points, remaining time, level code). Bottom window shows a pattern, which must be repeated in the upper window. Every square brick has a digit on it - initially \"one\". Each placed next to it brick increases the number by one point. After reaching the number \"four\" the brick number returns to \"one\". The bricks may be deleted at any time - in the reverse order of their placement on the board (last brick disappears first). After each completed board the player receives a level code. The game allows to choose one of three available backgrounds.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Pawe\u0142 Gonet", "publishers": "Twin Spark Soft", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzPM-wAl9sM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162818-quaptos\n"}
