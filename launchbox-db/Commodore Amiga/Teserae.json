{"altername_name": [], "name": "Teserae", "overview": "Teserae was first created on the Atari ST by The Albanian Sausage Corporation - a sort of game and a demo with great music and whizzy scrolling backgrounds. I remade a version for the Amiga in the early 1990's to help learn some of the machines features. Guide the Tetris shapes to form neat lines with no gaps.
