{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tank Wars", "overview": "Inspired by the classic Tankz, this Blitz Basic game pits up to five human players in a battle tank-on-tank. The playfields are outfitted with some obstacles reminiscent to those used in a \"snake\" style game, offering protection from enemy fire. Bonuses pop up from time to time, though these bonuses may either increase or decrease your energy and firepower. As a result, apart from the usual \"bomb your opponent to bits\" method, one tactic in this game is to chase your opponent into harmful bonuses. The game can be played in single matches or tournament style, where you may save your scores between rounds in order to resume later on.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2006", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Alternate Realities", "publishers": "Walternate Realities", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "5", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e93AZJXesX4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164691-tank-wars\n"}
