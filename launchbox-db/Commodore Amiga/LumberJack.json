{"altername_name": [], "name": "LumberJack", "overview": "You're a lumberjack and you're way more than just OK! You're so amazing that you cut out chunks as you chop them, but as there are branches on both sides you always need to hit the tree from the correct side and avoid the branches, too much beer and switching sides completely by avoiding silky smooth ladies undies that might distract you from Lumberjacking and seduce you into LumberJilling.
