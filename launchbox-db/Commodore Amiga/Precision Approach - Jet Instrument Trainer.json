{"altername_name": ["Precision Approach"], "name": "Precision Approach: Jet Instrument Trainer", "overview": "Game concept & design by Bryan Styer and pilot Capt. Earl Rogers. Coding by Steve Michel. PRECISION APPROACH: JET INSTRUMENT TRAINER was intended to be a simulation tool rather than a game that allowed commercial pilots to develop/maintain proficiency in flying aeroplanes. Additionally, it allowed pilots experienced in other aircraft to become familiar with Boeing 727 operating techniques, which form the basis of the flight simulator. PRECISION APPROACH was exclusively made for the Amiga and originally released in 1989. Enhanced 512K and 1MB versions followed in 1990. The 1MB version was only made available to customers upon request, who were required to send in their original disk with a self-addressed stamped envelope to the publisher.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Precision Approach", "publishers": "Precision Approach", "genres": "Flight Simulator", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165140-precision-approach-jet-instrument-trainer\n"}
