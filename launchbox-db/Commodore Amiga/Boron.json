{"altername_name": [], "name": "Boron", "overview": "Probably best known as the precursor to the genuinely loved sequel Boron II, this game is difficult because you are dead with a single hit. Just as in real life you get one shot at it. It is a shooter, but offers some challenging navigation elements as well, plus a pretty intimidating boss. It is unfortunately the first and final boss rolled into one. It's a short game which can likely be played in less than 2 minutes by someone who knows the foes and challenges of it.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Paul Mangan", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=2b74aEqr0bg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162413-boron\n"}
