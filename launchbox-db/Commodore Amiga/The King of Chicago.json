{"altername_name": [], "name": "The King of Chicago", "overview": "The King of Chicago is a 1986 action adventure strategy computer game by Doug Sharp. Based on numerous Hollywood mobster movies, this game is set in the 1930s. With Al Capone out of the picture, Chicago's prohibition-era profit is up for grabs. Are you merciless and cunning enough to gain it by whatever means are required? Every action you take has complex long-term consequences which are not always obvious at the time. You must keep your people on your side, watching what you say and do, knowing that an overthrow could be hatched at any moment. Look after your woman as well - who's going to respect a single mobster? The money has to be juggled in these ways, not forgetting to reach an 'understanding' with the Mayor to avoid any negative attentions.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Cinemaware", "publishers": "Cinemaware", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.38", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_King_of_Chicago", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17xQQ-PMPBs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/30388-the-king-of-chicago\n"}
