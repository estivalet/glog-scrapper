{"altername_name": ["Humans 3: Evolution: Lost in Time"], "name": "Humans III: Evolution: Lost in Time...", "overview": "Zoo keepers from an alien world have scoured human history to steal 7 important figures from different epochs, and it is your job to rescue them. First you will have to explore four worlds to find the 6 pieces of their Time Machine, avoiding the chasing aliens. Unlike Humans 2, this is a full sequel to the game known as Evolution: Dino Dudes on some systems with a new game engine, rather than merely a data disk with new levels. As before the gameplay is influenced by Lemmings. Each of your characters have their own abilities, including fire-creation, grabbing and smashing, which must be used in conjunction to beat the puzzles before you. Passwords are offered for each level.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Imagitec Design", "publishers": "GameTek", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Humans_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73390-humans-iii-evolution-lost-in-time\n"}
