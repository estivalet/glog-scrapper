{"altername_name": [], "name": "Fiendish Freddy's Big Top O' Fun", "overview": "The Big Top O' Fun circus is in deep trouble: due tonight is the payment of a $10.000 loan to the Big Greedy Bank. The evening's performance must bring in that money or the circus will be seized. The bank does not play fair, though: they send the evil clown Fiendish Freddy to sabotage the acts. The performance consists of six different events. There is a practice mode for single events, and up to five players can compete in the full game, but must reach the $10.000 on their own, not together. The money is awarded by a jury after each act. In this game, you try to save your circus from Fiendish Freddy buying it out by preforming 6 circus acts which include... High Diving, Juggling, Trapeze, Knife Throw, Tightrope, and Cannonball These games are rather tricky, and watch out for Fiendish Freddy who has a fiendish trick up his sleeve every time.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gray Matter", "publishers": "Mindscape", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40789-fiendish-freddys-big-top-o-fun\n"}
