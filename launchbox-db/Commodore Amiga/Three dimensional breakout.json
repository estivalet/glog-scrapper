{"altername_name": ["3D Breakout"], "name": "Three dimensional breakout", "overview": "A game from Wicked Software's 50 Great Games release in 1990. A 3D game that really takes the name to heart as it can be used with Red/Blue 3D glasses! Bounce the ball off paddle to hit as many tiles as possible with the 5 balls/lives you've been given. Use the Amiga mouse to move the paddle around the floor. Use the left mouse to launch any new balls. But don't click the left button during the game or it will end your turn. Later, in 2018 this was released to public domain.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tim Kemp", "publishers": "Wicked Software", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQh8jpGCC2c", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/371422-three-dimensional-breakout\n"}
