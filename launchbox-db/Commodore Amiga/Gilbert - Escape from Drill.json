{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gilbert: Escape from Drill", "overview": "Gilbert: Escape From Drill is an action game, developed by Enigma Variations Ltd and published by Again Again, which was released in Europe in 1989. \u2018Oh dear\u2019 was my first thought. \u2018What on Drill has happened to Gilbert?\u2019 was my second. Not only do we see his snotty feet for the first time in the game, but we now see him in the swim \u2013 Gilbert swimming? Come off it! Gilbert doesn\u2019t get off to a good start with a dodgy but green sprite wandering around a repetitively similar maze city. The very simple sub-games are fun for the first few minutes with the Snot fight being about the best (although this doesn\u2019t say much for the others). One for avid mappers but not one for seekers of startlingly original gameplay. Controlling Gilbert, you traverse the many pathways and buildings scattered around Drill, avoiding such hazards as frogs, Galaxians, WWII biplanes and other such \u2018horrors\u2019, or putting your high-powered nostrils into action and snotting them!", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Enigma Variations", "publishers": "Again Again", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZBZ3FGw-EE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/68297-gilbert-escape-from-drill\n"}
