{"altername_name": [], "name": "Advanced Fruit Machine Simulator", "overview": "It's not a mega thrilling 3D shooter, but it does what it says on the box! This game was released on nearly every popular computer at the time, but it's good to see that it hasn't lost the fun on the port to the Amiga. It is a game for 1 - 4 players. Each player is given \u00a31.50 stake money which is represented as a series of coins. These coins are fed into the machine by pressing the appropriate action key, zero feeds in \u00a31 for example. Once the machine has been fed all the player has to do is spin the reels and see what happens. When a winning combination appears the game offers the chance to gamble it for a higher or lower win. Rather than getting a gambling addiction and hanging with crackheads and the like, have a go at this game - It's fun, fun, fun all the way and you won't have the debt collectors chasing you!", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "The Codemasters Software Company Limited", "publishers": "The Codemasters Software Company Limited", "genres": "Casino", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/74094-advanced-fruit-machine-simulator\n"}
