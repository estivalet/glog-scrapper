{"altername_name": [], "name": "Amoeba Invaders", "overview": "Amoeba Invaders is a single player, keyboard or joystick controlled, Space Invaders clone. Gameplay is pretty much the same as all other games of this type, the player has a cannon which can move left and right. It hides behind four houses that are gradually reduced to rubble before being completely destroyed by a screen full of descending alien ships. Every so-often a mother ship flies across of the screen. During the game an extra base is awarded when the score exceeds 1500 points, but there is only one extra base per game. One feature this game has which many games do not is that the player can choose map their own keys to the Left/Right/Fire and Pause actions. When a game is over the high score for the gaming session is updated but it is not saved for later and the player is not prompted for their name/initials.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "", "developers": "LateNight Developments Corporation", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/159191-amoeba-invaders\n"}
