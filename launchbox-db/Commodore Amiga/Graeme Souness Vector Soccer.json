{"altername_name": [], "name": "Graeme Souness Vector Soccer", "overview": "The most important feature of Graeme Souness: Vector Soccer are the three-dimensional vector graphics. To accompany this, the camera perspectives are relatively near to the playfield; a small overlay of the whole field which is shown in the right corner is required to get an overview. The rest of the game offers no surprises: the player takes the role of a soccer team, either during a friendly match or a tournament, and tries to win. The athletes are directly controlled and are able to perform actions like shooting or passing. There are various match settings available, e.g. difficulty level or match length. In multiplayer mode, either two players play against each other or up to eight players are responsible for one team each during a tournament.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Impulze", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "8", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/94278-graeme-souness-vector-soccer\n"}
