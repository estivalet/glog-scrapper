{"altername_name": [], "name": "Napoleonics", "overview": "Napoleonics is a compilation of three Dr. Turcan's strategy games: Waterloo, Borodino & Austerlitz. The presentation and interface is identical in all of them: you are observing the battle area through a 3D perspective, while issuing commands by typing in certain pre-defined text elements (combined with names of commanders, places and time of execution). You may play both sides. It is also possible to play a two player game, or to take neither side (watching the computer playing both sides).", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Turcan Research Systems Limited", "publishers": "CCS", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147287-napoleonics\n"}
