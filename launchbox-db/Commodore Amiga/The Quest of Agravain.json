{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Quest of Agravain", "overview": "A long time ago, Lord Agravain roamed the land of Riva in his quest for the Elixir of Youth, the only hope for the all the ageing knights. The Quest of Agravain is a platform game where the player controls a medieval knight armed with a sword. The main objective is to reach the exit door at the top of each level. Pressing the fire button makes Lord Agravain thrust his sword forward. Pressing fire while holding down makes him throw a weapon (the default one is a small lance). Like in Ghosts 'N Goblins, when the knight is hit he loses his armor. If he is attacked while semi-nude, he dies. There are several power-ups scattered throughout the 4 sets of levels (a cross paralyzes the enemies, a star gives invulnerability, etc). The game starts with three lives and has no form of saving progress.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Codemasters", "publishers": "Codemasters", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/92271-the-quest-of-agravain\n"}
