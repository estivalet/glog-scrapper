{"altername_name": [], "name": "Battle Cars", "overview": "Battle Cars is a one or two player game played inside an arena, with each player being equipped with an armour plated car and a big gun (an M61 20mm cannon). You start off with 4000 rounds of ammunition which lasts for about 40 seconds of continuous firing, but is more than adequate for the task in hand. The aim of the game is simple - destroy all of the armour on any side of your opponent's car. The cars are armoured on the front, back, left and right; hitting anywhere else on your opponent's car (e.g. the wheels) won't do any damage. There are two buildings in the arena to make driving more fun, although crashing into them (or into the walls) doesn't damage your car. In one player mode, you battle against a computer controlled car. The computer will follow a set course around the arena, and will not fire at you. This might sound a bit too easy until you realise that you only have a limited amount of time in which to destroy the computer car.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "", "developers": "David Jameson", "publishers": "David Jameson", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/74917-battle-cars\n"}
