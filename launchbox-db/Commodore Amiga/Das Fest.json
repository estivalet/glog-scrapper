{"altername_name": [], "name": "Das Fest", "overview": "A German text/image based adventure game. The adventures of a castaway on a deserted isle. You open your eyes and see a bright blue pond in which tiny kayaks are busy making their way. As you try to stand up, you feel every muscle in your body rebel. You remember wanting to travel using a small sailing boat to relax completely before the festival. After a few days on the open sea, bad weather arrived. The tiny ship was tossed. If only there were more crew than you! Now you are stuck here, but that isn't half bad. You'd be thankful if one of these huts had some food. Hopefully you can still make it to the festival!", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Steffen G\u00f6bbels", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/371883-das-fest\n"}
