{"altername_name": [], "name": "Caesar", "overview": "Caesar is a Strategy game, published by Impressions Games, which was released in 1992. It's the first century BC and you get to play the part of an ambitious brown-nosing public figure eager to grease up to Caesar Augustus, the current Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. Your main aim is to run your allotted province as efficiently as possible and thus gain Caesar's favour. In effect, this means building and maintaining the essential infrastructure of the country, such as housing, the water-supply and transport links. Caesar holds its own when compared to other god-type games. The graphics are extremely detailed, even down to little members of the public roaming the streets. The sound effects and music are very atmospheric and the point 'n' click control system is easy to use with little need to consult the manual. Avid god-sim players will find Caesar a welcome addition to their collection. The depth of gameplay and sheer number of possibilities offer a great challenge whilst it is also tremendous fun. New players eager to experience a god-sim for the first time, could well find Caesar to their liking.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Golden Sector Design", "publishers": "Impressions Games", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.17", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/63078-caesar\n"}
