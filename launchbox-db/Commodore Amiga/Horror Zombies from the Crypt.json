{"altername_name": [], "name": "Horror Zombies from the Crypt", "overview": "Why do they bother? Companies trying to do \u2018scary\u2019 horror games. I mean They sure as hell don\u2019t scare anybody and nine times out of ten they\u2019re decidedly mediocre anyway. This is certainly true of the awesomely below-average Horror Zombies from the Crypt, a game that supposedly pays homage to the classic horror flicks of yesteryear. In it you play a hapless hero who stumbles into a creepy mansion in the dead of night (oh yes, because that sort of thing happens all the time) and then has to try and escape. Naturally this unlikely scenario manifests itself into a scrolling arcade adventure with the baddies all extras from various generic cinematic shockers. You\u2019ve got zombies, vampires, frankensteins stumbling about after you\u2026 it\u2019s all quite predictable really. The basic object is to avoid these meanies (or, better yet, kill them with your throwing knives), explore the various levels, collect keys and objects, unlock doors... you know the sort of thing. There are some vague platform elements - many items of furniture can be climbed and jumped on, and in some cases moved about. If anything, Horror Zombies is best compared to something like The Addams Family - although this can\u2019t dare to hold a candle to Ocean\u2019s classic platformer. Here the action is stunted, slow and unexciting. There\u2019s very little to hold your attention, and the rather gratuitous death sequence (your head blows up unconvincingly), little effort has gone into trying to make the game anything like the horror movies it\u2019s supposed to be a tribute to. It\u2019s not totally unplayable, but it lacks imagination, hasn\u2019t been very well put together and as a result comes across as one of the most mediocre games we\u2019ve seen in a good few months.
