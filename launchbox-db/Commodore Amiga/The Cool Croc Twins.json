{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Cool Croc Twins", "overview": "Cool Croc Twins is a Platform game, developed by Arcade Masters and published by Empire Interactive, which was released in 1992. Cool Croc Twins has been very well presented (you even get a free T-shirt in the box!) and fortunately has been very well written as well. A level return-code facility (which lets you skip all the bits you've done before) and the simultaneous two-player head-to-head mode makes it a game which won't just get put away. Eventually it will lose its appeal because of the lack of variety or different screens. An in-built screen designer would have made it a brilliant package but as it stands, Cool Croc Twins is still very, very good.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Arcade Masters", "publishers": "Empire Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.17", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_Croc_Twins", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/63407-the-cool-croc-twins\n"}
