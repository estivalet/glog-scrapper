{"altername_name": ["Rome: Pathway to Power"], "name": "Rome AD 92: The Pathway to Power!", "overview": "You're a Roman slave. Well actually, your character is. You've never seen anything more than the provincial town you're in. You feel imprisoned, so logically, you will try to escape. That's your first mission, but it's a long way to Rome and in this game, you will see not all paths lead to Rome actually. Escape from that little town before the lava kills you and you will be saved... In the first mission, that is. But actually, there's so much to say about this game, that I can only recommend playing it. Its graphics are very good for its time and the gameplay is pretty okay too. You have a lot of freedom to do whatever you like, but you are bound to some storyline restrictions, which makes this game fun and not too hard to play. So it's definitely a game I would recommend, especially if you like to play freeplay adventure games. Anyway, try it and you will see for yourself.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Firstlight", "publishers": "Millennium Interactive", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome:_Pathway_to_Power", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn8Ng38e-gI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72889-rome-ad-92-the-pathway-to-power\n"}
