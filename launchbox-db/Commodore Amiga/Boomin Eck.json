{"altername_name": ["Boomin' Eck!"], "name": "Boomin Eck", "overview": "A playable action demo created by Mike Carter, Dean and Ola. Far away in a land where Lego is made, a crisis was happening. The machines creating the Lego men were goofing up more than normal. All the reject Lego men had no legs so they had to wobble to move about. Two of these rejects weren't having any more of this and so wobbled to the creators hill in Lego land. Dr. Technic (the creator of Lego) knew what they were here to see him about and so before they could say too much offered them a challenge. \"My mazes are becoming cluttered with loose bricks and are making them very untidy and difficult to wonder round. If you on your own or with a friend can clear them as best you can I will award you with a very special gift. I have one pair of legs left to which I will color and give to the winner. If you fail to get through the mazes then you will be killed. It won't be easy, oh no! I've created a gang of ghosts to wonder the lonely mazes in search of someone to scare...if they find you you'll know!\"", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mike Carter", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/370813-boomin-eck\n"}
