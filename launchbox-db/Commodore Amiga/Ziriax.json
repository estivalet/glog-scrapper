{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ziriax", "overview": "Ziriax is a side-scrolling futuristic \"shoot-'em-up\" set in a futuristic environment, similar to R-Type. The player controls a spaceship-like aircraft that is trying to survive amidst the fire of hostile ships and other enemies. There are five stages in the game altogether; each contains a fight against a boss enemy at the end. Small spheres are dropped by enemies; collecting these spheres bestows the player-controlled ship with various power-ups. These include two additional small ships above and below the main one, an ability to shoot backwards, and missiles that can be shot diagonally.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "The Whiz Kidz", "publishers": "The Software Business", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.8", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/79316-ziriax\n"}
