{"altername_name": [], "name": "Typhoon", "overview": "Typhoon is a vertically scrolling shooter in which the player uses a space ship to kill aliens. The game has about 50 levels in changing environments, e.g. an asteroid belt, a jungle or a futuristic city. Special symbols, available at the beginning of each level, grant an extra life or one of three special upgrades (like a better weapon or a shield). The latter are only temporary. The game features two especially dangerous enemies: indestructible, rotating plates and skulls which grant instant death when shot. The game always shows how many points are missing before getting a better rank in the high score list.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Christoph Sing", "publishers": "Kingsoft", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/110625-typhoon\n"}
