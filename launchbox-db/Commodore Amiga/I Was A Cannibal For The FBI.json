{"altername_name": [], "name": "I Was A Cannibal For The FBI", "overview": "The FBI sends an agent to deal with cannibals on a desert island. I was a Cannibal for the FBI is an open-source freeware text adventure. It has a basic parser without the standard features of the older Infocom one like recognition of chain commands and adverbs. The game's main objective is to escape the island and avoid being eaten by the cannibals. The Amiga version was originally distributed in an appendix for a book about programming (the handbook for the Visionary Interactive Editor, included with the software) by John Olsen, the game's author. One main difference is in the use of the mouse, as objects can only be taken by dragging and dropping them on windows. Objects and places can also be examined by clicking them on the picture and inventory windows. The inventory window at the top-right of the screen holds a maximum of 6 objects. Objects on the room appear either embedded on the location or inside a strip at the right of the picture window. Below the inventory there is a click-able compass and besides it the up and down buttons. Blocked directions have a muted color, while the possible exits have a normal color. Below the compass, there are five buttons: HELP (displays some basic information regarding the interface), DIG (to unearth objects when possible), LOAD (loads the saved game), SAVE (saves the game) and QUIT (exits the game).", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Artesian Software Lab", "publishers": "Aegis Development", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/372134-i-was-a-cannibal-for-the-fbi\n"}
