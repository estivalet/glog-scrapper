{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bulldozer Bob", "overview": "A sliding piece puzzle game created by Simon Dye for Digital Obsession. A level editor could be obtained by sending 50p to the author. Bulldozer Bob extends the basic sliding puzzle game formula by giving you the ability to flip a block from the front of your player sprite to the back, from the left to the right, and vice versa. Each level must be completed within an allowed number of moves. (It is either this or a timer in these games.) In most levels, there are also special tiles that allow movement in only one direction or tiles that break after you moved over them.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Digital Obsession", "publishers": "CLR Licenseware", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQRdA6xUl3I", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164971-bulldozer-bob\n"}
