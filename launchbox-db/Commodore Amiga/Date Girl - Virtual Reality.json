{"altername_name": ["Date Girls Club: Vida X"], "name": "Date Girl: Virtual Reality", "overview": "A very short point and click \"adventure\" game. You attempt to meet and seduce a young red-headed woman named \"Vida\". The graphics in this game are (for the most part) digitized still pictures of an actual model; while sexual in nature, they never rise above the level of softcore. The gameplay is incredibly simplistic, and it can be very hard to make a wrong move- typically, if you make an error, the game just gives a brief quip regarding why a move didn't work, and then returns you to the exact same point to try again.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "MarkSoft", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/93907-date-girl-virtual-reality\n"}
