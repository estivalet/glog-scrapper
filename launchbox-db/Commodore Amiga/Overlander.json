{"altername_name": [], "name": "Overlander", "overview": "It's the end of the world as we know it. What has happened? Global thermonuclear war, another ice age, little green men coming from the planet Zitt? No, it was underarm deodorants! Yes, the CFC gases from smelly aerosols have finally destroyed the ozone layer. So what do you do? Sit in the sun getting skin cancer? No, instead you drive a super-fast car and are paid to transport dodgy goods from city to city. To liven up the journey other motorists try to ram you off the road or just shoot you! It's just as well there's a shopping centre nearby where you can buy essential stuff like turbos, battering rams, flame bombs, and rockets. The undulating road's quite good, but other than that the graphics are bland and badly animated with poor collision detection. Complementing them perfectly, the simple roadblasting gameplay will drive you mad with boredom.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Elite Systems", "publishers": "Elite Systems", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9Nr_eENLbM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72645-overlander\n"}
