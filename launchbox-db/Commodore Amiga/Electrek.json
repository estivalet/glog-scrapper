{"altername_name": ["Electrek: Life Of A Handyman"], "name": "Electrek", "overview": "Guide Ralph around a maze of wires,directing the sparks to turn off the circuits. You have to direct an electric current across each level, by getting to some precariously-placed switches, and alternating their position. There are lots of bad guys trying to stop you (for a not-readily-apparent reason; maybe they\u2019re Green campaigners), and contact with them costs you a life. The game\u2019s most novel feature is one I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ve never seen before \u2013 it\u2019s almost a gameplay interpretation of double buffering (the programming technique in which you have two copies of the screen, and draw graphics to the background one, swapping them once it\u2019s all done, to speed up play and eliminate flicker). There are two sets of platforms, one behind the other, and a simple joystick motion switches you between the two.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Chris Nodder", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmfXzMXaExQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161742-electrek\n"}
