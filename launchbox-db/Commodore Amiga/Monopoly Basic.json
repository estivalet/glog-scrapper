{"altername_name": [], "name": "Monopoly Basic", "overview": "David Addison wrote some excellent games in ABasiC, this one is quite well known for its quality and playability even on 256K machines. The David Addison games originally appeared on Fred Fish disks 15. This is one of the first Amiga Public Domain games ever: It came already out in 1985 when the Amiga was not yet available in Europe. It is really well coded but is a single player only game featuring the classic Monopoly board game. The game was so well loved that Parker Brothers went after David Addison, back when that wasn't very common.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "David Addison", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164290-monopoly-basic\n"}
