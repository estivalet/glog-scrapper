{"altername_name": ["Tie-Break", "Tie-Break", "Adidas Championship Tie-Break"], "name": "Adidas Championship Tie Break", "overview": "This tennis simulation uses a top-down scrolling perspective. You are not in control of the player's motion, but once he gets close to the ball, shot selection is down to you. Standard shots plus topspin, lobs and stop volleys are available, by pushing the joystick in the right direction as you aim the shot. The game supports up to 16 players in singles matches on a variety of court surfaces. It includes all of the major world tournaments - the four Grand Slam events at Melbourne, Roland Garros, Wimbledon and New York, plus the Davis Cup and Masters events. An early attempt at TV-style coverage is offered.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "January 1, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Starbyte Software", "publishers": "Ocean Software", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/23803-adidas-championship-tie-break\n"}
