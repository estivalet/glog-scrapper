{"altername_name": [], "name": "Assassin: Special Edition", "overview": "Assassin's storyline is fairly simple. The character is an assassin that has been hired to kill the antagonist of the game, \"Midan\". He is then dropped behind enemy lines and must first disable Midan's power source, and then assassinate him. The assassin is armed with a boomerang that is razor-edged. There are three skill levels to Assassin, Rookie, Arcade and Ultimate. As well as changing the difficulty, each level unlocks more of the game than the level that is easier than it. The enemies are tougher to defeat in the higher levels, but there are more rewards.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "March 1, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Psionic Systems", "publishers": "Team17 Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.71", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40368-assassin-special-edition\n"}
