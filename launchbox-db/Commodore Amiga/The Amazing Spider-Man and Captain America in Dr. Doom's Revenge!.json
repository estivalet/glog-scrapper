As the lavishly-drawn comic bundled with the game explains, Spider-Man and Captain America must join forces to go to Latveria and foil his plans. The main action in the game is a side-scrolling beat 'em up, in which you alternately control the two characters. They each have their own moves to deal with The Rhino, Electro and other foes. Moves are context-sensitive based on the distance between your character and the opponent. Energy bars decrease as you each take hits. After each section you get comic-book sequences as a reward, and to set the scene of the evolving story.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Paragon Software", "publishers": "Empire Software", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.86", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man_and_Captain_America_in_Doctor_Doom%27s_Revenge", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/23837-the-amazing-spider-man-and-captain-america-in-dr-dooms-revenge\n"}
