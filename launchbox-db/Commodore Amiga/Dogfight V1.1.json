{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dogfight V1.1", "overview": "Dogfight is a PostcardWare developed and published by Richard Ling in 1995. Welcome to France, 1916. In those days, the life expectancy of young pilots like you was said to be about twenty minutes. In this game, twenty seconds is a more usual lifespan! You and a friend are the top aces of your time - the pride of the British and German air forces. In this game, there is no real purpose to life other than hearing the expiring whimper of the other player. There are only five simple controls in Dogfight. Pressing forward on the stick will accelerate. In auto mode, this is done for you, which makes it harder to stall. Moving the stick left will make your plane turn anticlockwise; that is, the British plane (which faces right) will pull up, and the German plane (facing left) will nosedive. Moving the stick right will turn your plane clockwise; that is, the German plane will pull up, and the British plane will nosedive. (The easiest way to see how this works is to load the game and try it.) Pressing the fire button will fire the plane\u2019s gun. Hold the button down for rapid fire. Finally, pulling back on the stick will drop a bomb (provided you are carrying any). Dogfight v1.1 should work fine on any Amiga, from an A500 up, provided it has at least 1 MB of memory.
