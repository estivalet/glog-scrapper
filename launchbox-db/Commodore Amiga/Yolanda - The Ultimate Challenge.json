{"altername_name": ["Yolanda"], "name": "Yolanda: The Ultimate Challenge", "overview": "The 16-bit box calls this \u2018The Ultimate Challenge\u2019 and they\u2019re not kidding; this flick-screen platform game is one of the toughest you\u2019ll come across. In the 8-bit versions Hercules has some titanic tasks to complete, whilst in the 16-bit versions his daughter Yolanda has been cursed and can only free herself by completing the same tasks. Unusually, the game\u2019s dozens of screens are given in a random order, with a different one after you lose each life. You have no weapon with which to harm the various creatures that lurk within. The pace of the enemies is quite hectic, but the real unique feature is that you must keep moving \u2013 each platform is set on fire a few seconds after you first touch it.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "VectorDean", "publishers": "Millennium Interactive", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/79321-yolanda-the-ultimate-challenge\n"}
