{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sid Meier's Colonization", "overview": "Sid Meier's Colonization is a Turn-Based Strategy game, developed and published by MicroProse, which was released in Europe in 1995. \u2018Go and make a world\u2019, they said. \u2018Do it by Wednesday night.\u2019 they said. \u2018And bring us back some chips.\u2019 Colonization is a fairly simply idea in theory but, thankfully, much more involved once you get going. Set sail in your little ship, bump into a bit of land that rightfully belongs to someone else, and then claim it as your own. Ah, the American way... This game is more to do with the discovery and development of the American continents during the period 1500-1800. This means that you can choose to either take part in the discovery of the New Worlds, or select to play over a random world - facing a totally different challenge every game. The ultimate goal here is to clarify your independence by attacking your original home land, and the English forces don\u2019t exactly consist of a small donkey and a bag of peanuts If you know what I mean. Your best strategy is to be as friendly as possible with everyone, until you\u2019ve had the chance to train up your folks to the point at which you know you can handle any trouble. Running away is the best form of defence. Probably. Colonization is a relatively original slant on the god sim genre and well worth purchasing, in my opinion.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "MicroProse", "publishers": "MicroProse", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.53", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sid_Meier%27s_Colonization", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/63403-sid-meiers-colonization\n"}
