{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bermuda Project", "overview": "Mirrorsoft's Amiga adventure sets the scene among sun-drenched islands to the north of the Caribbean. The sort of place you might expect to find cricket, good fishing and friendly people. It is also the location of one of the most mysterious puzzles of modern times - the Bermuda Triangle, an area of nearly three quarters of a million square miles between Florida. Bermuda and the Virgin Islands. In the Bermuda Project you play the part of Bill Benson, a top reporter for the New York Star and Herald on three months special leave to investigate a spate of disappearances within the infamous Triangle. It has never been far from the front page since a flight of American Naval planes vanished without trace in 1945. Many planes and ships have gone missing. Each time the complete absence of bodies or wreckage has fueled speculation of everything from instant mini-hurricanes to extraterrestrial intervention. There are quite a few objects to find most of which but not all, are useful. You can only carry a limited number in your backpack. If Bermuda Project were text only it would probably be very run-of-the-mill. The graphics and simplified mouse command change it into an entertaining game that most will enjoy.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Graphicfinal", "publishers": "Mirrorsoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/74939-bermuda-project\n"}
