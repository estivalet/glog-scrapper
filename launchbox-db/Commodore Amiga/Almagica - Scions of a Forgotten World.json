{"altername_name": [], "name": "Almagica: Scions of a Forgotten World", "overview": "Almagica: Scions Of A Forgotten World is an RTS not unlike Command & Conquer that was never ported to the platform. As Amiga was losing its commercial power, fewer and fewer games were ported to it, so the developers saw a business potential. In the end, the plan didn't work out as the game was never released. What was released however was a functional preview, letting us play this one. Gameplay follows the principles of the standard RTS formula. You click the mouse on any subject or building and a group of buttons specific to the selection pop ups on the right. From here you can tell workers to move to a certain location, start cutting down trees for lumber (an important commodity), or build buildings (what the lumber is for). Adding the different types of buildings allows you to increase the speed of growth of your population. The object is to build up your population and army and then wipe out the other tribes.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1997", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "DSP", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/159358-almagica-scions-of-a-forgotten-world\n"}
