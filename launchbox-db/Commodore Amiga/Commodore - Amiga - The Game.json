{"altername_name": [], "name": "Commodore - Amiga: The Game", "overview": "A single player Shoot'em Up made with the Shoot'em Up Construction Kit by J. Carp and released in 1995. It was released shortly after the bankruptcy of Commodore and is intended to send a final message to the company's failed executives. You play as the Amiga Boing Ball and make your final stand against Commodore's industry competitors. Enemies include the then-current logos of Microsoft, IBM, Apple, and Intel, which you fire the Workbench default cursor at. The level backgrounds are an Amiga mainboard with microchips, the Amiga Workbench, CompUSA shops, and a literal interpretation of the Internet as the information superhighway. At certain points, you encounter the Amiga Software Failure screen with red text on black and get attacked by what appears to be virus-infected disks. The last level of the game is truly something special.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "J.
