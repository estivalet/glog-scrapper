{"altername_name": ["Ancient Battles"], "name": "Encyclopedia of War: Ancient Battles", "overview": "This gem was supposed to be the first in a series by a small English company. The reviews at the time were glowing, but unfortunately the game didn't sell well. It comes with ready made scenarios from Ancient Egyptian times to the time of Rome. You can devise your own battles on custom-made battlefields easily with an astounding selection of historical units to choose from. Recreate ancient battles by finding out unit disposition and terrain or just play for fun. The problem with it, though, is that the units' movements are quite restrictive, so that there is not much room for tactical planning and maneuvering. Further, the scrolling is jumpy, and the game can be quite slow and un-rewarding. Gamers obsessed with battle games, and have patience, will like it.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Robert T.
