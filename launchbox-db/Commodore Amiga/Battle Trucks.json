{"altername_name": [], "name": "Battle Trucks", "overview": "A number of glaring flaws: The truck are drawn so large you don't see the track in front of you. Winning the first few tracks depends on memorization of the layout. Later on, the racing degenerates into a chaotic mess as you and your opponent spam guided missiles at each other. The graphics are ugly. There is no music. Very poor for a commercial release.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Richard G.
