{"altername_name": [], "name": "Storm Master", "overview": "Storm Master is a 1991 turn-based strategy video game produced and published by Silmarils. It placed the player as the head of government for a fictional semi-medieval country. The game is a blend of turn-based strategy interspersed with live-action battles. This takes the form of aerial battles against enemy air fleets or air defences and requires the player to launch ballistic missiles against enemy ships or batteries. Other real-time elements of the game have the player conducting a religious ceremony with the goal of increasing the natural wind energy of the nation. This element of gameplay is enhanced by requiring the player to dispatch government ministers around the country to develop or industrialise various aspects of the state.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Silmarils", "publishers": "Silmarils", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_Master", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2A_d68j_RNo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/24039-storm-master\n"}
