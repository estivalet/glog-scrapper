{"altername_name": ["Tetrid 3"], "name": "Tetrid III", "overview": "Game created by Shaun Watters of Zamara Productions and released in 1994. To complete the level you must cover 95% of the grid with Tetris shapes. You can reject current blocks but this reduces your time. Eventually this idea would be recycled in a 1-4 player game and called Blokus that would be made into a incredibly popular board game.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Zamara Productions", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSdj_ly2VbI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162770-tetrid-iii\n"}
