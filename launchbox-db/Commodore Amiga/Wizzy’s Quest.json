The game is a Solomon's Key type platformer, or a Spherical clone some might say. The aim of the game is to reach the Dragon. All 50 levels must be completed to do this. In every Level there is Wizzy, his Master and one door It is your task to bring the master to the door without running into one of the many, many monsters that you will meet. To achieve this you can make stone blocks appear and also disappear, you may also use some of the many objects available.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Guido Appenzelle", "publishers": "The One (Coverdisk)", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3DmtGMr4Pg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165045-wizzys-quest\n"}
