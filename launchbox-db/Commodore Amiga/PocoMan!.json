{"altername_name": [], "name": "PocoMan!", "overview": "PocoMan! is a Soko-Ban clone, featuring PocoMan \u2014 the \"21st century super-hero of microscopic proportions,\" as he is described in the Windows version's help file \u2014 imprisoned in a trap made of fifty mazes which must all be solved to escape. On each level, the player must push all the objects onto the target spots (marked with X's). As usual for Sokoban games, only one crate can be pushed at a time and they cannot be pulled, so the player must be careful not to get stuck. Completing each level unlocks the next one. The protagonist can be moved with the keyboard, or by clicking and holding the mouse on the target square. Additionally, by Shift-clicking, the player can enable the \"Super-Poco-Mode\" where PocoMan constantly follows the cursor movements. A single crate push can be undone at any time.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Sleepless Software", "publishers": "Designing Minds", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147952-pocoman\n"}
