{"altername_name": ["Fallen Empire"], "name": "Ashes of Empire", "overview": "The Confederation of Syndicalist Republics is the setting for this strategy and combat game. Much like the similar looking USSR at the time, the society is crumbling, and you are an upstart aiming to take over power for yourself \u2026.. erm, I mean, aiming to bring peace, harmony, prosperity and happiness. You start off in a small coastal province, and must progress by meeting people and negotiating to get them on your side \u2013 sometimes the sword is mightier than the pen, sometimes not. You must ensure that the more militant locals are pacified, and that ethnic minorities are looked after. While those sections are all strategic, there are also some vector-based combat sections. These ensure that brawns are required along with brains, and give the game some variety.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Midnight", "publishers": "Mirage Technologies (Multimedia) Ltd.", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashes_of_Empire", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73838-ashes-of-empire\n"}
