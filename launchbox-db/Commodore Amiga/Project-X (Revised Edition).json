{"altername_name": ["Project-X: Special Edition '93"], "name": "Project-X (Revised Edition)", "overview": "Project-X (Revised Edition) is a slightly enhanced version of Project-X, and was released by Team 17 at a budget price in 1993. Release of this enhanced version was mostly prompted by customer feedback that the difficulty level of the original (particularly level 2) was too high. Enhancements include: - Inclusion of a rookie mode allowing players making easier to progress to later levels - Starting the game with a better ship - Shortened levels - Removal of some extremely difficult passages of play from game levels - Reducing the amount of disk swapping by fitting the game on 3 disks instead of the original edition's 4 disks", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Team17 Software", "publishers": "Team17 Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project-X", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tih1QIUG2WE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72827-project-x-revised-edition\n"}
