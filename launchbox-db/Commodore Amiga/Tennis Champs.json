It was pre-released under the name of Arcade Sports Tennis. Coded in AMOS by the excellently named Elton and Elliot Bird, manages to be better than all of them by taking its inspiration from the world of consoles and simply being a lot of fun. A clever and intuitive control system allows all manner of shots to be played with a one-button joystick. There are four different playing surfaces and a variety of players to choose from, and even a tournament mode.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mental Image", "publishers": "Amiga Power", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AT46HTi_RhU&ab_channel=AlexMenchi", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165381-tennis-champs\n"}
