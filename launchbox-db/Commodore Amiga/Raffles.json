{"altername_name": ["Devon Aire in the Hidden Diamond Caper"], "name": "Raffles", "overview": "An eccentric old millionaire stored all his gems and money in odd places around his mansion. When he dies, his widow is unable to find any of this, so she hires master thief Devon Aire to look in the places his criminal mindset suggests it will be stored. Each room of the house is viewed isometrically, and contains all the features you would expect to find in a large house, from cookers and telephones to pool tables and paintings. Each one can be picked up, pushed, pulled and used, with the diamonds located in intricate and surprising places. Due to Mr. Croucher's keen interest in experimental science, there are also monsters moving through the rooms. Contact with these reduces some of the energy on one of your 3 lives.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Softek International Ltd.", "publishers": "The Edge", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_Outing", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106619-raffles\n"}
