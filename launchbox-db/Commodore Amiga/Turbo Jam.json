The car is constantly moving forward and most of the player's control involve steering it left and right at intersections. It is however also possible to speed up and to reverse slowly. In each level of the game the objective is to collect all the flags which appear on the screen one at a time. Similar to Head-On there are chaser cars that are out after the player and it' necessary to avoid crashing into these. If that happens a life will be lost. To help the player it's possible to pick up fireballs that then can be launched and used to destroy the chasing cars.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Phelios Development", "publishers": "Phelios Development", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIs0oWUnHqY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161819-turbo-jam\n"}
