{"altername_name": [], "name": "Numtris 2", "overview": "A Tetris game with numbers rather than colors. This is an educational version of the now classic Tetris. As you might have guessed, the game involves numbers. There are three difficulty levels, level 1 isn't too bad, but Level 3 will tax everyone who hasn't got a calculator for a brain! In this game you have to build up columns of bricks each of which has a number to make up the target number at the bottom of the screen. The hard part is remembering the existing totals for each column so that you can out the next brick in the best place -if you exceed the target number, then that column is 'dead' until a 'zap' brick comes along which will allow you to wipe out the whole column. Getting the exact target number will give you a new number to create.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Andrew Greaney", "publishers": "Andrew Greaney", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164375-numtris-2\n"}
