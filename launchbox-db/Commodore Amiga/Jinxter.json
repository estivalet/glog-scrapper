The task of finding five charms and a magic bracelet to put things right falls on you. And you need a change of luck, because events in this game often emphasise the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. You get hit by a car, fall a great height, sprayed with cheese sandwich and more! Being the guinea pig in this strange world will drive you insane - if this jinxed land doesn't do it first.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "magnetic Scrolls", "publishers": "Rainbird Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.07", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinxter", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Di4ORnfG1mM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73978-jinxter\n"}
