{"altername_name": [], "name": "Starbirds", "overview": "Starbirds is a shoot'em up-game in the style of those old classics like R-Type, Wings of Death, Apidya etc. Development started in 1993 and finished in 1996. At this time it became clear that it is useless to try to sell such a game commercially, because the AMIGA market has shrunk and even only a part of all AMIGA people were really interested in shoot-em up games (and a lot of them probably hadn't bought the original game). Finally the decision was made to provide the game as freeware to everyone. From the developer of WarpsOS PPC libries comes a shootem up for the Classic Amiga. Running on an A500 this game goes back to a simpler time and brings in a little modern gameplay style. It may look like an Amiga game from 1989 - but its got the qualities of later games such as ProjectX / RType ect.. What makes this game a bit different is that you can take a different path through the level which changes which enemies are faced. The difficulty option also changes what enemies are in the level and also there flight paths ! Tapping fire button shoots normal weapon (usualy forwards) and holding fire fires secondary weapon (rear and/or sides)", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Haage-Partner", "publishers": "", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.62", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reuvtspLM3g", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/155486-starbirds\n"}
