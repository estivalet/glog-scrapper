{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tile Fall", "overview": "Tile Fall is a fun, simple, and very addictive game, in which you attempt to remove a number of coloured tiles from a grid. Tiles can be removed providing that are touching another tile the same colour on at least one edge. Removing small groups of tiles (2 or 3 together) provide very small scores, but by removing other tiles, it is possible to get very large groups of tiles of a single colour. Removing these large groups results in drastically higher scores. As tiles are removed, the surrounding tiles fall down to fill the spaces left. The game continues until no groups of 2 or more tiles are available.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1997", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Adam Dawes", "publishers": "", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZA3zvLn7ck", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164713-tile-fall\n"}
