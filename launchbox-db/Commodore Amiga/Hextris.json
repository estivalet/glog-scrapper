{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hextris", "overview": "Hextris is a Tetris clone that was one of the many of this type of Amiga game to introduce hexagonal (beehive-shaped) blocks as the name suggests. The edges of the playing area are also hexagonal-shaped to fit the blocks. The game is more difficult as a result, since there are many more exposed edges that must fit with other tiles - five as opposed to three in a normal Tetris game. This version is by Ives Aerts and came out in 1992 and was for one or two players.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ives Aerts", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/163957-hextris\n"}
