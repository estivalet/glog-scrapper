{"altername_name": [], "name": "Leavin' Teramis", "overview": "In Leavin' Teramis the titular space ship gets conquered by aliens. The whole crew has managed to flee - except Nigel MacGibbons who slept through the evacuation due to his nightly drinking activities. Now he needs to reach the last escape pod by finding his way through ten levels, all with a big boss at the end. From an overhead perspective, the player controls MacGibbons through the corridors and rooms of the ship, scrolling in multiple directions. Despite controlling a human instead of a ship, the game is a straight shooter: using a gun to kill everything that moves while dodging enemy attacks and bullets. Getting hit reduces the energy bar and when it reaches zero, a life is lost. Special symbols give advantages when picked up, like extra time on the time limit, extra lives or weapon upgrades.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Thalion", "publishers": "Thalion", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/91858-leavin-teramis\n"}
