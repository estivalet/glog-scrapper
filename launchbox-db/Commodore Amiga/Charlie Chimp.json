{"altername_name": [], "name": "Charlie Chimp", "overview": "Charlie Chimp is a platform game, developed and published by Europress, which was released in Europe in 1993. Charlie Chimp won a AMOS game-competition, is what is mentioned at the start of the game. Well, to be honest, I don't think there was much competition. Charlie Chimp is a bit of a CarVup rip-off. It even \"borrows\" a lot of the game sounds of that game. What is it all about? You are Charlie, a chimp (surprise surprise!) and you have to walk around the levels changing the colour of all the platforms. There are all sorts of enemies walking around who try to stop you in your quest, but you can hit them with a tennis racket. There is a time limit and when you take too long, an evil big enemy appears who will try to stop you. Compared to CarVup this isn't very good and I would say, just play that game if you like the concept. Charlie Chimp isn't bad, but CarVup just is better, I think.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Europress Software", "publishers": "Europress Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/63164-charlie-chimp\n"}
