{"altername_name": [], "name": "Space Pilot of Death", "overview": "An endless asteroids dodging game from Marten Wobst aka Goldmomo with graphics by Arboris, with tagline of \"You will not survive\". There is no shooting in this 2021 homebrew game, you must simply maneuver, doge and survive. You have a shield of limited power that will take some of the brunt of a glancing contact with the asteroid field but it won't last forever. Hiscore is saved after game exit (unprotect your floppy disk if used).", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2021", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Arboris", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-lSF_QYzFQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164639-space-pilot-of-death\n"}
