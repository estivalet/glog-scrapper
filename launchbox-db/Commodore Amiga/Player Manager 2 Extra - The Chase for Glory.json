{"altername_name": ["Player Manager 2 Extra", "Willi Lemkes Fussballmanager"], "name": "Player Manager 2 Extra: The Chase for Glory", "overview": "When this game arrived in it was hard to find any difference, apart from the obvious graphical ones and a bit more speed in the player section, between it and the original. Your aim in Player Manager 2 Extra is to raise a team from division 2 capable of winning promotion to the Premier League as well as competing in Europe. You are pitted against three other managers who can be either computer or human controlled. These guys are pretty smart too. The big change in PM2 Extra is that the graphics have all been upgraded. The tactics editor is still brilliant though. If this is your area of interest then PM2E stands out as the best. All in all, PM2E is a very competent management simulator and if you like the Kick Off series then you'll enjoy the Kick Off playing engine. Though still a solid game it's not that much better than the first version to warrant an upgrade (A1200) unless you're a real fan.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Anco Software", "publishers": "Anco Software", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72678-player-manager-2-extra-the-chase-for-glory\n"}
