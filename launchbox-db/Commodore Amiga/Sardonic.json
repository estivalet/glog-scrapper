{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sardonic", "overview": "A top scrolling shoot em up by MADAXE, and features music by FRED. In this game you play as the yellow ship at the bottom of the screen and must make your way through the level blasting away enemies, collecting power ups, and destroying the boss at the end to continue on to an ever harder level. And that's pretty much it, as if you're expecting a very high quality in your face shoot em up you'll be disappointed, as although there's background graphics and a cool soundtrack.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2019", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "MadAxe", "publishers": "Penisoft", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7GgdimB3ZU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162095-sardonic\n"}
