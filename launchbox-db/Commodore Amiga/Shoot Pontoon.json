{"altername_name": [], "name": "Shoot Pontoon", "overview": "A single player casino game from Bryan Black. Shoot Pontoon is simply a more money oriented version of everyone's fave card game Pontoon, Blackjack or 21. You start off with one card each and must bet based on this card. The banker will now deal you another card. From here you can now stick (if you have more than 16), twist (which costs you nothing but the banker will know your card) or buy by adding to the pot to buy another card, but the bet remains the same. If you have 14 or less with 2 cards you can also burn to get 2 new cards. If you win against the banker you will take your bets back from the pot as well as the same amount from the banker. If the banker runs out of money you have won, but the reverse is also true.
