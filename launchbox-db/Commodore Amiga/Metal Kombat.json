{"altername_name": [], "name": "Metal Kombat", "overview": "Metal Kombat is a Polish 2D side scrolling Beat 'Em Up game. It is set in a post-apocalyptic future. Mankind was exterminated and two robot fractions (Amiga and PC) are fighting against each other for the dominance on Earth. The player controls one of six available robots. Each of them has its own moves and different fighting techniques. The gameplay is pretty similar to Final Fight or Double Dragon when you have to beat all enemies attacking you from either the left or the right side of the screen. Defeated enemies fall apart for scrap and the player can proceed further. The game is divided into 14 levels and can be played solo or with a human friend. Apart from the main game there are also two sub-games selected via menu of the game: two player only, one on one Beat 'Em Up and Operation Wolf-like simple Shoot 'Em Up.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Deck Six", "publishers": "MarkSoft", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "2.3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BQ2iF7V9dE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72344-metal-kombat\n"}
