{"altername_name": [], "name": "Riamel: Black Prophecy", "overview": "A combination of isometric adventure game and a dungeon crawler, with tons of unusual possibilities, contains various cities, spells, ship cruising, battling 2D and 3D (vector) enemies and much more. Quite hard and a manual is a must. All that is available online as the original commercial creators worked with the Amiga scene to make sure it was available to TOSEC and Hall of Light. Every game can be different as a random shuffling of the puzzle parameters happens at the start of each new game.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bob Postma", "publishers": "Steve Postma", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6UCdD74cuI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164895-riamel-black-prophecy\n"}
