{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Experiment", "overview": "In the game, YOU play the part of Bud Lightning - clean cut, shade wearing, all round nice-guy (except he doesn't wear shades) as he tries to save a Primitive Tribe from extinction after his base is destroyed by the Evil Stingons. Along the way, you do a whole lot of other stuff, such as capture snail furry creatures, kill aliens, negotiate dark forests and mountainsides, discover Lost Alien Cities and generally save the Universe from Destruction. You may remember the Stingons from Starbase 13. Yes, they are the sane Stingons. In fact, the whole universe is the same - the UP and everything. Another link is that Bud is an old academy friend of Yeno Hou's younger brother, Duno Hou. This is not mentioned in the game.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "DAS Software", "publishers": "F1 Licenceware", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/91080-the-experiment\n"}
