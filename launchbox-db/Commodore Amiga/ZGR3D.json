The aim of the player is to destroy Tetris-like blocks that fall down from the top of the screen. With each move the whole line of blocks drops down one line unless it cannot go further because the composition of the game field does not allow it. The player needs to move carefully through the field destroying the blocks without being squashed.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2020", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Project R3D", "publishers": "CDLabel", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGPlD3y_tic", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161889-zgr3d\n"}
