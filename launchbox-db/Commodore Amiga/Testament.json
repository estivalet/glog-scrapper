{"altername_name": [], "name": "Testament", "overview": "Testament is another Doom-clone for the Amiga. Compared to the other games released at about the same time, Testament looks a bit simple. It plays more like Wolfenstein 3D than Doom, with no staircases or elevations, and plenty of similar looking mazes. The controls are quite simple, and you can't jump, crouch or anything like that. Each level consists of a maze laid out on one floor. The goal is to reach a scroll at the end of the level, and in addition to the enemies out to kill you, you'll have to find a set of four keys to unlock doors blocking your progress. What Testament scores high on is atmosphere and tension. It has bucketloads of both. The mazes are dark and scary, and the levels feel very claustrophobic. The presentation is good. While the 3D engine is simple, it is also very fast. The sound effects do a good job of enforcing the dark, gloomy atmosphere of the game. There's also simple (but effective) background music playing on each level. All in all, Testament is a worthy addition to your first person shooter collection. Even though there aren't any groundbreaking gameplay features in Testament, it is a hugely entertaining and atmospheric game which stands up surprisingly well when compared to the best 3D shooters of today.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Insanity", "publishers": "Islona", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.38", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testament_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3w-nEvjOXE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73604-testament\n"}
