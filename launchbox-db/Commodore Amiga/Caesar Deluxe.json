{"altername_name": [], "name": "Caesar Deluxe", "overview": "The object of Caesar is to help the empire by establishing a city within the province over which you have jurisdiction. Building the city is difficult because you must monitor many aspects of its development, but your ability as a governor are represented by the four pillars of Roman civilization: Peace, Culture, Prosperity and Empire. Increasing each of these is hard, but the difficulty of juggling several problems at once is what makes Caesar fascinating. Overall, the game has been polished in all respects, right down to packaging and documentation, but do not expect this to be a sequel. Impressions have almost achieved a version that is genuinely 'Deluxe', but you have to ask yourself whether it was worth paying more money for a what is only a very slight upgrade.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Golden Sector Design", "publishers": "Impressions Games", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/88729-caesar-deluxe\n"}
