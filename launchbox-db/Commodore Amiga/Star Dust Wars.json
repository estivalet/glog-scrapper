{"altername_name": [], "name": "Star Dust Wars", "overview": "Take on the Empire in this 2.5D space shooter set around the battle of Yavin from the A New Hope. Recreates the Death Star battle from the finale of Star Wars: A New Hope. TIE Fighters attack from the front while larger Empire and Rebel battleships pass by in the distance. Looks pretty good for an AMOS game, especially the Death Star trench sequence at the end. If you activate music in the options, you get to hear the Star Wars main theme once but it could use more music.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2018", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Electric Black Sheep", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDmdaO800AQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161825-star-dust-wars\n"}
