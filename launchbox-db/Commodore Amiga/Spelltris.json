{"altername_name": [], "name": "Spelltris", "overview": "Spelltris from Gerry Quinn on the Amiga. Spelltris is similar to Tetris, except that single letters fall down and you have to make (English) words from them. If you make a word it disappears and the letters above fall down - sometimes causing more words to be formed. (It's more like Columns really...) The game recognises 25000 words. There are options to make the game harder or easier, depending on your skill level. It can speak the words or play music. Spelltris was on the coverdisk of Amiga User International (September 1995).", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gerry Quinn", "publishers": "AUI", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSod-p97lEk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162620-spelltris\n"}
