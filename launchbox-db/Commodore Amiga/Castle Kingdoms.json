{"altername_name": [], "name": "Castle Kingdoms", "overview": "Castle Kingdoms is an Action Adventure game, developed and published by Mutation Software, which was released in Europe in 1997. This is an isometric arcade-adventure. You control a party of four brave warriors who each have their own individual strengths and weaknesses, and you must fight your way through five castles filled with bad guys. You can only control one character at a time, though, and the others will follow the character under your control. The game was fun enough to play, and the presentation is good, with some nice music in the background and unremarkable, but cute, graphics. All in all, Castle Kingdoms is an okay game - for an hour or two. The game is available as a part of a couple of compilations: Mutantology (Epic Marketing), and Mutation Gold (Mutation Software).", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Mutation Software", "publishers": "Mutation Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/63120-castle-kingdoms\n"}
