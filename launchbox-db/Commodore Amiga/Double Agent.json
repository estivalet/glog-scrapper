{"altername_name": [], "name": "Double Agent", "overview": "Double Agent is an enhanced clone of well known 8-bit computers hit Spy vs. Spy. The game features numerous missions where players compete with each other in the execution of the assignment. The tasks require carrying out specific actions before you can escape from the building. In each location various items (heavy ball, electrical device, lit cigar) can be found that can be used for setting creative booby traps inside plants, desks, file cabinets and other furniture. All traps can be disarmed with objects found in the rooms. Contact with a trap takes some of the energy. Another difficulty is the third agent that appears after some time pledging traps and attacking the other two. Each agent has a shotgun, which can be used against the enemy. Death means the loss of all items and moves the agent to the initial position.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Flair Software", "publishers": "Flair Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.21", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/80299-double-agent\n"}
