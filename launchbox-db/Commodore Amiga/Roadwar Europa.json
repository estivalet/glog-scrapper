{"altername_name": [], "name": "Roadwar Europa", "overview": "In the year 1999, weapons of mass destruction have already devastated America. In Roadwar Europa, designed by the team that would produce Pool of Radiance and Command and Conquer, it's up to you and your road gang to stop terrorists before they unleash the same deadly plague on Europe. Though best played after Roadwar 2000 since it allows you to bring your old gang over from the first game, you can also design from scratch a new posse of armsmasters, bodyguards, doctors, and escorts. What's left of the European Union is as deadly as the United States in the first game. With all the roving villains, your party is as likely as not to be eliminated in the blink of an eye if you choose the quick combat resolution option. So if someone gives you trouble while you're looting the countryside for tires, choose \u201cdetailed combat\u201d and see if you have what it takes to be the Napoleon of road warriors.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Westwood Associates", "publishers": "Strategic Simulations", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72881-roadwar-europa\n"}
