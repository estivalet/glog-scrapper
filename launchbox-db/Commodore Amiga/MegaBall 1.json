{"altername_name": [], "name": "MegaBall 1", "overview": "1991 saw the release of MegaBall on the Amiga systems, a Breakout clone, created and distributed by Ed Mackey and Al Mackey as a Shareware. You all know how to play an Arkanoid clone, right? I don't have to explain that you have a paddle and a ball and you must bounce the ball into some blocks to score points, right? And I certainly don't need to mention that if you let the ball miss the paddle and drop off the screen you will die, right? And I also don't need to explain about how little bonuses can drift down from the blocks and if they touch your paddle they can do anything from giving you free lives to blowing you up, depending on the little pictures on the bonuses as they are drifting down, right? Good. I was afraid I'd have to put a lengthy explanation here!
