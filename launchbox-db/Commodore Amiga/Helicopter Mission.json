{"altername_name": [], "name": "Helicopter Mission", "overview": "In this game you are the pilot of a battle helicopter of the Federal Armed Forces of Germany (Deutsche Bundeswehr), who also produced the game. Your objective is to fly search and rescue missions and supporting missions in countries abroad. The perspective and gameplay slightly resemble that of similar games from the period, such as Electronic Arts' Strike series. There are no fighting missions in the game. Instead you save civilians from accidents, and natural disasters by picking them up by dropping food packets. Reflecting the legislation at the time, the player gets to choose between a male and female copilot. If you choose the woman, the game will tell you that women can't become pilots, thus essentially forcing you to go with a man.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Rauser Advertainment", "publishers": "Bundeswehr", "genres": "Flight Simulator", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113771-helicopter-mission\n"}
