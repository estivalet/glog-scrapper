The player now has the honorable task of restoring the unadulterated original state of the little pictures with his mouse. Ahh, I know that, some people will now say to themselves, these sliding puzzles have always brought me to the brink of despair since my earliest childhood! Exactly right, as simple as the whole thing sounds, it is difficult in practice; In addition, you have to fight against a time limit when you're playing Sliding. The controls work perfectly, the sound is quite entertaining- and the pictures themselves? Well, one can say that the \"United Graphic Artists\" justifiably bear their proud name, because the graphics are really well done. Incidentally, the game is also excellently suited for several players who (one after the other) test their skills.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Daniel Ockeloen", "publishers": "UGA", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/368459-sliding\n"}
