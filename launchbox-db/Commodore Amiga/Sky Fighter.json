{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sky Fighter", "overview": "Sky Fighter is a vertically scrolling shooter without plot; the goal simply being to survive all levels and get a high score. The player controls a space ship which is attacked by various flying enemies and ground bases; he can defend himself either by using the standard attack or one of the limited bombs. The ship can take up to nine hits (one life) and needs regular refueling by hitting an energy tank with a bomb, which are automatically refilled at the end of the level. A speciality is the memory test after every level: the player needs to remember which enemy typed were on the level's ground stations - the rewards for a correct guess are more bombs and a point bonus.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Digital Artwork", "publishers": "Anco Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/131492-sky-fighter\n"}
