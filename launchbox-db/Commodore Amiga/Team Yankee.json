{"altername_name": [], "name": "Team Yankee", "overview": "Yankee can\u2019t compare with M-1 for realism, but it\u2019s an extremely playable and enjoyable sim. The essence of the game is a mix of tactics \u2013 critical in positioning your forces and timing artillery strikes \u2013 and arcade action. Swiveling the turret, finding the enemy, getting a laser lock-on, waiting for a round to be loaded then knocking a tank out all requires good reactions. Then as soon as the first shot hits, the rest of the platoon will know your position and return fire, so it\u2019s critical to take them all out quickly. This is great fun, helped along by great graphics. Up close things are blocky, especially the UDG-style forests, but overall the effect is top-notch. The game\u2019s only real drawback is the lack of scenarios. Enemy intelligence does increase dramatically as ranks improve, but new scenarios would\u2019ve been best.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Oxford Digital Enterprises", "publishers": "Empire Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Yankee_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIMRDW-8Wkk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73574-team-yankee\n"}
