{"altername_name": [], "name": "Knights", "overview": "Knights is a violent action game for two players. You define the dungeon, starting equipment and if there are wands, books or gems to be found. Two players explore the dungeon, avoid traps, find treasure, complete the quests and fortify until it is time to fight! Each game revolves around a quest \u2013 for example, you might have to find some items and carry them back to your starting point. This may sound easy, but as there are only enough items in the dungeon for one player to win, you may end up having to kill your opponents to get their stuff! Other quests involve escaping from the dungeon, fighting a duel to the death against the enemy knights, or destroying an ancient Book using a special Wand. While exploring, you will find various items to aid you. Hammers can smash down wooden obstacles. Axes can be thrown or swung at your opponents. Potions and scrolls will give you (temporary) powers. But beware, for there are also dangers, including deadly traps, bloodthirsty vampire bats, and zombies who exist only to kill living knights! Although this game can be a bit complicated to learn at first (due to the large number of weapons and items available), it is great fun and the customizable quests and random dungeons make it highly replayable. It can be played online, over a LAN, or in split screen mode.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kalle Marjola", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmNELaGZmrQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161217-knights\n"}
