{"altername_name": [], "name": "Wild Wheels", "overview": "Wild Wheels is an action game in which two teams of five cars each try to bring a ball into other team's goal for points (more points are awarded for risky moves) and destroying all enemy cars. The player takes control over a single car which can be shown in various camera positions, most prominently directly behind the vehicle or top-down. There are also special fields on the field which grant advantages when passed. The single-player portion basically consists of a series of elimination matches with the goal to win all leagues of increasing difficulty levels. Between matches, the points earned with goals can be reinvested into new cars with better statistics - additionally they are also divided into five categories with different roles during the matches. The game features two control modes: in professional mode the player rotates the car when pushing left or right while arcade mode allows direct turns.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Red Rat Software", "publishers": "Ocean Software Ltd.", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.12", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nEbRBw2vz8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/104807-wild-wheels\n"}
