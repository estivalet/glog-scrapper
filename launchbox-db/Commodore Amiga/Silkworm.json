{"altername_name": [], "name": "Silkworm", "overview": "Silkworm is a classic horizontally-scrolling shoot-em-up. The main difference between this game and many other side-scrolling shoot-em-ups is that you will be on land as well as in the air. The first player would play as a helicopter, but if a second player joins the game, they would play as a jeep. Both players would have to protect each other as well as themselves. After a certain number of kills, a \"goose\" helicopter would form on the screen. If the players managed to destroy it they would get a weapon's powerup. This would go on throughout the entire game, and a \"goose\" could appear even during the fight with the end-of-level baddie.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Random Access", "publishers": "Virgin Mastertronic", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.04", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silkworm_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/z3kN1rblzhI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/71980-silkworm\n"}
