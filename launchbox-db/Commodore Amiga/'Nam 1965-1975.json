{"altername_name": [], "name": "'Nam 1965-1975", "overview": "A rather unique war game simulation. You can decide to be several different people and the game is created after the way you make your choice. The game engine and interface are pretty simple as all you have to do is to deploy units, offer support to your allies and decide on what military you are going to need. Depending on what you choose to do the news will change in the a newspaper you can read (the is how the game tells about all events in the game) which is rather nice, because that makes the overview of the game very good. The game does offer pretty good graphics all though it isn't really needed for a game like this. But is definitely a plus.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "The Kremlin", "publishers": "Domark", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5NEoJFeTaM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72543-nam-1965-1975\n"}
