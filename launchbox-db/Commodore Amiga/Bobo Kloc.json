{"altername_name": ["Bobokloc"], "name": "Bobo Kloc", "overview": "Bobo Kloc is a timed arcade puzzle-board game from Jan Guzik and Ewelina \u017byradzka with two gameplay modes. Accessing the next stage requires removing or gathering all of the tiles and objects placed on the board. There are ten types of tiles, removal requires a collision with another block of the same type. The task is complicated by numerous bugs (contact with them means a loss of life), objects (box, bulb, wall, rock) and types of surfaces (ice, rocks, swamp). The bugs are divided into intelligent, lethargic and nervous, differing in the speed and the way of movement. The game features also some power up items, such us snowflake (temporarily freeze enemies), bomb (kills one wave of enemies), hearth (extra life), clock (extra time), level pass (next level), floppy disk (extra points), teleport (gate to another part of the board) and in game hints. In Bobo mode Amigafly can change the direction of movement after hitting an obstacle (wall, box, object, end of the board) or reaching special blocking surface (swamp). This type of game requires quick planning and predicting the path of movement while avoiding numerous enemies on board. By contrast, there are no restrictions in movement in the Kloc mode. Bobo mode features 110 levels, Kloc mode 50. After each completed level the player receives an access password. The game was originally created for the polish side of LK Avalon but was not published at the time. The game has built-in level editor, allowing to add an own set of the boards.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Guzik Zyradzka", "publishers": "", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9AmQ9uE_wc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164787-bobo-kloc\n"}
