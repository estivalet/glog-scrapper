{"altername_name": [], "name": "Final Splatt", "overview": "A side-view 2D game with a feel very much like Worms. Intended for 2 player or tournament play. You have 100 seconds to pick up any goodies, get the lay of the land and blast your enemy. Unlike Worms the two players do this simultaneously in a world dominated by treacherous waters, boiling lava and potions and goodies that pop up for a few moments and then disappear.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1997", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Raccoon Software", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxYthO2GdCM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162757-final-splatt\n"}
