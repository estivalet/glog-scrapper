{"altername_name": [], "name": "Project 1", "overview": "This is \"Project 1\" for the Commodore Amiga. It was released back in 1988 as a coverdisk for the \"Amiga Fun\" magazine. The game was developed by Coma programming team. It is a \"River Raid\" clone for the Amiga and it is a good one. The graphics are nice, well colored and with enough detail. The downside of the game is that it is very very hard. It demands pixel perfect control of your ship and it doesn't forgive any mistake. Although the controls are very responsive it is the inertia feature that makes the ship control a difficult job.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Coma", "publishers": "Amiga Fun", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5bPv4x0b-E", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/131429-project-1\n"}
