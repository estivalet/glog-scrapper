{"altername_name": [], "name": "International Soccer Challenge", "overview": "The sequel to Microprose Soccer features an innovative 3-D perspective, viewed from just behind the ball with you always playing \u2018into\u2019 the screen. Shooting passing involves holding down fire to increase the power, and then moving the joystick to put height, direction and swerve onto the ball \u2013 on the easiest of three skill levels, passes are automatically aimed. As in Kick Off 2, you can either control a single player or switch between team members (excluding the automatic goalie). You can either play in a fictional world club Superleague, or try to win the World Cup, and save your position to disk. Extensive practice options allow you to perfect passing, penalty kicks, goalkeeping (on penalties) and corners. The 3-D view must have seemed a good idea at the time, but sadly it just doesn\u2019t come off: as well as being a bit jerky it\u2019s too slow for the supposedly high pace of a football game. It also means that there can\u2019t be a two-player mode \u2013 usually the best option in sports sims. As with Microprose Soccer, the ball is glued to the player\u2019s foot, so no skill is needed to dribble \u2013 contrarily, tackling the opposition is very tricky. It\u2019s also easy to score with a set routine of running diagonally at goal and swerving your shot. This one\u2019s no substitute for Kick Off 2.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "MicroStyle", "publishers": "Red Rat Software", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.88", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Soccer_Challenge", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyfbfFgzyVw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/71436-international-soccer-challenge\n"}
