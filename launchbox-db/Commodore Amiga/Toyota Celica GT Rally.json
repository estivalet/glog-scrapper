{"altername_name": [], "name": "Toyota Celica GT Rally", "overview": "On their way to becoming kings of the racing game, Gremlin produced this. It gives you a four-wheel drive rally car and a whole load of stages to race through. You have a 3D behind-the-wheel view, including hands, gauges and everything! The simple idea is to stay on the track while going as quickly as possible. You race the clock, not other drivers directly, and crashes earn you point penalties so care is needed. Nonetheless Celica is very exciting, and the implementation of a sliding, bucking rally car is very well done. Churches, houses and other inconsequential objects rush by the windows, all done with smoothness and speed, and the sound is excellent. This is one computer game that actually sounds like a car. The only problem is that you can\u2019t race other cars directly, and that rallying is a difficult skill to master (seeing as you don\u2019t have any feeling for which direction the car is actually traveling in. Persevere, learn the ancient art of driving rapidly on muddy surfaces and in appalling conditions and you\u2019ll be rewarded, but if you\u2019re after a quick speed-hit, you\u2019ll end up in a ditch in record time.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gremlin Graphics Software", "publishers": "Gremlin Graphics Software", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.83", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Celica_GT", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaVUokxJUFw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/71646-toyota-celica-gt-rally\n"}
