{"altername_name": [], "name": "Asgard Met Vikings", "overview": "Released at the Evoke-Demoparty in August 2013. Asgard Met Vikings is an arcade style game where you (optionally joined by a friend) must catch falling bottles of mead that Odin is generously dropping from the sky whilst avoiding and/or battering the endless hordes of Goblins trying to nab your booze. Should any green skinned thieves get too close and you'll get hit and start to flash - and by that I mean actually visibly flash, not disrobe and display your Viking family jewels.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "August 3, 2013", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "pinhead", "publishers": "Paradise", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiR1IUjfk08", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161924-asgard-met-vikings\n"}
