{"altername_name": ["Imbrium"], "name": "Imbrium: Day Of Reckoning", "overview": "This game will be instantly recognizable to those of you who have played the C64\\Spectrum game, Magic Knight. The character can be moved using the joystick and interact with objects using the menu system. For example standing next to a book you may be able to examine it, by selecting examine from the main menu or pick it up and use it. Other menu options will appear only when certain criteria are met, for instance you will only be able to read most books when you are carrying them. You can speak and trade with other characters near you. It is recommended you talk to all characters. The world of Imbrium represents a dynamically changing environment, so during the course of the game objects and characters may move. If you get stuck, consider rechecking things you have previously looked at.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "David Mort", "publishers": "CLR Licenceware", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/163986-imbrium-day-of-reckoning\n"}
