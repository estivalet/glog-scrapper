{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tales from Heaven", "overview": "Tales from Heaven is a 3D varied-viewpoint platformer resembling things like Mario 64 and Pandemonium, with over 2000 polygons on screen at a time, and morphing and transparency effects. In Tales From Heaven you play as Zak, who must chase after his beloved cat, not only for his own benefit but also to retrieve a sacred talisman required to save a land above the clouds. Your main weapon to progress through the 12 levels are a supply of bombs, of which more can be collected as you play. These have a 3-second delay and can hurt you if you don't retreat. Many creatures can be killed by jumping on their heads. To help performance on slower systems, lo-res graphics are available and the background graphics are optional.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Darkage", "publishers": "Darkage", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaPWAr54_kY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165113-tales-from-heaven\n"}
