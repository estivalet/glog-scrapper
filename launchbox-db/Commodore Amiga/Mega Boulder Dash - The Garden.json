{"altername_name": ["Mega Boulder Dash"], "name": "Mega Boulder Dash: The Garden", "overview": "Here's a Boulderdash/Emerald Mines clone with some differences: the boulders and diamonds don't fall diagonally, and although the colours stay the same, the background graphics change from level to level. Things like tree roots, toxic waste containers, and Pupsi cans are scattered throughout. Game created by Martin Thron and Michael Gerhards and released in 1995. The game consists of 40 stages, and every 4 we get the code so you can continue it later.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Psychotic Productions", "publishers": "Magic Games", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRAE1BsRE3c", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164242-mega-boulder-dash-the-garden\n"}
