{"altername_name": [], "name": "croaker", "overview": "Like Frogger with a twist - the number of lanes increases with each level. Supports two players. Password free by permission of author. This is Croaker by Brian Grier from 1993. You start with your Frog at the bottom of the screen, and your task is to get it into one of the spaces at the top of the screen. While this may sound easy, You have to cross a road, which as levels progress, will get busier, and busier with traffic, making this more and more difficult. When you get to the central part, which you may think is safe, a Snake can sometimes appear and it randomly moves across the screen, which you must avoid, otherwise it will cost you a Frog. Once the central pathway has been passed, it is onto the logs, where you will navigate them without falling into the cold harsh water, which will cost you a life. Then finally on the last log, it is your last jump to freedom, which you must time well, otherwise you will hit your head on the wall, which will cost you a life. There is some pretty nice Croaky Title Screen music, and in-game you have Croaky sounds as your Frog moves around, as well as traffic noises, all the sounds are really nicely done, and are pleasant to listen to.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "September 9, 2022", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Brad Grier", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRkJ8aqQOAQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165472-croaker\n"}
