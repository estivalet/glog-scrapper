{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hydrocis", "overview": "This Shareware brain basher is a very good one for those who love logical puzzles. How do you get 1,000 drops of water to go where you want them to go, with only 4 blockers and 1 blocker remover? This is a bit like Lemmings but the water element means the drops are not controllable. The shareware version stops after level 8, but the full game has 33 levels.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sebastian Winkel", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC7QMD5J09g", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161944-hydrocis\n"}
