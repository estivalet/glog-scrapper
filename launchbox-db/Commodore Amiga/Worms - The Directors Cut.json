{"altername_name": ["Worms: Director's Cut"], "name": "Worms: The Directors Cut", "overview": "Worms: The Director's Cut is a sequel to Worms. Like its predecessor, it is a turn-based artillery game. The game format remains the same: players control small armies of four Worms (whose names can be altered) with the sole purpose of blowing up all the other Worms on the map. Players can compete either against computer-controlled Worms or against each other. The weapons are more extensive (and destructive) than in the previous game, including the first appearances of the Kenny-on-a-Rope, Concrete Donkey, Priceless Ming Vase, Old Woman and Holy Hand Grenade. Also included is a level editor that allows players to create their own battlefields.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Team17 Software", "publishers": "Ocean Software", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "8", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.77", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worms:_The_Director%27s_Cut", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/48580-worms-the-directors-cut\n"}
