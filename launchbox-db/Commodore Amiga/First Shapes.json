{"altername_name": [], "name": "First Shapes", "overview": "Meet Ted E. Bear, a talking computer friend who introduces young children to the world of geometric shapes. Through Ted's helpful spoken messages and encouraging words, children independently use geometric shapes to build toys. Each child has their own Toy Box where the toy maker decides which toys to save, print or delete. Children can accompany Ted to the Toy Fair where they identify special shapes and send Ted flying! In the Make-A-Match Game children match shapes and toys playing by themselves, with Ted E. Bear, or with a friend. Adult helpers can customize First Shapes for each child including setting spoken reward messages, learning modules and speech controls.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "First Byte", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/91358-first-shapes\n"}
