{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bar Games", "overview": "This game consists of a compilation of \u2018Bar Games\u2019. The games include, Liar\u2019s Dice, Wet & Wild, Air Hockey, Pick Up Artist, and Last Call. This game is not for children as there is some sexual content and nudity to some of the games. Liar\u2019s Dice is a game where you bet on how many of a certain number you roll on a dice. Last Call is a game where you have to serve beers to your customers. Air Hockey has you playing this game against a computer opponent. Wet and Wild has you trying to pour water over girls who walk across the screen. Pick Up Artist has you trying to pick up 1 of 3 girls in a bar. In conclusion, I thought this was an interesting game. It\u2019s a novel idea and is executed pretty well. It\u2019s definitely made for a male game player and adults at that. The graphics are decent and the girls in the game are very pretty. I tried using the pickup lines that worked in this game in a real bar and I\u2019m sorry to say that they didn\u2019t work as well in real life. Oh well, maybe next time. If you want to play a game where you pour water over girls and then enjoy a game of air hockey, then get this game. I liked this game, as I say, I thought it was a novel idea and the games do actually play well. An essential purchase? No, not really, but I\u2019m glad its in my software collection.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "ArtisTech Development", "publishers": "Accolade", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsccVcmdm4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/71420-bar-games\n"}
