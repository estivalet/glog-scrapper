{"altername_name": [], "name": "Amos Defence", "overview": "You are the lone defender of the great interplanetary starship AMOS and have to resist a surprise attack from an alien race intent on the destruction of the whole Amos race. Attacking ships are loaded with explosives and try to evade your fire to make kamikaze attacks on your base ship. It is believed they will abandon their attempt if you can destroy 250 of their number, but the more you destroy, the more persistent they become! They will send faster ships and try to target you for explosives instead of the base ship. Look out for rotating mines, if you get too close you'll be cosmic dust.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "K.Barton", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCSOPypLZ_g", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162302-amos-defence\n"}
