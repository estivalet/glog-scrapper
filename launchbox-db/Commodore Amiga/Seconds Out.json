{"altername_name": [], "name": "Seconds Out", "overview": "Seconds Out lets you fight five boxers on your way to being world champion. You see your own boxer in front of you, transparent, so you can see your opponent who you have to beat. Apart from the initial opponent, each one has a special move. You use the joystick, but unleashing head and body blows. You can win due to KO or points. Between the rounds, you play the trainer trying to make your boxer fit again; through joystick-waggling he releases smelling salts and a drink of water.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tynesoft Computer Software", "publishers": "Tynesoft Computer Software", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/108332-seconds-out\n"}
