{"altername_name": [], "name": "Blastaway", "overview": "Blastaway is a fast-paced arena shooter. The game is \"heavily and shamelessly inspired by Wizard of Wor\" with graphics akin to The Chaos Engine. The game contains fifty different arenas across five visually unique stages. To win, you must eliminate the \"wors\" in each arena, without your soldiers being eliminated in turn. After clearing out all the basic wors in an arena, one or more bosses will appear in sequence who will try and rush you, and who must also be defeated before you can continue to the next arena.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "November 12, 2019", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Retream", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/160679-blastaway\n"}
