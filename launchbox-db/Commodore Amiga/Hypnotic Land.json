{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hypnotic Land", "overview": "This action-puzzle game is reminiscent of Klax in both gameplay and perspective, but with balls instead of tiles. The objective is to ensure that colored marbles rolling from the far side are caught in the bins that match their color, if available. To do so, the player can place markers on every other row of the grid, which deviate the course of the ball. Points are gained upon guiding a ball to the matching bin, and lost if the color is wrong. Failing to catch a ball for which there is a matching bin will cost one life. Special multi-colored marbles can be directed to any bin, though missing them still costs a life. The game is organized into levels, each with a set target score. Level progress affects factors such as the rolling speed of the marbles, the number of bins, and the appearance of random monsters which will interfere with player actions but can be shot off the grid.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Lindasoft Electronic", "publishers": "Deja Vu Licenceware", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161645-hypnotic-land\n"}
