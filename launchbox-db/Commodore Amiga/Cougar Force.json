First one is side-scrolling action in different locations such as prison, mines, or temple. For example, you begin in the prison, from where you must escape finding the keys to open doors, fighting the guards with martial arts, avoiding the grenades and lethal obstacles, acquiring the gun, and finally jumping into the plane. Second one is a flight simulator. For example, you have to control a plane, flying over the territory and shooting enemy planes with gun or missiles. Third one is a motorcycle riding. You have to reach the checkpoint for 3:00 before blowing up.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Coktel Vision", "publishers": "Tomahawk", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/89280-cougar-force\n"}
