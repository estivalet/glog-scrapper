{"altername_name": [], "name": "Super Pacman 92", "overview": "Super Pac-Man '92 is an action game that got released by Pendle Europa for the Commodore Amiga in 1992 only in Denmark; as its name suggests, it stars Namco's signature character Pac-Man, and in the spirit of his early official games, the player has to direct him around a two-dimensional maze while avoiding ghosts (but rather than a number of individual ghosts, there are three different types of them: Wanderers, who are green like Funky and easy to avoid, Romers, who are red like Blinky and might chase Pac-Man, and Chasers, who are gray like Spunky and will chase Pac-Man). There is only one type of bonus item that will appear beneath the ghost regenerator, a trio of berries (one blue, one red and one yellow) which is worth a mystery bonus when eaten - and even though Pac-Man will receive an extra life every 10000 points, the game creates the illusion of not having a scoring system, for the player's score is only seen at the start of a round and after finishing one. The mazes, which advance after every even-numbered round, are also too large for the Amiga's monitor, so will scroll according to Pac-Man's location, and when Pac-Man eats a ghost after consuming a power pellet (or \"acid pill\" as the game calls them) to turn them vulnerable, the ghost will still be edible when his eyes return to the regenerator until the power pellet's effect has worn off, except if the pellet's effect wears off first.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Pendle Europa", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2Jv0sFxPw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162774-super-pacman-92\n"}
