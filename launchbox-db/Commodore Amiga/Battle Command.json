{"altername_name": [], "name": "Battle Command", "overview": "Battle Command is a 3D arcade/strategy game, loosely derived from the same developers' Carrier Command. In a near future alternate reality, the Ultra War is fought between the two dominate races in the New World. The 'Mauler' is the latest technology - an Armored Fighting Machine capable of being lifted in and out of hostile territory by a fast Stealth Chopper, and armed with the most advanced weaponry science can devise. You command a single \"Mauler\" assault tank in one of a series of scenarios. These range from a railway ambush to escort duties and a raid on a riverside hideout. Before starting you must choose the right weaponry based on the mission briefing.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Realtime Games Software", "publishers": "Ocean Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.75", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_Command_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTXixaFObuc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73203-battle-command\n"}
