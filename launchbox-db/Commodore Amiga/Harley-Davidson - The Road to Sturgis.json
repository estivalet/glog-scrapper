{"altername_name": [], "name": "Harley-Davidson: The Road to Sturgis", "overview": "Harley-Davidson: The Road to Sturgis is a Racing game, developed by Probe and published by Mindscape International Ltd, which was released for Amiga in 1990. The tiny town of Sturgis, tucked away in the Black Hills of South Dakota, may seem an odd destination for a loud, greasy Hell\u2019s Angel like yourself, but in August Sturgis becomes a Mecca for about 80,000 bikers from all over the world. The actual road section looks okay, but it gets a bit repetitive dodging obstacles in the road, passing cars and stopping hitchhikers. Of course, you can speed things up but it\u2019s a pity there\u2019s no chase, once the cops see you, you automatically pull over for the fine. When you hit town you can have fun customising self and bike at the shop, ogling the digitised petrol pump lady and participating in one of the events. Once you\u2019ve tried all five events, however, there\u2019s little else to see apart from some disappointing single-screen party scenes.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Probe Software", "publishers": "Mindscape International", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.14", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harley_Davidson:_The_Road_to_Sturgis", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgpnOYOfc0U", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/69286-harley-davidson-the-road-to-sturgis\n"}
