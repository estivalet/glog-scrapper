{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pequeno Noah", "overview": "Little Noah (Petit No\u00e9) is not a game strictly speaking, since it cannot be won or lost. In fact, in this work, intentionally Noah does not die. Rather, Little Noah is all of the experiences Noah has had so far. This is the experience of little Noah. Only this. It begins in Mom's womb, in her gestation process. Your own heart is beating. He has nine months to train and mature. Weeks are completed when Noah (the \u201cplayer\u201d) accepts commands that appear on screen (using the joystick up, down, left, or right). But something happens, the bacteria start to appear without Noah being able to do anything to avoid them. At a specific moment, Noah must leave the womb because the infection is not bearable. To do this, you need to press the joystick several times until it is born. Noah starts crying. The game proceeds to a period in the incubator where you learn to breathe and play with objects around you. The game continues throughout several stages of life and updates progress to add more to the game as time passes.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2019", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sensei Sama", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Life Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162501-pequeno-noah\n"}
