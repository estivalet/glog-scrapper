{"altername_name": [], "name": "Star Wars", "overview": "Star Wars is a conversion of Atari Games' first-person shoot 'em up based around the original Star Wars film. You take on the role of Luke Skywalker, aiming to destroy the Death Star - which, as any fan knows, involves attacking the 'weak spot' near the exhaust. To even get to this you have to pass swarms of TIE Fighters. Complete the game and it loops back around at ever-increasing difficulty. The game uses vector graphics, which allow lots of action at high speed on comparatively slow systems.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Vektor Grafix", "publishers": "Br\u00f8derbund Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.1", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_(1983_video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tc-dbyUjjc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/9138-star-wars\n"}
