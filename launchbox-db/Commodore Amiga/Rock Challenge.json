The game screen is laid out much like a Jeopardy board and players take turns at clicking on a square to reveal a multiple choice question. Get it right and you gain points, get it wrong and it's the next players turn. The game ends when at least 3 of the 4 questions in each category have been answered correctly. The questions revolve around Rock music and cover the 1950's-1980's. He who finishes with the most points wins.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Fighting Chance", "publishers": "ReadySoft", "genres": "Quiz", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ni9QAgOnl4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72883-rock-challenge\n"}
