Most of the danger comes from wall mountings or static obstacles rather than actual sentient opposition. The levels are large and multi-directional, with a map feature to help you progress through each one. Power up weapons can be collected. The gameplay is quite systematic, with a measured approach working better than a gung-ho \u2018shoot first, ask questions later\u2019 mentality.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Phil Ruston", "publishers": "F1 Licenceware", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/DfL10u_1ygc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/126517-aquanaut-f1-licenceware\n"}
