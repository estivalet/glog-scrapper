{"altername_name": ["Galaxy Fight", "Galaxy Fight: The Incredible Space Flight"], "name": "Galaxy Fight: The Incredible Space Fight", "overview": "Galaxy Fight: The Incredible Space Fight is a Shooter game, developed by SoftTouch and published by RONO, which was released in Europe in 1987. The art style might be a bit drab, but for a game this early in the life cycle of the Amiga, it is acceptable. The game runs at reasonable speed and features a very short title track. The downsides are: just 5 short levels that loop forever, no power-ups, no bosses, and no in-game music. What is there is competent but it leaves you wanting to play something a bit more fleshed-out and more exciting.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "SoftTouch", "publishers": "RONO GmbH", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbF1b7j6vi8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/67457-galaxy-fight-the-incredible-space-fight\n"}
