{"altername_name": [], "name": "Globdule", "overview": "One of not-nearly-enough games to star an amorphous blob, Globdule sees your character moving around a level by sliding along walls, or jumping off them onto a nearby surface. Each level has a set amount of fruit, all of which must be collected by crossing its path, before reaching the exit. This must all be done within a time limit, and many levels involve collecting keys to unlock doors which are located elsewhere. There are enemies after the first few levels, who must be killed by hitting them, then their eyes must be collected as they wander off. You can withstand 7 hits on each life, but losing a life resets the level.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ex Animo Designs", "publishers": "Psygnosis", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/JSz1hSYSdRw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/71935-globdule\n"}
