{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hard Drivin' II: Drive Harder", "overview": "Hard Drivin' II is a Racing game, developed by Tengen and published by Domark, which was released in 1991. Not to be confused with me coin-op sequel Race Drivin, Hard Drivin II is a revision of the original simulator that\u2019s never appeared in the arcades. At first sight it looks almost exactly the same as HD1. Select the first track from the menu, and you\u2019re plonked into the seat of a Ferrari F40, which actually looks more like a Lada, so you\u2019ll have to use your imagination a bit. The track looks strangely familiar, until you realise that it actually is the same as the original HD1 track. If you still want more tracks, you can design your own with the circuit editor. On the matter of gameplay, it\u2019s indistinguishable from the original game. In other words, it\u2019s very slow running on anything below an A1200, to the point where it becomes frustratingly unresponsive. There isn\u2019t much competition in the car simulation field, but compared to its closest rival, Stunt Car Racer, HDII is far slower, more limited and loses out in the playability stakes by quite a margin. Even so, if you\u2019ve got an accelerated machine, don\u2019t mind putting up with a few bugs; and don\u2019t already have the first game, Hard Drivin II could provide a pleasant distraction for a few hours.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Domark Software", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.1", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2D8ZgNjas0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/69141-hard-drivin-ii-drive-harder\n"}
