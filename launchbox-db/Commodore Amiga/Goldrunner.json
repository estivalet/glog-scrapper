{"altername_name": [], "name": "Goldrunner", "overview": "In Goldrunner, a vertically scrolling shooter, earth has to be evacuated because of the damage caused by environmental pollution. Unfortunately the space ships have to pass through the world of Triton - and the inhabitants are unfriendly. So the obvious solution is to destroy the rings, huge space stations. A full frontal attack is without a change of success because the rings have to be destroyed from within. So the player is chosen to man a small space ship to do the job. The music from the game was done by the legendary Rob Hubbard, and was actually a remix of the first level music from the C64 game, The Human Race (which was also done by Hubbard).", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "MicroDeal Ltd.", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldrunner", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/41102-goldrunner\n"}
