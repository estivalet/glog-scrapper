{"altername_name": [], "name": "Jug", "overview": "You are an interactive humanoid composed of Titanium fleximetal and other organic material, first built in 3642 AD - nicknamed 'JUG' because of your barrel chested profile which can transform into many different shapes and reform instantaneously. The task is simple - This is your 14th Tour of Duty and within the living core of the Planet Spiraeus, is a deadly virus causing its brain to malfunction and all the inner sanctums to die as the life force is diminished. This planet is divided into four zones, each of which has four sectors. Trap doors in the floor and holes in the roof will enable you to move up or down a level. You MUST find and destroy the deadly 'tumor' within the deepest parts of the planet, before it becomes an empty shell drifting in the depths of Space and Time. WARNING! - The planet's immune system will see the Jug as a hostile and alien body so you will be attacked by the defense system of the very planet that you are trying to save! Vital equipment will be transported into the planet along your proposed trajectory to help you in your quest, and fuel pods will be available throughout the game. But take heed, the problems will really start when you have reached the source of the disaster... With bi-directional scrolling, parallax scrolling and the most stunning graphics possible on the ST, you must surely agree that JUG is a game that no one should be without.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Microdeal", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/91776-jug\n"}
