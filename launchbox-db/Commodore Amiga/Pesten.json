{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pesten", "overview": "Pesten is a Dutch card strategy game from Patrick G. Giesbergen that was released in 1995. It may have been a remake\\clone of a 1991 DOS game of the same name. It is known to America and Canada as Uno, with some differences. The object is to get rid of all your cards before the computer opponent can. The game is over when a player has no cards left or if one player has more than 22 cards. Jokers are left in the deck. A Joker can be played at any time except when opponent has just played a 2, it is like a Draw-5 card. There are 3 Jokers in the game deck. You can play a two it is a Draw-2 card equivalent, but if your opponent has a two they can pile it on to make it a Draw-4 back to you! Playing an 8 is like a reverse, play comes back to you.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Patrick Giesbergen", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L8qBK1gBDI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164434-pesten\n"}
