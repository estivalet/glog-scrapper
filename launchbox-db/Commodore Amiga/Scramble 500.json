{"altername_name": [], "name": "Scramble 500", "overview": "A fantastically accurate conversion for the classic Sramble arcade game for the Amiga 500 and above by Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Fabre aka JOTD or jotd666, released as a freeware game in 2022. A two player version was added after the initial release. You play as a spaceship and must fly through tight caves and over landscapes, while being attacked by launched rockets, ufo's and other such nasties without ending up having your ship blown into smithereens. If you can avoid or destroy these hazards and not run out of fuel, you should be able to reach the end stage and destroy the enemy base.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "February 26, 2022", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Fabre (JOTD)", "publishers": "itch.io", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scramble_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XO1ahWov4AY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164894-scramble-500\n"}
