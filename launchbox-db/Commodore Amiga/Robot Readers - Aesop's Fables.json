{"altername_name": [], "name": "Robot Readers: Aesop's Fables", "overview": "The 3 classic fables of The Tortoise and the Hare, The City Mouse and The Country Mouse, and Belling the Cat are presented in this charming early reading program. Beautiful illustrations combine with built-in-word games to hold even a very young child's attention. Early reading skills are enhanced as each story is read and words are highlighted. This interactive program allows children to \"point\" to objects in the illustrations, hear them identified, and see them \"glow\" on the screen. \"Find the Word\" game asks the child to locate a word in the text. When the word is correctly identified it is highlighted and a rewarding \"beep\" is heard. This program's facility to foster early reading skills is combined with a positive computing experience. These classic tales with familiar and meaningful themes make Aesop's Fables a worthwhile addition to a young child's program collection.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Hilton Android", "publishers": "Hilton Android", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "http://hol.abime.net/3775", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/108403-robot-readers-aesops-fables\n"}
