{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Carl Lewis Challenge", "overview": "The Carl Lewis Challenge is a Sports game, developed by Teque London Ltd and published by Psygnosis, which was released in Europe in 1990. He set the previous Olympic Games ablaze with his speed, strength and stamina. This year, he\u2019s lucky to make it to Barcelona. With this in mind, who better to endorse Psygnosis\u2019 forthcoming athletics game than Carl Lewis himself. The actual graphics when throwing the javelin, sprinting, hurdling, long and high jumping, have been designed and recreated from live video footage. This is apparent when you first see the animation as it really is top notch. The Carl Lewis Challenge is a long way from being perfect. Five events just isn\u2019t enough - why can\u2019t we have a modern version of Daley\u2019s Decathlon or Hypersports where there is plenty of varying action? And the management side fails to travel in-depth enough to turn Challenge into a strategy or simulation style of game.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Teque Software", "publishers": "Psygnosis", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/63083-the-carl-lewis-challenge\n"}
