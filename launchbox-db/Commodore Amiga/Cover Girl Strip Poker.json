Well, here you can play with up to three players against one of eight digitized women. Each time you make a girl lose all her money, she takes off some of her clothes (4 of the 8 girls feature \"movies\" of the strip, which consist of half a dozen frames). At the beginning of the game, you may select your language at the beginning and can also choose to turn the girl's comments on or off. Finally, the game features a zoom function with which you can get even bigger pixels.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Emotional Pictures", "publishers": "On-Line Entertainment", "genres": "Casino", "max_players": "3", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.58", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_Girl_Strip_Poker", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/85726-cover-girl-strip-poker\n"}
