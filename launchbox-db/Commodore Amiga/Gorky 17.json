{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gorky 17", "overview": "Mutants have been found in the bombed out Polish city codenamed 'Gorky 17' near Lubin, and a trio of soldiers (Sullivan, Owicz and Trantigne, each of different nationalities) enter the city to find out what happened and find any member of the first squad previously sent there. You control the team and direct them through the world of surprises and mysteries that wait to be resolved. The game features two modes: In the real-time 'exploration' mode, the player controls game characters using a mouse in a point-and-click manner to navigate the player characters through the city as well as interacting with various objects in the game world. Combat takes place in preset encounters located in specific areas of each level map. In the combat mode, the screen is divided into squares with player and computer-controlled characters taking turns trying to eliminate the opposing party. In one turn each game character can move by a certain number of squares and use a weapon once, or decide to take cover instead. Weapons have different tactical effects, for example the pistol can only be fired orthogonally, while the rifle can be fired orthogonally and diagonally. The game ends if any player-controlled character dies.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "October 19, 2015", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hyperion Entertainment", "publishers": "Hyperion Entertainment", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorky_17", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151652-gorky-17\n"}
