{"altername_name": [], "name": "Star Trek (Twisted Images)", "overview": "A really impressive public domain Star Trek (TOS) game by Eric Gustafson, released in 1988 featuring the sounds, music and pictures from the original television series. You control the crew and determine the status of the ship by looking at it from the perspective of each of the control positions of those crewpeople shown. You can click on Dr. McCoy and see the health status of the crew, click on Spock and see the info he has and so forth. Your mission is to recover stolen information which is vital to the security of the whole Federation. All that Star Fleet could tell you is that, \"anywhere from 10 - 15 of these documents are missing\". You have under 5 years to complete your mission. Watch out for Klingon & Gorn spies who are also looking for the same information and be wary of the dangers of Tribbles.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Eric Gustafson", "publishers": "Twisted Images", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RfdhKeTUCk&themeRefresh=1", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/169366-star-trek-twisted-images\n"}
