{"altername_name": [], "name": "Grand National", "overview": "Every aspect of the famous horse race, held over the daunting hurdles course at Aintree in Liverpool every April, is recreated here. Before each race you can place bets on up to five horses, with the odds calculated realistically, even taking betting tax into account. When choosing which horses to back, and which one to actually ride, you must consider the 'going' (what condition the ground surface is in) and which horses are likely to suit your style. Once the race is underway you must direct the horse left and right (weaving across other horses can cause disqualification in the post-race Steward's Enquiry), jump at the right time to clear each hurdle, and crack the whip to speed up the horse. During the race you will be told how many horses are still running, as well as your own position and the identity of the leader.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Elite Systems", "publishers": "Elite Systems", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90709-grand-national\n"}
