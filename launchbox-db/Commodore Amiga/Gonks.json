{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gonks", "overview": "Gonks is a puzzle game starring the Gonks, another stupid species which is only capable of walking forward and turning around when meeting an obstacle. The goal of each level (overall 40) is to lead them to their houses. In later levels there are Gonks of different colours which need to go to the house of the same colour. Each level is divided in two phases. The first one is on a timer and is the main playing phase. Here the player uses blocks and ladders to create a way for the Gonks. Rockets and bombs can be used to destroy obstacles. If the time runs out (or the player has finished the work), the Gonks start to walk and the only thing left to do is hoping that the preparations were correct. A level can be restarted anytime.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Delta-9", "publishers": "F1 Licenceware", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/101810-gonks\n"}
