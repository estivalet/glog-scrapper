{"altername_name": [], "name": "Biing! Sex, Intrigen und Skalpelle", "overview": "Biing! Sex, Intrigue and Scalpels is an erotic hospital-management simulation. You must build a hospital, starting from buying a building for it, then hiring doctors, nurses and receptionists. The game contains typical management simulation elements, albeit with a humorous twist: the doctors are idiots who don't really care for their patients, and the nurses have huge breasts and even do a little striptease from time to time.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "reLINE Software", "publishers": "Magic Bytes", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75327-biing-sex-intrigen-und-skalpelle\n"}
