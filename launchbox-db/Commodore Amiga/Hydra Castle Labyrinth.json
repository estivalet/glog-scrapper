{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hydra Castle Labyrinth", "overview": "Converted from a 2017 homebrew Windows/3DS Japanese game, and has ENG/JAP text options. Very much inspired by Zelda 2. Needs a joypad to get the best from it. Otherwise, pressing S will swipe the sword. Go North and West to find a chest with a Pickaxe. Now you can break open blocks to find keys and items. Push Up to pick up items, open doors, and to use the Save points (blue crystals). Enter doors to fight bosses. Very well polished and put together, and very great music throughout.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2020", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "ArtiGames", "publishers": "", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/368879-hydra-castle-labyrinth\n"}
