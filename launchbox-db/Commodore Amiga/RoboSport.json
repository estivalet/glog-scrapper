You have 5 different types of robots at your disposal, each with it's own weaponry and capabilities. The competition is run in a number of intervals giving you time to reprogram your robots and set them loose to destroy your opponent. This game includes multiplayer options for both multi-computer setups and hot seat play. There is no luck and reflexes are not a factor. Only the one with the best strategy will prevail.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Maxis Software", "publishers": "Ocean Software", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RoboSport", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2muYKIUxQzM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/108400-robosport\n"}
