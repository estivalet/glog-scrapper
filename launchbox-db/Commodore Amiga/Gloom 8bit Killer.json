It plays like early raycasting games such as Catabomb 3D or Wolfenstein 3D, featuring music and aesthetics one may find in an 8bit game for the Nintendo Entertainment System. This is an Amiga port of sorts in the Gloom engine. Textures and some sounds were reused. However, the story screens and the music were removed. Due to engine limitations, none of the original levels were recreated.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2014", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Amigafans", "publishers": "", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165069-gloom-8bit-killer\n"}
