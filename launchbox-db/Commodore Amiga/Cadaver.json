{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cadaver", "overview": "Cadaver is an isometric 3D arcade adventure, played using a joystick and keys. In the person of the thief Karadoc, the player sets out to raid the five stories of the castle Wulf. Legend has it that it\u2019s filled with treasure. What the legend didn\u2019t say is that the Castle is also filled with deadly traps, riddles and monsters. Surviving is not only a question of defending your life. Karadoc needs to explore the murky dungeons and eerie corridors to prove his wit in collecting and interacting with objects, putting them to the right use, mastering spells and solving tasks posed by the gods. Quick reflexes and jumping skill wouldn\u2019t hurt either. The ultimate objective is to kill the necromancer, Dianos. Karadoc's basic skills include the ability to walk, jump, climb stairs and fight monsters. There are three major modes of controlling the dwarf and his actions: basic movement, interacting with objects via icons and the rucksack.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "The Bitmap Brothers", "publishers": "Image Works", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.68", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadaver_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VswPvqWozy4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/23297-cadaver\n"}
