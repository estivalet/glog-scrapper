An organization was formed (EGB-5) which launched a Research & Development station into space. The complex was equipped with the best technology and personnel available. The complex hides a sinister secret in that EGB-5 has struck up a deal with aliens: the aliens provide their advanced knowledge and in return EGB-5 help them obtain samples from Earth - plants, animals, humans - covering up for them when necessary. The deal was an amicable one until EGB-5 discovered the aliens had a secret project: the construction of a cyborg which will be cloned, sent to Earth and used to wipe out the current occupants enabling the aliens to settle there. EGB-5 agree the alien base must be destroyed, but face a problem in that they don't know how to access it. They decide the only solution is to set up a suitable person as an abductee in the hope that when they discover what is going on they will do something about it. They choose Travis Connor: Head of R&D at Sin-Tech, Earth!", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Psyche", "publishers": "Islona", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.31", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/74044-abduction\n"}
