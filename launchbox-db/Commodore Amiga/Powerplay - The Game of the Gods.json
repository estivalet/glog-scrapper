{"altername_name": ["Powerplay: Le Jeu des Dieux", "Powerplay: Das Spiel der Goetter"], "name": "Powerplay: The Game of the Gods", "overview": "Instead of the harmonious strains of pipe music and ambrosial melodies, Mount Olympus is echoing with loud voices, the clash of armour and unmentionable four-letter words. Bored with all this quarreling, Zeus devised a contest to shut them up once and for all. Gods take it in turns to decide on a piece and answer a trivia question. Get it right and you're allowed to move the appropriate character one square in any direction on the multi-coloured board. Try to move on to a square occupied by an opponent piece and you're in for a fight\u2026 well, a challenge really. Lose a challenge and you're demoted a character grade. There's no grade lower than one so if a grade one piece loses a head-to-head it vaporises and disappears from the board. There's just one snag. If you make all your opponents disappear there's going to be nobody left to praise the smartypants. Serves you right, clever clogs! Originally released in 1987 on Amiga, an enhanced version was released in 1988 that featured many enhancements such as improved graphics and animation.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Arcana Software", "publishers": "Arcana Software", "genres": "Quiz", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72690-powerplay-the-game-of-the-gods\n"}
