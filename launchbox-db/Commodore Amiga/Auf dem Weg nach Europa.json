{"altername_name": [], "name": "Auf dem Weg nach Europa", "overview": "Paid by the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, \"Auf dem Weg nach Europa\" or \"On the Way to Europe\" is a german-only multi-genre advergame combining quiz and arcade sections aiming to bring \"Europe closer together\". Your mission is to travel across 12 EU countries, collect souvenirs and return to Brussels. You get the souvenirs on each country by getting the right answers on the trivia sections. Traveling between the countries costs money and you only have 600 ECU's (European Currency Unit, later replaced by its far more famous little brother Euro), so you need to earn more to make it. As luck would have it, you can earn more cash by mastering the action sequences.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Ausw\u00e4rtiges Amt", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "6", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ja3u8H2oZlg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/160329-auf-dem-weg-nach-europa\n"}
