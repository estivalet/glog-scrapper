{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Challenge of the Matrix", "overview": "In The Challenge of the Matrix the player controls a ball in all four cardinal directions on a field consisting of square tiles. The goal is to remove all the tiles by rolling over them. Rolling over empty space should be avoided, because it decreases the ball's energy bar. Once the energy runs out it means the game is over. Later levels introduce obstacles, tiles with special effects and tiles that must be rolled over several times to make them disappear.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Scorpius Software", "publishers": "Scorpius Software", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/145700-the-challenge-of-the-matrix\n"}
