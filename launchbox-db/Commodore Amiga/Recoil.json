{"altername_name": [], "name": "Recoil", "overview": "Conversion from the original ST version: The universe is under attack (again). On EMAR II, home of some rare energy crystals, an alien fleet stopped by. Defence is reduced to a single turret gun named \"Kiss My Ass\". Recoil is a Defender clone. You control the ship and can scroll to both left and right by turning your ship into the desired direction. A huge radar map on the bottom of the screen show enemy activities. In the game, there is a twist on the original scheme: your ship is mounted on some building on the top of the screen and therefore constantly rising back to the top of the screen, which makes control a bit more challenging. The goal is to destroy any moving enemy, while collecting energy and bringing those energy crystals to your base. You have three lives initially and can release a smart bomb as emergency exit.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2019", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Special FX", "publishers": "ZERO (Dennis Publishing)", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVGPv1L8oNY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161428-recoil\n"}
