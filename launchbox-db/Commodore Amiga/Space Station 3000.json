{"altername_name": [], "name": "Space Station 3000", "overview": "Scheduled for release in 1999 by Blittersoft, SPACE STATION 3000 was cancelled in late 2000 after 2.5 years of development for Amiga/PC by developer Digital Images. Space Station 3000 - Features Space Station is a brand new Strategy Game for PC & Amiga which combines Space Combat and Money Management with other, newer, gaming concepts in order to create a Space Trading Experience somewhat different to any other you may have played. The Idea of the Game Your main goals in this game are to build a Space Station that will stand the test of time. And make money. There are numerous other sub-plots to the game but those two are the game's essence. What with things being no fun when they're too easy, we've included many obstacles to prevent you reaching your goals, but I'll introduce you to them later. You start with a small amount of money and a standard, un-expanded Corus Class Space Station and through either hard work, talent and persistence, or underhand tactics and blind luck, you must make a success of your venture.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1999", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Digital Images", "publishers": "Blittersoft", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnWEZE6SIfQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165362-space-station-3000\n"}
