{"altername_name": [], "name": "Xenomorph", "overview": "You have landed your crippled ship at the Atargis mining station. The platform was deserted and no one answered your radio calls. Now you are forced to enter the station and find a way to get off the asteroid. Hopefully whatever happened to the 200 personnel in the labyrinth of mines under the station won't happen to you too. Xenomorph is a first person RPG. Like in the Dungeon Master series, everything happens in real time. You move around in 10 footsteps and can turn 90 degrees. You have two hands to fight and use items with, a belt and holster for quick access to weapons, as well as an inventory for carrying things. The objective of the game is to find parts to repair your ship. You must also find food and water for sustenance and guns, grenades and mines for self defense. Other items can help you during your mission such as environmental suits, security passes and a motion detector. Data disks found throughout the station will fill in the story.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Pandora", "publishers": "Pandora", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenomorph_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/IPrMz1SrAhI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72059-xenomorph\n"}
