{"altername_name": [], "name": "Greenies", "overview": "Greenies is an arena-style fight to the death for up to three players (human or computer). Assume the role of an ogre a troll or a goblin and take apart the other players in an attempt to be the last man standing. The larger characters have more health and muscle power, whilst the smaller characters are faster and can carry more items \u2013 the choice is up to you. The action takes place in a maze filled with all sorts of nasty weapons including grenades, rockets, chainsaws, baseball bats, TNT, mines, rocket launchers and magic potions. There is also a one-player adventure mode in which you go up against computer controlled Greenies as a knight character. In this more puzzle-oriented mode you must find the treasure on 25 different levels and reach the exit alive in order to complete the game.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Habgood", "publishers": "F1 Licenceware", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "3", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qoo5cfW1H_k", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/163890-greenies\n"}
