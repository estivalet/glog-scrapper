{"altername_name": ["Clik-Clak"], "name": "Gear Works", "overview": "This top-down puzzle game starts with a screen featuring a number of red cogs at different parts of the screen, and a grid of pegs (which become less complete on later levels). Your task on each level is to use a number of gears of one of 3 different sizes to ensure that all the cogs are linked together. All this has to be completed before the engine overheats.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Idea Software", "publishers": "Hollyware Entertainment", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/brqpt8gcMQ0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72207-gear-works\n"}
