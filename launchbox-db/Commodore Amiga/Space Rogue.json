{"altername_name": [], "name": "Space Rogue", "overview": "Space Rogue is a hybrid game that combines space flight and combat simulation with trading and RPG elements such as interaction with characters and a quest-based structure with a main plot line. Space flight takes place in two different modes: Cruise Flight, which is ideal for travelling quickly, and Newtonian Flight, which works best for combat and precision flying. There are also three different camera views for the 3D exploration and combat. Each planetary system has a variety of destinations and obstacles to travel through via a top-down navigational map. Traveling to an outpost, a space station, or any other location with the star system can be done simply by selecting it and charting a course, or in real-time 3D flight mode.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Origin Systems", "publishers": "Origin Systems", "genres": "Flight Simulator", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Rogue", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/xtiNWvV4RSU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/71983-space-rogue\n"}
