{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hot Rod", "overview": "Converted from an unassuming coin-op owing a large amount to Atari\u2019s Super Sprint, Hot Rod combines the best in fast cars, hot upgrades and four players. Control of the cars is simple. Hitting fire floors the accelerator and left and right rotates the cars in the appropriate direction. It is this simplicity that makes Hot Rod playable, so there are not any impossible turns. The tracks are uncomplicated and easy to follow, though you need to keep your wits about you. Dotted along the track are bonus icons which give you an extra hundred points and fuel pods. It does not matter what position you finish in as long as you do not run out of fuel. However your tanks will be topped up even further for finish first. The arcade original was pretty simplistic and, as might be expected, the conversion is accurate. Sadly, the arcade machine was not much cop, and that also comes across in the conversion. The graphics and sound are mildly cheering, but the gameplay is thin and watery. Even with four people it palls after a short while. Hot Rod is an accurate but dated conversion which lacks playability.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Software Studios", "publishers": "Activision", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Rod_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpepCYhuhgo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/69529-hot-rod\n"}
