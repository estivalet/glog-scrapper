{"altername_name": ["Plubz 2 Moped"], "name": "Plubz 2: Moped", "overview": "A puzzle game in the style of most others, you've got four areas filled with a random assortment of colored shapes. Each area can carry 4x4 shapes. The middle area is empty, except for your little Moper, which can only move around in the center area. By pressing fire while pointing at a shape, the shape will be sucked into the Moper and pushed into another area. Sort all the shapes by color in vertical or horizontal rows. Pushing one shape into another will destroy them.
