{"altername_name": [], "name": "Arachnophobia", "overview": "This simple action game is based on the Hollywood movie Arachnophobia. South American spiders have overrun a large area in some areas of the United States. It's your task to clean the infested farms, houses or public buildings by using an very effective pesticide called \"Toxi-Max\". One of the most useful devices your character can use is an arachno-detector indicating approaching vermin. The player sprite is controlled from a side-view and basically only needs to use his toxic pesticide in time to defend himself from attacking spiders, just like a simple reaction game.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "BlueSky Software", "publishers": "Walt Disney Computer Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.28", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachnophobia_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFUBkpK0i2A", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/71418-arachnophobia\n"}
