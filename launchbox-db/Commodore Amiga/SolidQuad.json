{"altername_name": [], "name": "SolidQuad", "overview": "A fast driving game where you blast through the countryside, splashing through rivers and puddles and jumping ditches and lava flows on 3 courses. Careen through puddles to extinguish any on board fires the lava may have caused. Press fire and pull back to get the most out of the jumps. Avoid pedestrians and hit the ramps when possible to jump ditches. Each course does seem to come with a mid-level boss where you can shoot the scarecrow heads you avoided in previous parts of the game at the boss. Some of what you need to do to be most successful is intended as a puzzle to be figured out according to the creator, J. Richard Evans who released this game to the public domain in 1992. The game and color palette heavily inspired by old Spectrum games.If you want more info just read the German or English versions of the readme.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "J.
