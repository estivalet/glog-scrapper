{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hundir la Flota", "overview": "The game is the old and well-known boat game, where we can face the computer or another player. Our mission is to locate all the adversary's ships and destroy them before he succeeds. We have three shots, but every time we manage to hit the position of one of the enemy ships, we will have an extra shot. At the beginning of the game, we will place the ships on the game board horizontally, vertically or diagonally, knowing that it is not allowed to place one ship next to another, that is, there must always be at least one free square between ship and ship. There are 4-piece ships, 3-piece ships, 2-piece ships, and 1-piece Submarines.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "MA Soft", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/163948-hundir-la-flota\n"}
