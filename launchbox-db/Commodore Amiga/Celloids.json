The two player mode can be used by a single player too by using a controller and keyboard simultaneously which gives more control to the aiming process. The game was released to the public in the beginning of 2018 by Avesoft founder Jyrki Kummola at the birthday party of the Finnish game museum where the finnish game/digital media preservation group Kasettilamerit was present. Both Jyrki Kummola and the makers of the game have given their permission that it can now be freely distributed.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Vili Jussila", "publishers": "Avesoft", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/368700-celloids\n"}
