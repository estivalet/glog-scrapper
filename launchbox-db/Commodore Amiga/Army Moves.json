{"altername_name": [], "name": "Army Moves", "overview": "Your careers officer in school really had a hard time finding you a job. Just saying 'I wanna be an 'ard man!' wasn't exactly helpful. Still, now you're in the Special Operations Corps (SOC), you've been sent on a well dangerous mission to steal information from the enemy. You must fight your way over a bridge in your jeep, through air defences in your helicopter and finally, on foot into the headquarters themselves proclaiming yourself a hero! OK, OK and a 'well 'ard geezer' if that's what you want... The level of gameplay in Army Moves is so minimal that it annoys me to think that people may have paid out big bucks just so that they can practise holding down the fire button and religiously going through two joystick movement patterns. The slightest deviation from the stringent stick manoeuvring results in instant death, and return a trip to the start of the level! So if, after ten minutes' play, you haven't vengefully put the disk under the grill and watched it bubble its way into oblivion, you'll be slumped over your joystick dreaming of happier times. I regret the loss to the world's natural resources caused by the production of this utterly awful 'game'.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dinamic Software", "publishers": "Imagine", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.62", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_Moves", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JextFk8j-Vg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/74535-army-moves\n"}
