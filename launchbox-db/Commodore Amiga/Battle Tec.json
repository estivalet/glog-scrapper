{"altername_name": [], "name": "Battle Tec", "overview": "Battle Tec is a puzzle game where your goal is to make all the buttons on the board turn red. There are five colors in total. When you click one, the neighboring buttons will also change their color in a sequential order visible on the top of the screen. As a surprising game mechanism there's no time limit; instead it's replaced by a WWI fighter flying around, coming towards your mouse cursor at all times. If it catches you it's game over; if you manage to turn all the buttons the right color before that, the fighter explodes and on to the next level you go.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "August 7, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Logistic Dreams", "publishers": "Amiga Special", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/160932-battle-tec\n"}
