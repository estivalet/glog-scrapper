{"altername_name": [], "name": "DropZone", "overview": "DropZone is based on Archer Maclean's classic C64 Defender-style shoot-em-up 'n' save-the-men. I found that it was the one thing I really pined for when my C64 died, and when I couldn't find any versions for the Amiga I was driven to learn a language and write my own. It took around two years (sometime in the mid-nineties) to complete, including distractions and hardware breakdowns (and nervous breakdowns and snack breaks). And now it seems to be the only thing I use the Amiga for, when I want a good, sweeping, hyperactive nostalgia-fest. Which is pretty much the reason I wrote it.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Richard Tunstall", "publishers": "Richard Tunstall", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQa8NmWIee8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162281-dropzone\n"}
