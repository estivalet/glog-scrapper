{"altername_name": ["The AmyPutt Classics"], "name": "The Amy Putt Classics", "overview": "The Amy Putt Classics is an 18-hole mini-golf course game for 1 to 4 players. You hit the ball by clicking the mouse in the direction that you want the ball to go, relative to where it currently is, using the distance from ball to the mouse cursor to indicate how hard to hit it. Hazards include sand traps, tunnels and tubes, running water, and a windmill where you have to get the timing right to knock the ball between the spinning blades. The view is top-down, and contours in the course are represented using shades of color: the lowest parts are dark green, gradually changing to a lighter green to indicate an upward incline.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Charles Carter", "publishers": "DigiTek, Inc", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/74401-the-amy-putt-classics\n"}
