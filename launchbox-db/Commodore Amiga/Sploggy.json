{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sploggy", "overview": "Far, far off in the distant extremities of the universe lies a little planet much like our own. On this planet lived a happy family of tiny red squashy blobs. The Sploggys! They lived an idyllic world and soon it would be time for the great festival of dancing, singing and games. But the evil planet snatcher would use the festival for his own gain, by placing helium filled balloons to float the planet and all the merry folk off into the cold of deep space. The evil lord learned of what the Sploggy family had discovered and took the parents, leaving the sploglings behind. Can the little ones fix the problems, will the Sploggy adults intervene to stop what might appear to be mischief? A PD demo version and a full Shareware version of this game are available.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "J.
