{"altername_name": [], "name": "Simulman 3: Nel Regno Di Doors", "overview": "Simulman 3: Nel Regno Di Doors is an Action Adventure game, developed and published by Simulmondo, which was released in Europe in 1993. The young simulhero (virtual hero, simulated hero, interactive hero ...) should pull himself out of trouble for good thanks to his intelligence and the help of Cactus. The black giant, he looks like Jabbar the legendary Los Angeles Lakers, will not play a completely secondary role in this story and, even if this time he does not enter the DOORS with Simulman, he is his guide and navigator and keeps the channels open to him with the outside world. This time you will say-rightly experience what the realm of DOORS is! Meanwhile things are also maturing in the city and S-DOS is likely to lead to happily ends to his rebellious plan. For a pirated operating system, the bad guy is not doing badly. And indeed it seems entirely intentional so that he may complete the work. He did, of course, the bill without ours tens of thousands of interactive hosts, all of you, who without time in between, they will make the choices that need to be made until Simulman's final victory.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Simulmondo", "publishers": "Simulmondo", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS1VT8y_BYA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/131488-simulman-3-nel-regno-di-doors\n"}
