Whenever a tile is touching another of the same colour, those tiles become linked (think in terms of how a country forms an alliance with another), and you must activate them all to see any difference. The game rewards successful completion of levels by offering spells, ranging from faster movement to position swapping to 'confuse' sells which change the colour the squares appear in. These are selected form a drop-down menu using the mouse.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Mark of the unicorn", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/163977-hex\n"}
