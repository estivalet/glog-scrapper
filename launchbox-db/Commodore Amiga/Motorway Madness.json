{"altername_name": [], "name": "Motorway Madness", "overview": "Motorway Madness is THE game to play at parties. This game is a four player racing/shoot-em-up with a decidedly viscous streak. The objective is simple: eliminate all the opposition. The methods vary: dual forward firing machine guns, long range missiles or a large brutal ram strapped to the front of your car. However, remember that every car you eliminate this round will be out to get you in the next!", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Michael J.
