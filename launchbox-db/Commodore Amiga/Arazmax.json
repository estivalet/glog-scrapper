{"altername_name": [], "name": "Arazmax", "overview": "Arazmax is an Shooter game, developed and published by Mark Sheeky of Scorpius Software, which was released in Europe in 1992. You have been challenged to complete 40 progressively harder levels of the arena. To complete each level you must destroy all multiplication drones and all shootable mines. Multiplication drones will multiply when a specific time limit has elapsed. Other objects can appear in the mazes too... Coloured spots in white circles are pickups, shoot to obtain. Blue pickups are smart bombs, yellow pickups are extra energy, red pickups are shot speed and green pickups are points. Energy is lost when you touch enemy mines or multipliers. When your energy hits zero, you die! To fire smart bomb, hold fire. Watch out for invisible walls and indestructible mines.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Scorpius Software", "publishers": "Scorpius Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.62", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/61654-arazmax\n"}
