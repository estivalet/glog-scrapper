{"altername_name": [], "name": "Turrican II: The Final Fight", "overview": "Turrican II: The Final Fight is a platformer/shooter as typically seen on consoles, but designed for home computers from the ground up. Its plot is - naturally - very simple: an evil mega-robot called The Machine attacks the United Planets Ship Avalon 1, slaughtering all who resist. All - except Bren McGuire, who manages to escape and slips into the experimental Turrican bionic armor. As Turrican, he strives to show The Machine who's the boss. Unlike other games of its type, this game contains three levels of horizontal shooter action in the spirit of R-Type or the developers' own Katakis. Six large worlds are to be explored, where you are basically free to go everywhere you want, since there is no automatic scrolling and the levels are packed with hidden extra lives and weapons. All those levels are very different: the first one in the rock desert is pretty colorful with parallaxing rainbow background and happy music, while the following worlds get darker and darker.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Factor 5", "publishers": "Rainbow Arts", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.43", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turrican_II:_The_Final_Fight", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UW4CDWyhxLw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/9147-turrican-ii-the-final-fight\n"}
