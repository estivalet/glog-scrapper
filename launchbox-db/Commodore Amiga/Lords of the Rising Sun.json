After your father has been murdered, you set out on a quest to become Shogun to restore the honor of your family. You'll have to defeat all your enemies - including your brother. Most of the time, you'll move your troops through the big map of Japan - as soon as something happens, you'll have to fight your enemies in action sequences, such as a Gauntlet-like fortress attack or defending against a Ninja assassin. If two troops collide, a battle might ensue in which you'll have to use all your strategical wits to guide your men to victory.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Cinemaware", "publishers": "Cinemaware", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lords_of_the_Rising_Sun", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NJPCYZX_3U", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/62005-lords-of-the-rising-sun\n"}
