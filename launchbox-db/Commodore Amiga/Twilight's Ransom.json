{"altername_name": [], "name": "Twilight's Ransom", "overview": "Paragon Software, maker of the Twilight series of strategy games, takes a diversion in this surprisingly well-written IF set in the Twilight universe. Suddenly discovering that your girlfriend has been kidnapped, you must deal with the kidnappers who have more sinister plans, rescue your girlfriend and-- of course-- save the world as we know it. Although the game's parser is not up to par with Infocom's, interesting gadget-oriented puzzles and well-written gameworld more than make up for the deficiency. There are also enough plot twists along the way to keep mystery fans happy. All in all, a commendable and refreshing effort. HINT: Type 'picture' or 'P' to display graphics for a particular location in the game. Not all locations, however, have graphics.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Paragon", "publishers": "Paragon", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73879-twilights-ransom\n"}
