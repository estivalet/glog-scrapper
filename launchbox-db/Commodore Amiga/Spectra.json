{"altername_name": [], "name": "Spectra", "overview": "The idea of Spectra is to change the coloured circles on the left of the screen to match those on the right of the screen. Simple as that...or is it? You begin with 3 lives and each level has a strict time limit. When you click on the left mouse button on a circle it changes the colour of the circle you click on through two colours in a range, and all adjacent circles move on just one colour in the range. The range of the colours are: Red, Green, Blue, Magenta, Yellow. The faster you complete the level, the greater the number of points you will recieve.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Amivision", "publishers": "", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_NIFelTl58", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162609-spectra\n"}
