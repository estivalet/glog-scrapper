{"altername_name": [], "name": "Super Skweek", "overview": "Super Skweek is a game inspired by the wide success of Chip's Challenge, and shares some elements of that puzzler while combining other elements from games such as Pengo. In Super Skweek, you play the title character who must walk around and either paint all the tiles of the game board pink, complete a specific mission, or both. Some tiles react in various ways when you walk on them, like exploding. Unlike Chip's Challenge, the game plays in realtime and you can pick up and use weapons to keep away certain monsters as you paint the tiles. There is also a shop you can enter to purchase items. Finally, levels have a time limit for completion.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Loriciel", "publishers": "Loriciel", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDE77Z494JU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109888-super-skweek\n"}
