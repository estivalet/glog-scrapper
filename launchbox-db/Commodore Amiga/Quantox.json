{"altername_name": [], "name": "Quantox", "overview": "Quantox actually turned out to be rather good. The game is a dead simple shoot 'em up game with Jeff Minter overtones, but it's fast, smooth, slick and pretty, and it kept me entranced for ages. Lots of little bonus games stop it from getting repetitive, and even the power-ups have a touch of imagination about them. In fact, I'd go so far as to say that this is one of the most original blasters I've seen in a long time (in 1988). This has to represent, then, something of a major bargain.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Paul Tuck", "publishers": "Anco Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKuiZFp5Ufg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72833-quantox\n"}
