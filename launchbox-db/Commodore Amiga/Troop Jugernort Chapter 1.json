{"altername_name": [], "name": "Troop Jugernort Chapter 1", "overview": "A single player beat-em up game by Paul Weller and published by Sunteam in 1992. There is a legend that states that during a time of great unrest, a child will be hatched from a great egg. This child will start his life free, with abilities beyond the understanding of men. The child shall be gifted with the power of goodness from the beginning, and will bring peace throughout the land. However, not all legends go according to plan... During the night the child was given to the world, a great battle between the dragon spirits of Good and Evil was taking place. Lightning lanced over the land and mountains crumbled to dust as the two ghostly figures fought for the possession of the baby. While the Good dragon spirit gave the enemy a fatal blow, the Evil dragon spirit swallowed up the egg and vanished. But a powerful monk found the tiny bruised baby alive. Sensing the presence of evil all around the child he enclosed him in many containment spells, slowing the child's growth to a virtual stop and then sealed the body into an air-tight coffin and threw it into the seas. That was many, many years ago, and that is where our tale begins.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Paul Weller", "publishers": "Sunteam", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kgq5u7MsE0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162122-troop-jugernort-chapter-1\n"}
