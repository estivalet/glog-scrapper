{"altername_name": [], "name": "Super Sprint", "overview": "A reverse engineered modification by Philippe Guichardon (Meynaf). Based on 1986 Atari Games coin-op; Amiga version ported from 1986 State of the Art/Electric Dreams Atari ST release. Like the original ST version, Super Sprint is a racing game for one or two players. Gameplay is from an overhead view of the racetrack. The racetracks start simple and gradually get more complicated, and may also feature obstacles ranging from traffic cones to tornadoes. Occasionally wrenches will appear in the roadway, and when collected they can be used after a race to power up your car with better tires, better acceleration or a higher top speed.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2012", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "State of the Art", "publishers": "", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164948-super-sprint\n"}
