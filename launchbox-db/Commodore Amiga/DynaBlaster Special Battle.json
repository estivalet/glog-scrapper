{"altername_name": [], "name": "DynaBlaster Special Battle", "overview": "To say it is a Bomberman clone is to take away from this fun game. yna Blaster is a formidable little gem, very polished and well balanced. The Amiga version is a direct port of the NEC PC-Engine original. It has virtually the same graphics, the same sound scheme and, most of all, the same utterly great playability. A similar port exists also for the PC, the Atari ST and the Sharp X68000. The first two are inferior to the Amiga version especially in the sound department, while the latter is identical in every form. In the PC-Engine and the X68000 the game is known as Bomberman. In the Amiga, the ST and the PC, the game is know as Dyna Blaster. The NES version may be heralded as holding the true crown for first Bomberman game, but the PC Engine version, the one that the Amiga and X6800 descend from is the one that made it truly great.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1997", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "FX Casseron", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daA-XTU8k1k", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162485-dynablaster-special-battle\n"}
