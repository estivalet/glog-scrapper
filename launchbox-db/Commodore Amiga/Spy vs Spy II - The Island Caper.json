{"altername_name": ["Spy vs Spy 2: The Island Caper"], "name": "Spy vs Spy II: The Island Caper", "overview": "A follow-up to the first Spy vs Spy game now sees the spies stranded on a desert island. This time, instead of the four items which allow you to leave for the airport, the spies must try to collect three pieces of a missile and escape from the island in a waiting submarine before a volcano erupts. There are a few pitfalls to avoid such as quicksand and sharks. There are also new traps (hidden pits, napalm, snares and a pistol) and hand-to-hand combat is done with swords instead of clubs.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "First Star Software", "publishers": "Wicked Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/43515-spy-vs-spy-ii-the-island-caper\n"}
