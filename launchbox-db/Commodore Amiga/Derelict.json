{"altername_name": ["Sub Mare Imperium: Derelict"], "name": "Derelict", "overview": "A first person exploration game. This is a slow game, so take your time. Find and interact with objects and simply figure things out. Sure, this is not a fully original idea but rather a game I've been trying to make since I was a teenager in one way or another. This time, I have reframed the whole story and character motivation, as well as the puzzles. The level geometry was entirely redone as well, but still bears some vague resemblance with the original concept.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2021", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "MontyOnTheRun", "publishers": "", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/169380-derelict\n"}
