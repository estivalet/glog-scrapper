{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hillsea Lido", "overview": "Hillsea Lido puts you in charge of seaside amusement facilities loosely based around a beach near Vulcan's Hampshire base. Each of the sites is rented out to various small businesses, in return for a cut of their profits. You can put various events on, and must advertise them locally. The area must be kept clean and tidy by hiring, and facilities and food available. The game's structure is day-by-day, with different tasks and opportunities on each of them - this is the only major difference from Bullfrog's Theme Park.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Vulcan Software", "publishers": "Vulcan Software", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73807-hillsea-lido\n"}
