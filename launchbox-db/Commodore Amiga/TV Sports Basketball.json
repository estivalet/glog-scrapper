{"altername_name": [], "name": "TV Sports Basketball", "overview": "Basketball was the second sport to which Cinemaware applied their philosophy of lavish production and advanced cutscenes. Exhibition and league matches are on offer, with the opportunity to recreate a full league season with 1 player assigned to each of the 28 clubs. The game uses varying camera positions, with top-down views when the ball is close to either hoop, and a side-view when the ball is mid-court - controls remain unchanged for these, so the switch doesn't cause a sudden change in player movement. As well as playing the matches you have full coaching control. This can involve making substitutions but also assigning marking and game strategies.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Cinemaware", "publishers": "Cinemaware", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_Sports_Basketball", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/44973-tv-sports-basketball\n"}
