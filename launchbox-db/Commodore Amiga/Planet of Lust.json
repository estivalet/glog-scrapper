This is still accomplished through a text parser, feeling your way around the world by scrutinizing brief descriptions and static, non-interactive screens colourfully illustrating available exits and the objects of your interest and desire.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Free Spirit Software", "publishers": "Free Spirit Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/127872-planet-of-lust\n"}
