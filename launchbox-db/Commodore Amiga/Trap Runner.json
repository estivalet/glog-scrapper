{"altername_name": [], "name": "Trap Runner", "overview": "Trap Runner is a classic platform game with few twists. Mind traps, obstacles and monsters. Beside the genre-typical jumping and running action you can cower yourself to avoid contact with low flying monsters. In later levels magic pills will help your task to save May. Collect potions to fill transparent ghost tiles with colour to make them solid. Other pills will change your own skin colour, allowing you to pass tiles with the exactly same colour. Collect items to increase your score, gain extra lives or fulfil one of the special missions. Two of four levels a world have a mission to accomplish.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2018", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Night Owl Design", "publishers": "RetroGuru", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/1wUDTTE5tgg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/155645-trap-runner\n"}
