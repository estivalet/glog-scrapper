{"altername_name": ["Xhyperoid 1.2"], "name": "Xhyperoid", "overview": "An AmigaOS4 port from the Windows 3.1 original game. Hyperoid was a really cool little game for Windows 3.x. It's essentially an Asteroids clone, but with a few extra features. There are three reasons I ported it as XHyperoid: - the decent game physics and enhancements over the original game make it probably my favorite Asteroids variant; - it's always sucked having to run it under Windows (admittedly, you can run the original under Wine, but it's less than ideal); - it's the first GPL'd program I ever saw, which gives it a certain special something for me. :-) One of the first things I did on porting it was to add sound, so that's another plus. :-)", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2007", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Edward Hutchins", "publishers": "", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/167105-xhyperoid\n"}
