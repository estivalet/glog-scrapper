{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mau Mau", "overview": "A three player card game created by Harald M\u00fcller (Mueller) and published in Gamer's Delight, Gamer's Delight 2 and in Schatztruhe #1209. Mau-Mau is a member of the larger Crazy Eights or shedding family, to which the proprietary card game Uno belongs. However Mau-Mau is played with standard French or German-suited playing cards. The game is typically played with a 32-card pack, either a French-suited pack from which the Twos, Threes, Fours, Fives and Sixes have been removed or, especially in Europe, with a 32-card German pack. For more than 5 players, 2 packs of cards may be used. The aim is to be first to get rid of all of one's cards. Most of the time, the winner will have to say something at this point, usually \"Mau\". If they fail to say this, they do not win and instead must take penalty cards. If a player's last card is a Jack, they must reply differently, usually saying \"Mau Mau\".", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Harald M\u00fcller", "publishers": "Intersoft", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "3", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164227-mau-mau\n"}
