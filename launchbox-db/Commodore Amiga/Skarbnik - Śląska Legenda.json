The goal of the game is to solve the mystery of the strange events in the Silesian mines. The adventure begins when one of the sidewalks collapsed trapping the player in an old unknown mine shaft. By using the artifacts scattered in the mine the player must find a way out and documents explaining the current events. Besides of solving the puzzles the player will face several enemies, such as a robot with laser eyes, guard with the machine gun or dangerous rats. The enemies may be defeated by using the appropriate items - lack of the items or too late usage may result in loss of energy or death. The player may carry up to four items at a time. The game features a lot of useless objects. Once combined items can't be disconnected, thrown objects disappear forever. The game is presented in first person perspective, with rendered animated graphics. The control is done with the mouse by using the direction arrows or one of the action icons (take, leave, combine, open, close).", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atares", "publishers": "Atares", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5v0XQ6IAhI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165243-skarbnik-slaska-legenda\n"}
