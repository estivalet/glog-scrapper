{"altername_name": [], "name": "Reel Fish'n", "overview": "Reel Fish'n is a fishing simulator. Starting small in a rented boat with a plastic worm, a spinner, or other tackle, you can work your way to tournament status, purchasing not only additional tackle, but also equipment such as depth finders and serious bass boats. The player takes over a character's life, balancing business and fishing. Game elements include examining the weather forecast and deciding where to fish. Regular work needs to be done to provide money for the fishing hobby, or tournaments can be entered for financial support when they are won. Once a fish has been caught, it needs to be managed carefully to reel it in.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Doug Gerecht", "publishers": "Interstel", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164945-reel-fishn\n"}
