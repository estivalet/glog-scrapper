{"altername_name": ["Billiards Simulator II"], "name": "Billiards II Simulator", "overview": "With a table in the majority of good pubs pool is a very popular game. It's quick and doesn't keep you tied lo the table for over an hour like snooker can, and a lot easier due to the size of the balls and table. But this is Billiards II I hear you say! Well, in this game as well as getting two billiards games to try your hand at, there's also two pool games (numbered and normal league pool) and two Q-ball variations. Each game puts you on the end of the cue, and it's your choice to whether you play from an overhead or solid 3-D view of the table. Ball control is also available by selecting where you cue the white. Rest assured either way will prove a challenge with only the most skillful players potting the balls.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Infogrames Europe SA", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/74943-billiards-ii-simulator\n"}
