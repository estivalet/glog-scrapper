{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dirty Rackets", "overview": "Dirty Rackets is a game of the shareware scene, which is a remodelled (and expanded) version of the classic Atari Pong. Now you can play tennis (singles and doubles), soccer and \"front\u00f3n\". The game modes available are the usual for this kind of game (single match and championship), although this time there's also the option of a points league. Game settings are varied too, you can make your racket bigger or faster, choose to play for the points or against time, or 1 vs 1 and 2 vs 2 players. For the nostalgics, there's also an option to play the classic black-and-white Pong.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Pyramid", "publishers": "CLR Licenseware", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161643-dirty-rackets\n"}
