{"altername_name": [], "name": "BattleStar", "overview": "BattleStar is a fun text-based adventure game, reminiscent of Zork and Adventure. You start out on a space ship under attack and must get off and back to the planet. It was originally written for mainframes back in 1979 and later ported to most platforms, including Amiga. Battlestar is described as a 'stellar-tropical adventure game' in the source code header. You initially find yourself in in a battlestar that is under attack and must make your escape. However, there are many useful items in the battlestar that you may need before you escape, but only so many turns before it explodes. Battlestar is interesting among text adventures in that it tracks the current player orientation and updates the directions based on the current facing. For example, entering the room on the 'right', would result in a direction of 'behind' for leaving the room again. Re-entering the room would then be 'behind' when back in the corridor. Absolute directions (N,S,E,W) are possible, but only when a compass is found.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "June 23, 1990", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "David Ingebretsen", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161209-battlestar\n"}
