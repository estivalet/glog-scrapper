The game recreates the situations at 3 dates in the attack, and you can play any of those from either side. You have a range of units under your command, as although the battle was largely tank-based there were also infantry and air units involved. Units can be told which positions to take up, and whether to defend a spot or consciously aim to attack it. The game's AI incorporates the significance of bridges, rivers and forests as strategic points, and your units can be subject to fatigue.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Panther Games", "publishers": "Panther Games", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/94236-fire-brigade-the-battle-for-kiev-1943\n"}
