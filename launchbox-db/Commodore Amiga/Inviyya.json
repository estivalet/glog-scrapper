{"altername_name": [], "name": "Inviyya", "overview": "Inviyya is a 2021 horizontal SHMUP for the line of classic Commodore Amiga computers, Inviyya features 6 unique organic levels each with its own enemies and bosses, couple of weapon upgrades, 3 layer parallax scrolling and nice music and sfx. Should work on every existing Amiga with at least 512k Chip and any other form of 512kb extra RAM (chip, slow or fast), PAL or NTSC ( for NTSC I recommend some slight acceleration above standard 7mhz 68K. Game is extremely playable as it is on these systems, but it will look smoother in some rare situations with lots of enemies on screen with a bit extra accelerator oomph).", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "April 11, 2021", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tigerskunk", "publishers": "itch.io", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZ_8oXVo20I", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151045-inviyya\n"}
