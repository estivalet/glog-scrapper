{"altername_name": [], "name": "King's Quest: Quest for the Crown", "overview": "Sir Graham is a brave knight who is sent on a quest to retrieve three treasures that were stolen by deception and stealth: a shield that protects its bearer from invaders, a mirror that foretells the future, and a treasure chest that is forever filled with gold. If Graham takes these treasures back to the royal castle, then the ailing King Edward the Benevolent of Daventry will hand over the crown. During his travels, Graham will meet characters that will either help or hinder him. King's Quest is commonly considered the progenitor of third-person-perspective adventure games. As opposed to earlier graphic adventures, the player is able to navigate the protagonist on screen in eight directions, creating an effect of three-dimensional exploration. The player character can also be obscured from view when hiding behind an object, is subjected to gravity, and has different animations for actions such as picking up an item, falling, swimming, etc. Graham can be moved around with arrow keys and perform various actions when the player types commands, normally consisting of noun and verb combinations (e.g. \"Take flower\", \"Talk man\", etc.).", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Sierra", "publishers": "Sierra", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.83", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Quest_I", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40952-kings-quest-quest-for-the-crown\n"}
