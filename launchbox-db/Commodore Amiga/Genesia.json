{"altername_name": [], "name": "Genesia", "overview": "The game has an isometric view point, and allows you to watch as your people work, play, and suffer, in real time. You must build up your kingdoms infrastructure, grow food, mine minerals, produce building materials, conduct research, and create armies. You may engage in diplomacy with your neighbors, but eventually conquest will become essential for expansion. There is an underlying sub-plot that must be achieved as well, there are nine magical jewels scattered around the land, and you must retrieve at least seven of them to be victorious.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Micro\u00efds", "publishers": "Mindscape International", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Domain", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/-HcA7kYXInU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/71934-genesia\n"}
