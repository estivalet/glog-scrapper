{"altername_name": ["Charly", "Charly"], "name": "Charlie", "overview": "Charly is a Soko-Ban variant. In each top-down level, the player has to push crates on especially marked fields. However, there is one important difference to the original: crates can also be pulled. In turn there is a limitation of moves in place. One move equals pulling or pushing a crate one field. There are also cracked tiles which cause a life loss when stepping on them and randomly appearing power ups.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Interactive Designs", "publishers": "Magic Soft", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/88916-charlie\n"}
