{"altername_name": [], "name": "Snake Pit", "overview": "Snake Pit is a Snake game in the style of Nibbler where the player has to guide his munching reptile through a maze full of food pellets. The aim is to eat all the pellets and then one or several exits will open up. The problem is that the snake body grows with every eaten pellet which makes it harder to find a path through the labyrinths without colliding with own body which leads to a lost life. A difference from other Snake games is that touching walls does not lead to death. Instead the player loses points and after a short while the snake will randomly choose a new direction to move in. In addition to normal pellets there are also those that shrink the snake when eaten. There are also special walls that can be pushed around by the snake as long as there is nothing on the opposite side of it. The game has fifty levels and it's possible to start them in any order without completing the previous ones. Also included is a built in editor that allows the player to edit the levels. The editor works similar to a paint program with the player drawing walls and pellets on the screen.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "MKSoft", "publishers": "Incognito Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsNT0YCtQo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164624-snake-pit\n"}
