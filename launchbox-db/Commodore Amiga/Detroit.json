{"altername_name": ["R\u00fcsselsheim"], "name": "Detroit", "overview": "Detroit puts you in the year 1908, and you are the President of an upstart car company. You will build and design cutting-edge automobiles, take care of finances and promote your products with marketing campaigns. Vintage car lovers will really enjoy the game, as it includes many classic car designs, all of which you can modify to your heart's content. As time goes by, new technologies will become available, and the industry will evolve with faster and safer cars. Competition, of course, will become tougher as your competitors catch up to your technological advantages. You must then think globally -- open new factories overseas, and think of how to segment your market with different car models that do not cannibalize each other's sales.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Impressions Games", "publishers": "Impressions Games", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.44", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/74054-detroit\n"}
