{"altername_name": [], "name": "Battle Cars II", "overview": "This game is the sequel to \u201cBattle Cars\u201d, the public domain game released in 1991. For either one or two players, the game is played inside one of four 800m by 800m arenas with the two cars starting at opposite ends. The aim is simply to destroy your opponent's car, which is done by breaching the armour on one side of his (or her) car. To help you in your task, your car is equipped with a 30mm cannon, radar guided missiles and (in the two player game) a set of ram-plates. In the one player game you play against a computer driven car. You can't crash into the computer car and it can't fire back at you. Sound a bit easy? Not when you realize that you have a time limit of three minutes in which to win, otherwise the computer automatically wins.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "", "developers": "David Jameson", "publishers": "David Jameson", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/74918-battle-cars-ii\n"}
