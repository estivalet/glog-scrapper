{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Moochies", "overview": "The Moochies is an Amiga puzzle arcade game released in 1991 by Breadline. Have you ever heard of some little creatures known to man in the dawn of ages as the Moochies? These little creatures and the land in which they dwell has been turned into a fable as time passed by, just like pixies, trolls and their kind was. The leader and advisor of the Moochies, Mesmeth, is a fair and reasonable leader, loved and cherished by all of his people. He is the last practicing magician, but there are still many magicians among the little people - some of whom were present when the prophecies about man's future was spoken - but they're all getting so old and senile that even the most elementary formulas and predictions is becoming impossible for them. They pass the day by conjuring up weird and strange apparitions, chat with them for awhile and then forget all about them, speaking useless predictions nobody could care less about and generally making a nuisance of themselves. Mesmeth has a lot of trouble sending all the offended apparitions back to their own planes of existence, since the other magicians don't know how any longer. If Mesmeth hadn't been so busy looking after the old magicians, he would probably have discovered it early enough to take appropiate action against it. He would have noticed how the milk was becoming poorer. How the eggs were scarcer. How the grass was less colourful. How the children cried in the long, dark nights. He would have noticed how Evil had seeped into The Forgotten Land.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Breadline", "publishers": "Breadline", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/99yTKik1sGk?t=7", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109661-the-moochies\n"}
