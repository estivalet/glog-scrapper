The vast gameworld, very few clues, and numerous objects you can use (including neat spy gadgets) make this a difficult game. Most puzzles center around tracking suspects with the right equipment, and interrogating them.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Manley & Associates", "publishers": "Accolade", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.83", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Third_Courier", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbSozt3lig8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73630-the-third-courier\n"}
