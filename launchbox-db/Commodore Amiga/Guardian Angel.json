{"altername_name": ["Freddy Hardest in South Manhattan"], "name": "Guardian Angel", "overview": "In the future NYC has become inhospitable and depraved, with thugs lining every street waiting to pounce on ordinary civilians. Thankfully Freddy Hardest is on hand to face up to the baseball bats and knives, in a side-scrolling beat 'em up game. As with any Dinamic title, the difficulty level is set high.
