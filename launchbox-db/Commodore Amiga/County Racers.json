{"altername_name": [], "name": "County Racers", "overview": "This is not a racing game. This is a test of your memory and patience. You drive along a narrow country road. If you reach the top of the screen, the game switches to the next piece of road. Each time, you have only seconds to react before you crash into an obstacle. Your best bet is to memorize all levels. The overall goal is to beat all ten of them with all of the six available cars.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1999", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Park Productions", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb07f0nWsIU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161938-county-racers\n"}
