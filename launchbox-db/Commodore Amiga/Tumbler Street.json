{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tumbler Street", "overview": "Tumbler Street is a miscellaneous gambling game, developed and published by Vidball, which was released in Europe in 1989. In it, the hoodlum hides the red ball under one of the 3 tumblers, and you have to guess where it is. If you guess correctly, you get some cash, incorrectly you lose. Randomly, the police will show up, and he will take off running...with your cash. The fact that this was sold commercially is a bit too on the nose.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Rolf S.
