{"altername_name": [], "name": "Baron Baldric: A Grave Adventure", "overview": "Baron Baldric: A Grave Adventure is a fun and very rare platformer for Amiga. Although the game is by no means a classic, it is sought after by many Apogee fans because the star of this game, Baron Baldric, would later star Apogee's charming isometric game called Mystic Towers. A Grave Adventure takes you under Castle Pedabouch in search of the family treasures in the tomb by the evil wizard Lazarus. Centuries ago, Baron Baldric's ancestor, Baron Lazarus Pedabouche studied an evil Wolf-Magic and became a cruel tyrant. But when he seized Roise, a local milk-maid, he was stoned to death by his own subjects. Rosie died too, and was doomed to haunt the castle until Lazarus is slain. You have to find flints to light lamps when they go out, and regularly eat food to survive. The game is by no means a classic, but it is a fun platformer that will keep you entertained for at least a few hours. Recommended, especially to Apogee fans of course.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Animation FX", "publishers": "Electronic Arts Australia", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/74906-baron-baldric-a-grave-adventure\n"}
