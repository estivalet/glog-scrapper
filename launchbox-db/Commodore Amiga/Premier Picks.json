{"altername_name": [], "name": "Premier Picks", "overview": "Premier Picks is an unusual card game based around football (soccer). The game takes the form of a 'season' of variable length involving the 20 real-life Premier League teams of the time (name can be edited, but displayed kits can't). Players pick one of the 18 visible cards, to dictate the result of the match. There are several different types of cards in the game - your overall aim is to get more goal cards than the opposition. The other cards include free kicks (which give you another pick), substitutions (which replace that card with another), and penalties (in which you have to run the pointer across the screen, clicking on as many cards as possible - you have a few seconds to find a goal card). The game is split into 2 halves, and each of those has a card which immediately ends the half. Before each half there's a 'card reveal' feature, which, depending on when you click to stop the pointer, reveals between 1 and 6 cards. This has numerous tactical implications, and is the main skill aspect in the game.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tim Blacklock", "publishers": "", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hh6qpZepmg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165138-premier-picks\n"}
