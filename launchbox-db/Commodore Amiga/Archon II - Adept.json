{"altername_name": [], "name": "Archon II: Adept", "overview": "The sequel to Archon, Archon II: Adept features a more complex board and enhanced gameplay. Each side plays as an Adept - a powerful wizard with the ability to cast spells against other Adepts and his summonings - and must defeat the other side, either Chaos or Order, by attacking him/her with summoned Elementals or Demons. Each side can summon 4 unique elementals at a time or choose from 4 demons, common to both. Gameplay is similar to the original, reminiscent of a chess-like board game, requiring strategy, but with arcade elements, especially when two adepts confront each other face-to-face. The board also shifts from time to time, making the strategy less predictable.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "July 1, 1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Free Fall Associates", "publishers": "Electronic Arts, Inc.", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.19", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40644-archon-ii-adept\n"}
