{"altername_name": [], "name": "Barbariana", "overview": "A \u201cdark adventure\u201d and a kind of \u201cover-time\u201d game. A game that develops over time. The actions of NPCs and those of the player are based on a lot of chance and mix with many different attributes of the characters involved. This creates a small sandbox world that you can design yourself. You have to respond to the characters' needs and observe their actions. The player is unspokenly made governor of the place and is supposed to rebuild the destroyed \u201cLittle Meadow Grove\u201d on behalf of his mistress. He has to decide about all the resources and fate of the place. But what lies behind the faces and in the darkness is not obvious. It is impossible to tell whether a farmer is a friend or an enemy.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "August 4, 2023", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "GoodThings Development", "publishers": "GoodThings Development", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA0Ix3QJE9s", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/370872-barbariana\n"}
