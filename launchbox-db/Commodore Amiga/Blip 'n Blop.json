{"altername_name": ["Blip 'n Blop: The Mario Hunters"], "name": "Blip 'n Blop", "overview": "Graphics ripped straight out of Yoshi's Island and what was added looks amateurish at best. The player sprites have too few frames of animation. Despite the omnipresence of ladders in the levels, there is no animation for ladder climbing, so Blip and Blop awkwardly \"wiggle\" up and down when they use them. On the plus side, the background music is quite good and the game is at least playable, brief as it is. I guess there was a bit of a novelty factor in seeing Nintendo and Studio Peyo characters brutally exploded and dismembered. Too me, it looks childish. In 2004, an updated and expanded version of Blip & Blop was released for Windows.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mario Hunters", "publishers": "psycho paths", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162260-blip-n-blop\n"}
