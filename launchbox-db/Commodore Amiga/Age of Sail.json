{"altername_name": [], "name": "Age of Sail", "overview": "The Age of Sail that the title refers to is a period during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries when tall sailing ships dominated the world's navies. Age of Sail is a real time combat game. You control a tall ship and engage in cannon battles with enemy fleets. Gameplay centers around tactical decisions like selection of ordinance for the cannons, using the wind and maneuvering into position to fire at the enemy. In the campaign mode you start as an Ensign for one of four countries - Britain, Spain, France or the United States - and work your way up through the ranks. There are also about one hundred historical scenarios you can play, most of them taking place during the Napoleonic wars and the War of 1812. Scenarios give you control of multiple ships per battle.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "McLEAN Simulations", "publishers": "Conflict Recreations", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/74617-age-of-sail\n"}
