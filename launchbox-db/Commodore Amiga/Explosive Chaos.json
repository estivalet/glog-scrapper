{"altername_name": [], "name": "Explosive Chaos", "overview": "A one or two player bombing game, featuring great graphics, cool levels and some thumping music (with additional download). Mr. Manix, the psychotic scientist has been experimenting on innocent people, turning them into monsters to be controlled by his computers. Naturally you (Billy) and your twin brother (Joel) are the only ones who have the nerve and the bombs to save the day! Almost every level contains a number of computer consoles that most be destroyed to get to the next area. If you destroy all the computers the remaining monsters will break down into wiggly blobs (your mother is a wiggly blob).", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1998", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Blazing Iris Software", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ed61Uh4wDAg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162322-explosive-chaos\n"}
