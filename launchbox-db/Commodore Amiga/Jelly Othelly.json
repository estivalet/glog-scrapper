{"altername_name": [], "name": "Jelly Othelly", "overview": "Very funny and addictive version of Othello. - Very Nice Graphics unlike other Othello games. - Easy to learn, with only one rule! - Hours of fun for any age group. - Introducing the Bazz'o'meter Say no more..... Two players, one red jelly the other green jelly, and the object of the game is to fill the board so there are no blanks left. The player with most squares at the end wins! Your mouse controls a small spoon, which the computer first brings up to the top of the screen, to one side. Then a sort of wheezing, squeezing tube drops down and starts pumping loudly to produce a small blob of jelly which plops into your awaiting spoon. The jelly has a wee cute face too. After that, you control your spoon, and click on an unoccupied board square and you throw the jelly down. But say you were green jelly, and there was a long line of red jelly squares, yet you had a least one green jelly square on one end of the red line, and a blank at the other (or green) then you can pour jelly down on either end and absorb all the red jelly! It is how you win Jelly Othelly!", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Paul Burkey", "publishers": "F1 Licenceware", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXupbcSiDw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164085-jelly-othelly\n"}
