{"altername_name": [], "name": "Atoms", "overview": "Atoms is one of the many unofficial remakes of the 1984 type-in game Critical Mass. Your goal is to wipe out all the other players' atoms before they do it to you. Players take turns to place an atom of their colour on the playing grid. When too many atoms get together in a single square, it will overload and blow outwards to the surrounding squares, overloading them and continuing the blast. When the atoms get blasted, they will change their color to that of the current player.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Michele Berionne", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/160317-atoms\n"}
