The level structures involve different military objectives of protecting or destroying a particular area. The surprise is in the graphics: patchwork-quilt style landscapes and a remote view reminiscent of Virus. The game offers joystick and mouse control options, as well as sections in which you must direct ships and planes. A range of weapons are offered with resupply ships on the water to dock with.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Binary Asylum", "publishers": "Binary Asylum", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeewolf", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/77058-zeewolf-2-wild-justice\n"}
