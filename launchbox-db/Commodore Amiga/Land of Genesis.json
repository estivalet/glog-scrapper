{"altername_name": [], "name": "Land of Genesis", "overview": "Land Of Genesis is a platformer shoot'em up created by Maurizio Gemelli and published in 2001 by ClearWater Interactive for Amiga AGA and Amiga CD machines. Maurizio Gemelli was a former demoscene developer for the Amiga, and he spent three years programming this fantastic action game clearly inspired to Turrican. Land Of Genesis was distributed on CD only and required a very powerful Amiga (at least 68020 with 4MB, but better to have a 68040 with 8MB Fast RAM to enjoy the extended version). The game featured 5 massive levels and all sorts of special effects including 3D video, 512 colors on the screen, 180 different enemies controlled by their AI, plenty of parallax scrolling, and transparent backgrounds. The game was criticized for the extreme difficulty, so you might want to at least change the settings to Easy in the options screen.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Maurizio Gemelli", "publishers": "ClearWater Interactive", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37mnDBgrCNI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/369542-land-of-genesis\n"}
