What was left were hit by radiation poison and mutated unspeakably, and left to live as savages. As the leader of the rebellion you must overthrow thegovernment by invading their headquarters. Caution must be taken however as their base is heavily guarded and the surrounding landscapes are dangerous. The only way to gain access into the fortress is by finding 4 crystal keys.
