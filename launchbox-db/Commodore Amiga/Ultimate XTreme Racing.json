{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ultimate XTreme Racing", "overview": "The CD release of XTreme Racing with additional data including tracks over the original 3 disk version. XTreme Racing is a racing game that utilizes real 3D environments, as opposed to the sprite-based Lotus and the unshaded polygons of World Circuit. The game features a wide environment with full freedom of movement and some Mode 7-style effects. Various pre-made characters can be chosen to represent the player. A course designer and a sound editor are included as well. The difficulty level is customizable, and the cars don't \"cheat\" in terms of artificially keeping up with the player-controlled vehicle or pushing it out of the way and continuing at unabated speed. There many weapons on track to be picked up and fired at will, to deal with the opponents in a more unorthodox way. Multiplayer options allow up to eight human players to compete, achieved linking two systems, similarly to Super Skidmarks.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Silltunna Software", "publishers": "Alive Mediasoft", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRhu8w1sB1E", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/155469-ultimate-xtreme-racing\n"}
