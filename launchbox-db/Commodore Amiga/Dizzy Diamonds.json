{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dizzy Diamonds", "overview": "A columns type clone game by Titanics Entertainment, released in 1992. Like Columns, it involves arranging falling orbs in such a way as to clear them. They are groups of 3 same-size but varying color orbs, which must be arranged into sequences of 3 or more, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Sequences of 4 or 5 count for double or triple points, and diagonal sequences score the most. The real trick is to set up 'combos' - where one line causes other blocks to drop so as to create other lines.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Titanics Entertainment", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWM26IOggnE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/163782-dizzy-diamonds\n"}
