{"altername_name": [], "name": "Marvin's Marvellous Adventure", "overview": "One of the most console-style platformers ever seen on the Amiga, Marvin has approximately 60 levels to battle through. There are stars to collect, extra lives on offer, slides, tubes, ladders, caterpillars to move across, and bonus fruit to collect. The levels are inhabited by typical enemies, some of which are killed by jumping on their heads, while others must be kicked or shot (once you collect a weapon). Many of the annoyances which plague platform games, such as blind jumps and spikes appearing at random, are deliberately absent from this. The graphics are intentionally cute, using the AGA chip-set for 256 colours.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "January 1, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Infernal Byte Systems", "publishers": "21st Century Entertainment", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.62", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/9836-marvins-marvellous-adventure\n"}
