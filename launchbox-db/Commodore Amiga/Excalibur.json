{"altername_name": [], "name": "Excalibur", "overview": "Excalibur is a Shoot 'Em Up game, developed by Next Generation and published by Kingsoft, which was released in Europe in 1988. The game hasn't real story and has quite a simple game play - the player controls a red space ship, flies straightforward, avoid obstacles and shoot enemies in various locations (mostly mountains with space background). The enemies are in many types, shapes and colours - spaceships, 'molecules', geometric figures, etc. If a spaceship flies too slowly, then it has a tendency to fall down. The player has 2 lives.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Next Generation", "publishers": "Kingsoft", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.62", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUTTwzarDtA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/71743-excalibur\n"}
