{"altername_name": [], "name": "Lethal Formula", "overview": "Lethal Formula is a sci-fi point & click graphic adventure about a scientist who has made a major discovery that could help the world, but the corporation he was working for is planning to use his research for far more sinister purposes. Feeling that there is no other option, he decides to take matters into his own hands to stop them. Lethal Formula was one of the demo games to be bundled with GR.A.C. (the \"GRaphic Adventure Creator\"), an adventure game authoring system for the Amiga. Like all GR.A.C. games, the controls are slightly unusual: the left mouse button is only used for making the character walk, and for selecting verb action buttons. To actually perform an action on an object, you need to right-click.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Edmund W.
