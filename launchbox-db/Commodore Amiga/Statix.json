{"altername_name": [], "name": "Statix", "overview": "Take Columns - the Tetris variant that had more in common with Connect 4 than anything else \u2013 and stick it on a see-saw. That's the only way I can think of to describe Statix, one of the most addictive puzzlers I have ever played. Okay, so it might not look like much on a screenshot, and your first thought could well be the same as mine \u2013 it looks like a Gameboy title \u2013 but believe me there is a lot more to it than that. The game starts with a brief description of what you need to do to finish the current level (build a certain number of lines in varying directions), and then all hell breaks loose. Essentially, all you have to do is make sure that neither side of the see saw touches the ground, which can be extremely tricky when you have the whole thing heavily loaded, and then you drop a block that removes half a dozen pieces from one side. Statix is not a very exciting game to look at, but as far as I am concerned it is a very exciting game to play. Admittedly, there are people out there to whom this won't appeal at all. However, if you loved Tetris, you'll get a real kick out of this.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "7th Sign", "publishers": "Black Legend", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1u4a52-QmI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73250-statix\n"}
