{"altername_name": ["L'Amazone Queen"], "name": "Flight of the Amazon Queen", "overview": "Joe King is the hero of this point and click adventure. His plane is carrying actress Faye Russell when it crash lands in a remote jungle, and he must battle through 100 screens of adventure and puzzle. The game's feel is influenced by hammy B-movies, and the characters are quite stereotyped and comic. As standard in point and click adventures, a set of icons at the bottom of the screen allow you to interact with visible characters and items in the main view area.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Interactive Binary Illusions", "publishers": "Renegade Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.31", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_of_the_Amazon_Queen", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/kZmnzcxNrHw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/71929-flight-of-the-amazon-queen\n"}
