{"altername_name": [], "name": "Atic Atac (Goblins)", "overview": "This remake of Atic Atac adds new graphics and sounds to the 1983 action-adventure title, while maintaining the same gameplay of the original. The player controls one of three characters: a knight, a wizard, or a serf, each with unique weapons and routes through the castle. The objective is to navigate the rooms of a haunted castle, killing ghosts, and other supernatural creatures, while collecting the items necessary to open new passages, like keys and other helpful objects. The energy bar is a roasted chicken at the left side of the screen, that is slowly consumed with every hit received by the hero, until only the bones are left on the plate and the player loses one life. Trapdoors and staircases give access to other floors.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "July 28, 2023", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Goblins", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovOozL51z7g", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/370715-atic-atac-goblins\n"}
