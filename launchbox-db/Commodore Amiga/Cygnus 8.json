{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cygnus 8", "overview": "Cygnus 8 is an updated version of the C64 game Star Trader (released in 1984 by Bug-Byte Software). It's essentially a space trading game where the goal is to become rich and famous by buying and selling a variety of commodities, but it's different from most games in the genre in that your main character has a life outside his spaceship as well. He needs food and sleep, and he can do various things while visiting any of the planets in the game. Cygnus 8 is a game which promises much but delivers little. It's not a really bad game, but it's not particularly good either, and while the first hour or so is quite entertaining, the game never really progress anywhere after that and most players will quickly lose interest.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Applaud Software", "publishers": "Islona Entertainment", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/89735-cygnus-8\n"}
