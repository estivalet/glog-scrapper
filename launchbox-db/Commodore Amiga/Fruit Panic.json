{"altername_name": [], "name": "Fruit Panic", "overview": "This is actually a remake of a classic MSX game with the same name. It is a nice twist on the Pac-Man formula. Get all the fruit before the ghosts get you and instead of running through a maze, you'll have to reach fruit on different platforms. You reach higher platforms using a springboard (is that an English word?!) and when a ghosts is tailing you, you can kill it with a limited number of bombs.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jose Angel Calvo", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKecY1XJoFI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162450-fruit-panic\n"}
