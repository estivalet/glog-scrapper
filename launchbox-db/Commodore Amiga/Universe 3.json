{"altername_name": [], "name": "Universe 3", "overview": "Unlike the first two games in the series, which fell into the roleplaying and resource-management category, Universe 3 poses true logic-based puzzles for you to solve. Your characters move about in much the same way as their counterparts in Breach, Omnitrend's tactical combat RPG. You set out to escort a diplomat on a trip to the hyperspace booster (a key element of Universe 2) to investigate the disappearance of shipments from Earth to this remote corner of the star map. The story takes a quick twist when you and your crew are captured, forcing you to rack up some criminal charges during your escape. You'll spend the rest of your time looking for evidence about the missing shipments, which will clear you of the charges as well as wrap up the mystery.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Omnitrend Software, Inc.", "publishers": "Impressions Games", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/122063-universe-3\n"}
