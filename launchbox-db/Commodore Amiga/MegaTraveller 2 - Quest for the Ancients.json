{"altername_name": [], "name": "MegaTraveller 2: Quest for the Ancients", "overview": "Well it's all about saving doomed planets, generating a fabulous party of characters, having the odd barney chances are you've been down a similar road before. So. Gather a gang, get a liberal sprinkle of characters - doctors, diplomats, complete nutters - and travel the galaxy. Chance meetings at the right time provide the route to success. Mega Traveler 2 is huge and detailed, though it looks a little basic. But it remains a slightly above average RPG. It is a very faithful adaptation of the Traveller role-playing game with over 100 fully explorable planets (most with multiple cities and each with it's own sub-quests) and a non-linear story line.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Paragon Software", "publishers": "Empire Software", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MegaTraveller_2:_Quest_for_the_Ancients", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHIPhei10Po", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72340-megatraveller-2-quest-for-the-ancients\n"}
