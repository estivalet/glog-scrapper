{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Art of GO", "overview": "\"The Go player must contend less with his opponent and more with conflicting impulses and emotions within himself.\" Go is based on the ancient board game of Chinese origin, which is very popular today in Japan and other Asian countries. In recent years, though, the game has become increasingly popular in the United States, Canada, and Europe because of its challenging nature. The game is played with black and white stones on a grid of 19 vertical and 19 horizontal lines. Although the rules of the game are very simple, the strategy necessary to win is very complex -- comparable to chess. The game will stimulate both analytical and intuitive thought processes.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Software Publishing Associates", "publishers": "Anco Software", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/74636-the-art-of-go\n"}
