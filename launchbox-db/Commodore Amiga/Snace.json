{"altername_name": [], "name": "Snace", "overview": "I made this in 95/96. so it doesn't represent my work today. It was my first \"big\" idea/project and later based on another game on aminet which involved controlling your \"car\" on a few coloured tracks.The game was playable, but it lacked versatility mainly because it was turned based. My \"clone\" is real time and uses 16 colors, but has just 2 players. the tracks you can select have different filename Prefixes(before filename) which means, race: E - an easy track M - a mediocre track (average) H - a hard track misc: F - a fun track T - a test track , to test new combinations and drawings B - a bad track. u cant reach finish, or my code doesn't handle the track the way its supposed to be TUTORIAL - for beginners or when representing a new palette I - a track with useful info or other miscellaneous things", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Joar Berntsen", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbImy1mQ5r8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164621-snace\n"}
