{"altername_name": [], "name": "Burning Rubber", "overview": "Despite the smutty title, the only \u2018big people\u2019 requirement is a driving license, as you\u2019re racing through Europe and America in a variety of cars. Each level has a visual background reflecting part of the country. The route is mapped out beforehand, but it needn\u2019t be strictly adhered to, as the surrounding roads are all presented and can be used as you wish. The computer cars in the race will often deviate from the course as well, adding real navigation to the proceedings. You accrue damage from contact, which needs to be repaired after the race, so you need to keep some prize money coming in.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Harlequin", "publishers": "Ocean Software Ltd.", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.86", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72116-burning-rubber\n"}
