{"altername_name": ["Midwinter II: Flames of Freedom"], "name": "Flames of Freedom", "overview": "This chapter continues the story of the people of the Isle of Midwinter. Now, they have left their homeland and joined forces with the people of Agora, forming the Atlantic Federation. Their arch enemies, the Saharan Empire, control each of the 42 Atlantic Islands except Agora. As a special agent of the federation you must complete top secret missions designed to initiate rebellion among the Saharan people. I am glad to say that this game is much better than the excellent original. The game boasts a staggering 1,000,000 square miles of terrain for you to explore, utilising 22 different modes of transportation with which to get around. This game has such depth that you will be lost in it for hours, if not days once you get involved.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Maelstrom", "publishers": "Kixx", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flames_of_Freedom", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYpryGNFzCU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72364-flames-of-freedom\n"}
