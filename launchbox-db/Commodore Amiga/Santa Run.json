{"altername_name": [], "name": "Santa Run", "overview": "Originally created in a week by Graeme Cowie (McGeezer) as a cheer up COVID 2020 gift to Amigans everywhere. Control Santa as you leap from roof to roof and deliver presents down the chimneys. It's also a score-based game, and thus each run will be short. All you have to do is to reach the end of the street and you will have completed the game. Santa Run is a score based game, if you reach the end of the street you will have completed the game. A nice greeting awaits at the end of the game. In the Title screen you can push Left for easy mode and Right for hard mode. Easy mode you will be given 150 gifts to throw into the chimneys and 10 special Elf jumps. Hard mode you will be given 100 gifts and only 5 special Elf Jumps. In hard mode you get more points for reaching further into the game.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2020", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Graeme Cowie", "publishers": "Double Sided Games", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ2Q8_lGYcc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161960-santa-run\n"}
