{"altername_name": [], "name": "Roller Coaster Rumbler", "overview": "Nearly 5 years before Rebel Assault and other fully-rendered CD-ROM titles popularised the rail-shooter gameplay, Tynesoft used it for a game with an unusual setting. You are on board a roller coaster which has been layered with targets to shoot out. The roller coaster follows its natural path, swinging from side to side and up and down, while you aim a turret at the targets and shoot them out. After completing its cycle, the roller coaster reverses, moving through the same area moving backwards. A co-operative two player mode exists, in which each player controls a crosshair. Make sure to hang on as the ride turns.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Subway Software", "publishers": "Tynesoft Computer Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roller_Coaster_Rumbler", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/108406-roller-coaster-rumbler\n"}
