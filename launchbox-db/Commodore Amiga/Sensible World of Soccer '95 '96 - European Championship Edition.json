{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sensible World of Soccer '95/'96: European Championship Edition", "overview": "Sensible World of Soccer '95/'96 is the successor to Sensible World of Soccer. Besides updated team rosters, the most important additions are two new moves (curved passes with the after-touch system and standing headers), updated representation of athlete statistics (stars instead of numbers, each athlete has up to three specialist skills such as heading-shooting-finishing), the ability to tag an athlete (then he has a small diamond above his head during the match) and reserve teams. Smaller optical changes include animated audience or some new animations after a goal is scored. Also the active player's name is shown on the screen.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sensible Software", "publishers": "Renegade", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "64", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.94", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensible_World_of_Soccer", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73017-sensible-world-of-soccer-9596-european-championship-edition\n"}
