{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dizzy Lizzy", "overview": "An AMOS based freeware conversion of the ST game similar to that of Boulderdash, created by the original ST programmers, the Happening Boiz in 1991. Dizzy Lizzy is a Boulder Dash clone where you guide Dizzy on his quest to collect diamonds. On every level you have to collect all of the diamonds before you may continue to the next level. You have to watch out for boulders, Wayne (who will only move when you stand still), dynamite and bombs. Bombs does not go off the moment they hit an obstacle, you have about five moves before they detonate. After a bomb detonates a large area becomes impassible, so the player has to be careful not to get trapped.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Happening Boiz", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/371939-dizzy-lizzy\n"}
