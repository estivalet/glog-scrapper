{"altername_name": [], "name": "Zerg", "overview": "An early Amiga PD Role Playing Game, created by Mike Shapiro. It is a Sword and Sorcery, topdown, Ultima style RPG. Released in 1989 for Amiga on Fish Disk 252; new version released in 1990. The title is as bare-bones as you can get, with basic inventory and basic character development. Its primary virtue is brevity plus a certain wit. It is also a rare Ultima clone for the Amiga. (It displays a roughly-Ultima II technology level, minus the dungeons, with a quest system that goes back to Akalabeth.) The game takes place in the land of Zerg, which is having problems with monsters. Each player controls the same character, named \"Wanderer,\" who starts out as a Level 1 fighter with 75 strength, 75 wisdom, 75 agility, and 50 hit points. The game begins next to a king's castle, where the king is looking for a hero to slay monsters and bring back their cadavers. The king will use these trophies \"to help investors feel more secure.\"", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mike Shapiro", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OXhnQJ-4PA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161909-zerg\n"}
