{"altername_name": [], "name": "Uridium 2", "overview": "Re-enter your manta in the sequel to one of the fastest 8-bit action games. You are sent out to take out half a dozen enemy battle groups, each consisting of four huge spaceships. Similar to the first Uridium, you face increasing numbers of unfriendly fighter wings and stationary defenses while sweeping over the carriers. The real challenge here is to avoid the many walls on the back of the vessel while you are under attack. After the exterior has been cleaned from most of the enemy presence you take care of the ships' reactor core in a jump-and-run-like sequence. While floating in a non-gravity surrounding, lower the core's shields and then destroy it. The game also gives you a number of extra weapons that can be collected by either flying over pick-ups left from dead enemy wings or by catching them after the power generator has been destroyed.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Graftgold Creative Software", "publishers": "Renegade Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.05", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uridium_2", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/VLKI-7TYPBw?t=33s", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72014-uridium-2\n"}
