{"altername_name": [], "name": "Arsenal FC: The Computer Game", "overview": "Thalamus secured the license for this arcade/management footy sim after Arsenal won the English Premier League in 1991-92. Scheduled for release in Sept/Oct '92 with the inclusion of an official Arsenal souvenir (whoopie cushion perhaps??!!), the game never materialised on any platform due to Thalamus' financial woes which forced them into receivership in 1993. No doubt ARSENAL FC's failure to hit store shelves was a terrible disappointment to Man Utd fans and other English Premier League club fans the world over!", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Cirrus", "publishers": "Thalamus", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165471-arsenal-fc-the-computer-game\n"}
