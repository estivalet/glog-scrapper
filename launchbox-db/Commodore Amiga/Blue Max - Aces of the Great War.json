{"altername_name": [], "name": "Blue Max: Aces of the Great War", "overview": "Time to take to the air and give Boche his due -it's a World War One flying ace sim. The game itself is a 3D flight sim dressed up in First World War garb. On loading you are presented with a menu from which you can choose various parameters for your flight. If you register yourself as a flyer then you can keep track of your record as a fighter pilot, amassing a set of statistics on missions accomplished and kills made. You can choose to be an allied or German pilot, and you get to choose your plane too. You control your flight using the mouse, joystick or computer keyboard. The mouse is the most responsive method, but if you're playing two player mode one of you has to use the keyboard. Two player mode is fun, with you either choosing to fight cooperatively or have a dog fight against each other. The flying itself is good enough. You fly around, shoot things and get shot at - what more is there to say. If you want to go on a campaign you get given a mission to accomplish, like shooting down a bridge in France. There's a suitably First World War atmosphere to it all, but in other respects it's an average flight sim.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Artech Digital Entertainment", "publishers": "Mindscape International", "genres": "Flight Simulator", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "2.94", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Max:_Aces_of_the_Great_War", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75078-blue-max-aces-of-the-great-war\n"}
