{"altername_name": [], "name": "Santa & Rudolph Do Christmas!", "overview": "A collect and avoid, shooter game where you can play as either Santa or Rudolph. They both play exactly the same, as far as I could tell, and the only difference is the levels are the same when playing as Rudolph but in a new order and have new names. Your goal is to fly around the level, shoot enemies, and deliver all presents within the time limit. Similar to Bombjack, enemies turn into deadlier versions of themselves when the timer runs out.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ian West", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apu9kd7Z_Qw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161476-santa-rudolph-do-christmas\n"}
