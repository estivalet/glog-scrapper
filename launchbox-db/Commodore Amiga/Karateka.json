{"altername_name": [], "name": "Karateka", "overview": "Jordan Mechner\u2019s first game for the Apple II, Karateka was a huge success that paves the developer path to a successful career that includes the Prince of Persia franchise. After released for the Apple II, Kareteka was ported to many platforms including Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, Atari 8-bit and ST and many others. But never for the Amiga. After almost 30 years, the iconic game finally found its way to the Amiga OS, thanks to English Amiga Board forum user meynaf. His Amiga version was directly ported from the Atari ST version in only a few days. The game was impressive when running on the Apple II due to its animation and some gameplay elements like cut-scenes, which have never been used before. On more advanced platforms like the ST, the game did also pretty well but maybe wasn\u2019t more that innovative as the original version.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2016", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "meynaf", "publishers": "", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/160992-karateka\n"}
