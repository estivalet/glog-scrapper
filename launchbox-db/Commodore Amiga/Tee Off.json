{"altername_name": ["Tee Off!"], "name": "Tee Off", "overview": "Tee Off! is an overhead-view golf game using mouse control. There are four courses on offer: Sunnymede, Runcorn, Petersfield and Overbridge. Beginner, amateur and pro modes are offered, affecting the distances to the pin. Shot placement involves a 3-click routine to set pace and spin, with a full range of clubs (but no on-screen reminder of their maximum distance). Holes incorporate bunkers, trees and sand-traps, although trees are not considered to be Out of Bounds - on occasion you can end up having to play shots from atop a tree.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Energize", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7xXbo75loo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73585-tee-off\n"}
