{"altername_name": [], "name": "Temptations", "overview": "A Redpill Amiga conversion of an MSX game released in the late 1980's, like in the original version, the Franciscan monk Noni wants to join the Vitigudina order. To judge his valor, the order asks for a test of virtue: the monk has to collect weapons and use them to exorcise all the demons of a village. Temptations is a Spanish flick-screen platform game. The game is divided in a series of levels, each with a series of screens. The player controls the monk's movements with the ARROW KEYS or the JOYSTICK. Pressing the SPACE BAR or the FIRE BUTTON shoots the projectile weapon he is carrying. The friar is killed if he touches the demons or some of the screen objects. His movement has inertia: after landing on a platform he usually keeps sliding forward (that is something that must be taken on account when planning how to move from one screen to the other). Shooting choice spots on the screen reveals hidden power-ups that can be collected, and some screens require the use of a specific power-up to reach their exit. The game starts with 10 lives and has no form of saving progress", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2022", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "SoY", "publishers": "Topo Soft", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnH1dni5cW4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/167546-temptations\n"}
