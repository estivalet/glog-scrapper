{"altername_name": [], "name": "Soko-Ban 84", "overview": "Remake of the game Soko Ban released in 1982 and presented at AmiGameJam21 . Coded in AMOS, this is the first tukinem game. The game has 53 levels. There are three display modes to choose from: CGA, Tandy, and Amiga. Soko-Ban is a classic puzzle game, the basis of many clones in recent years. It is installed in a warehouse. At each level, the player must push crates (from square to square) to bring them to the designated places; once each crate is in a marked location, the level is complete. Crates can only be pushed one at a time (so two side-by-side crates can't be pushed together) and can't be pulled - so it's possible to get a crate stuck in a corner, where it can't be recovered! At the later levels, you need to plan 40 stages in advance. Updates in 2022 added Dual Playfield and high scores.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2021", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "tukinem", "publishers": "", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165019-soko-ban-84\n"}
