{"altername_name": [], "name": "Attacks", "overview": "Modeled after the arcade game Ataxx, Attacks is a reversi variant where you try to fill a bigger portion of the board than your opponent. You can only move either next to your own piece in which case both the old and the new piece will stay on board or jump over an empty square, in which case the original position will empty itself. All pieces surrounding the one you moved to will change their color to yours. The game is concluded when either all the empty squares are filled or only one color is remaining.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Scott Biggs", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWzhW-MBmJ0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/160320-attacks\n"}
