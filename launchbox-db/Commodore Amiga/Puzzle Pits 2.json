{"altername_name": [], "name": "Puzzle Pits 2", "overview": "Once upon a time there was a king who had three sons. The eldest was known as Kenneth the Brave. The second was known as Corin the Strong. The youngest was known as the Kevin the Clever. The princes also had a sister known as Gwendolyn the Beautiful. Now in those days there were a lot of evil sorcerers running around and kidnapping princesses and sisters. Gwendolyn, being both a princess and a sister was naturally a target. Dulak the Evil, kidnapped the princess and let it be known that there were only 2 ways to get Gwendolyn back, by paying him an insanely large amount of gold or by sending a champion who could pass all of the obstacles in the dungeon. Kenneth the Brave volunteered immediately, showing his courage. Corin offered to go along but Kevin decided to wait and see what would happen to his brothers. Meanwhile, Gwendolyn, who was brave, strong and clever as well as beautiful escaped from the dungeon by herself, which drove Dulak into such a fit that he accidentally locked himself inside one of his own magical traps. She related how she had seen her brothers Kenneth and Corin, turned into statues as she fled. Kevin decided that he must go to set his brothers free. Kevin, Gwendolyn and the court wizard all worked together to train Kevin before his departure. You act as Kevin, preparing for his face-off against Dulak in the puzzle pits. Push the pylon's to the blue spaces, it gets harder as you go.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Spartan Design", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drO3nMyRcjs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162820-puzzle-pits-2\n"}
