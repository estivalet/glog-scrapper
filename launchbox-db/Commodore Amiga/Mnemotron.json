{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mnemotron", "overview": "Mnemotron is a simple, two-player game of Concentration, with the added twist that there are animated images on the tiles. There are two game modes: one of them is 'training' (allows you to solve any single level), and the other one is 'game' (you play through all the available levels in sequence.) There is a high score table for the best solvers. You can play with another human or with a computer (there are a couple of AI skill levels available). During the game, you click on any two covered tiles; if they match, a short tune plays (different for each picture). You get score for uncovering the tiles; once all of them are uncovered, the player with the higher score wins the level.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "TimSoft", "publishers": "TimSoft", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/146893-mnemotron\n"}
