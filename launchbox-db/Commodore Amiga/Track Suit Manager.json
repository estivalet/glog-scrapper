{"altername_name": ["Tracksuit Manager"], "name": "Track Suit Manager", "overview": "In this simulation, you get to manage any one of the European national squads and take them through friendly matches and the various stages of the European Nations Cup and the World Cup. If you are feeling a bit masochistic, you can take on the managership of the England side with its built-in list of players. Or maybe you would fancy another country in which case you'll have to type in your own players a minimum of 30 and a maximum of 100 players in all. You specify their playing position - goalkeeper, defence, midfield or forward (and, optionally, their home club) and the program takes care of the rest. TSM disappointingly makes no use at all of the Amiga's potential - it looks like a straight conversion job from 8 bit machines - it still manages to be an absorbing, addictive and stimulating game. If the above flaws could be attended to, it would be magnificent. As it is, Track Suit Manager is merely excellent.
