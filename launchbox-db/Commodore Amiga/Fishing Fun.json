{"altername_name": [], "name": "Fishing Fun", "overview": "Don't forget to pack your sunscreen for a long day of fishing at the lake, America's favorite pass-time. Fresh water fishing is the best for relaxation and fun. Of course there are also weeds, poison ivy, flies and snakes but FUN right! Well with this game you get all the experience with none of the calamine lotion. So leave your sunscreen at home, but pack your patience and get ready to angle. Choose boat fishing or dock\\shore fishing, choose your alter ego, set the type of fish and the goal like Bluegill 11+ would mean you need to catch at least 11 bluegills this session. Remember to get the worms first!", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1997", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "RW Benjamin", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOMgUQcaauo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162491-fishing-fun\n"}
