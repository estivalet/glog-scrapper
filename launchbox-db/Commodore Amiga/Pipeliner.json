{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pipeliner", "overview": "A Pipe Dream clone. Each level of this abstract puzzler challenges the player to set up a network of pipes to allow an unspecified substance to flow through as many of those as possible. The pieces are offered in random order, and there are seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the liquid straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered from either side. When the liquid hits a gap or a piece that the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Only Games", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqkVRkPn9Fs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162224-pipeliner\n"}
