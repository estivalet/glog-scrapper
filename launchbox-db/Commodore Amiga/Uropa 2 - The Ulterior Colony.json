Uropa2's future is also pretty grim. Basically, the Solar System is divided between the Intercorp Tekits (goodies) and the Kapones (baddies). The Kapones are an evil rebel force who are in cahoots with some even more evil aliens who want to use the Kapones to help them take control of the entire universe. The Kapone's main communications base for summoning the evil slimy aliens is based on the moon of Uropa, which orbits Jupiter. You play the part of a Tekite warrior robot and your mission involves Kapone's communications base before they can 'phone home' and get alien help. To make matters worse the Kapones are holding some colonists hostage, so your floating metal mickey has to conduct a series of special ops to rescue the colonists and blow up the base.
