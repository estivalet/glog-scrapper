{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Executioner", "overview": "The Executioner is a Shooter game, developed by Avant Garde and published by Hawk, which was released in Europe in 1991. This game is as original as Thrust, Gravitar, Choplifter and Olds. Prettier, perhaps, with some extra bells and whistles but essentially the same. There\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with taking a great idea, improving and developing It. But with this game it\u2019s hard to see where the improvements have been carried out. That\u2019s sad, especially when you look at some of the other games recently released, such as Utopia, Megalomania and Magic Pockets. All three have taken a tried and trusted game formula and pushed it one step further by enhancing the gameplay, and adding something fresh and exciting. There are really too many better games to buy with your money. Sorry, but there\u2019s no way this Executioner is a killer.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Avant Garde", "publishers": "Hawk", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.38", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DL7qI6NsUk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/65668-the-executioner\n"}
