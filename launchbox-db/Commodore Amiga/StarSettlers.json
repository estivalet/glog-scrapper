{"altername_name": ["Stern Siedler", "Star Settlers"], "name": "StarSettlers", "overview": "StarSettlers is a menu-based strategy game in which the player has to conquer 50 solar systems (each one representing a level) with up to eight planets each. Colonies need resources, technology and people. The player's job is to set details like birthrate and money distribution to reach the required economical balance for the colony to thrive. The progression is measured in various numbers like evolution rate or intelligence. Because the other planets don't stand still, it is useful to think of defenses. When another planet is conquered, it requires the same amount of management as the first, all while the clock is ticking in real-time.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Oase Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9icZUufUVA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/157307-starsettlers\n"}
