{"altername_name": ["Advanced Dungeons & Dragons: Pools of Darkness: A Forgotten Realms Fantasy Role-Playing Epic, Vol.IV"], "name": "Pools of Darkness", "overview": "Pools of Darkness is the fourth of Gold Box series of classic-style AD&D-based role-playing games. The gameplay is quite similar to other games of this type. At the start of the game, the player creates a party of characters (up to 6). Classic AD&D races (dwarf, elf, half-elf, gnome, etc.), character classes (fighter, paladin, monk, wizard, etc.), alignments (Good/Evil and Lawful/Chaotic axis), and statistics (strength, intelligence, wisdom, etc.) are there for the player to choose and adjust. Once the party is created, the player begins the exploration of the city of Phlan. Upon exiting the city, the player explores a top-down map, visiting dungeons and other locations of interest, as well as engaging in combat.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Strategic Simulations", "publishers": "Strategic Simulations", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pools_of_Darkness", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/ZINGqTgwm5g", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/71971-pools-of-darkness\n"}
