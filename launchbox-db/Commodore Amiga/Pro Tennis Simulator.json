{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pro Tennis Simulator", "overview": "This tennis game offers bare-bones action for one or two players. There are 3 computer skill levels on offer, and matches can be 1, 3 or 5 sets. The gameplay is viewed from above and behind the net, with a slight 3D effect. The type of shot played is determined by how high the ball is as you hit it. The full service rules are implemented, and the fire button must be pressed once to throw the ball up, and a second time to hit it with the racket.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Codemasters Software", "publishers": "Codemasters Software", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109720-pro-tennis-simulator\n"}
