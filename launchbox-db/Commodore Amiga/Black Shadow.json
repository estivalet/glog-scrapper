{"altername_name": [], "name": "Black Shadow", "overview": "You are the pilot of a spaceship who has just been deployed above a deserted asteroid named \"Black Shadow\", which is presumed to be the former habitation of hostile aliens. You have made it past the defensive shields, but the other ships in your squadron were not so lucky. And now one of the structures, on what was supposed to be an abandoned world, has begun to open... Black Shadow is a vertically scrolling shoot-em-up. You control a spaceship, which can move around in the bottom half of the screen. Alien ships attempt to run into you, and ground-based structures pose as navigational hazards, and can also shoot at you. Your ship fires both normal bullets that are effective against the ships, and bombs which detonate on the ground some fixed distance ahead of your ship. The aim of the game is to fly to a base at the end of the level, destroy it, and then repeat for the remaining levels. You start the game with three lives. Each ship can withstand three hits from enemies before being destroyed, after which you must start the level over again. There are both one and two player modes. In two player mode, if one of the player's ship is destroyed, both return to the start of the level.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "The Zen Room", "publishers": "CRL Group", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75335-black-shadow\n"}
