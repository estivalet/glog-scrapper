{"altername_name": ["F1 GP Circuits"], "name": "F1 G.P. Circuits", "overview": "F1 GP Circuits is a Racing game, developed by Magnetica and published by Idea, which was released in Europe in 1991. Climb into your \"McLoren\" and stick those \"Goodyar\" tyres on, then prepare yourself for one hell of an awful, slow and irritating game play. If there were not a few delicacies such as \"Supercars\" or \"Indy 500\" the thing for F1 GP Circuits might look quite different. F1 GP Circuits shows the events from the bird's eye view and reminds strongly of the somewhat older \"Grand Prix Master\" (motorcycle racing) game, only this one is on four instead of two wheels on the road. There are four cars and nine tracks with 20 opponents. In addition, player see too little of the route, because much valuable space was wasted on informational blocks (speed, lap, time, fuel, next curve). And it is certainly not a compliment for an Amiga game: the C64 version is graphically almost equivalent and sound is even better!
