{"altername_name": [], "name": "Spatial Hyperdrive", "overview": "A very great little party game for two at a time. It is addictive and can be used in competition races between more players. In it, you are a pilot who must navigate his ship down a horizontally-scrolling tunnel. Your craft crawls along at first but speed gradually increases until it breakneck pace. As you go, the once roomy tunnel narrows precipitously and branches into even narrower forks. Pick your route as some are far more demanding than others. You have a number of shield points and you lose one every time you make contact with the wall. Simple, hectic,demanding and FUN!", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "The Nu-Grafik Association", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurhu7JWnX4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161751-spatial-hyperdrive\n"}
