{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Game", "overview": "You gather new abilities along the way which opens up new areas. You have unlimited lives and the game can be rather brutal at some places, but just keep on trying and you will prevail :) The \"torches\" are checkpoints and you will spawn by the latest one you touched if you die. Controls are simple, left and right to move and fire to jump, press down to drop through some floors.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "2015", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "David Eriksson", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncCPGBIEm9s", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161941-the-game\n"}
