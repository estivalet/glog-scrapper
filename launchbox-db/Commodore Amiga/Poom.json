Poom is reasonably fast on its intended target processor (68020 or better) and the 256x200 version is detailed. The gameplay area is large, with numerous corridors and functioning doors. It is something of an empty world but was a promising engine at the time.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jissi Salmi", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/373396-poom\n"}
