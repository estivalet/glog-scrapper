{"altername_name": [], "name": "Benny Beetle in Colorworld", "overview": "Benny Beetle in Colorworld is a top-down action game. The player takes the role of Benny Beetle, surprisingly a beetle, who has to cross overall 200 one-screen rooms which are divided into four worlds. The most important elements are the colored fields on the floor which morph when Benn moves over them, for example pink fields become yellow and yellow fields disappear. The latter is the goal because disappearing fields leave stuff behind: extra points for the high-score list, gold to purchase weapons or items (e.g. keys) which have to be used in order to overcome obstacles and proceed to the next rooms. Unfortunately the room also include other beetles which want to kill Benny. Ranged weapons are used to kill them, but the equipped weapons can't be fired while moving and the enemies respawn shortly after.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Andreas Turowski", "publishers": "Mac Soft", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/74935-benny-beetle-in-colorworld\n"}
