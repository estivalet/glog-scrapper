You are enclosed inside an electrofield which must not be touched by the controller. If you do, your energy will be drained and the bonus will be set to zero. The entity is in multiple parts and can be harmless or harmful. These various forms will attempt to get to the side walls and cause a drain of energy. If it makes contact with the wall, it will mutate into more harmful form. To stop them reaching the walls, you simply sweep Stix over them. A bonus life is given every twenty thousand points.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "CSM", "publishers": "CSM", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90746-entity-cms-software\n"}
