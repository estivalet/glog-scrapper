{"altername_name": ["Stunt Track Racer"], "name": "Stunt Car Racer", "overview": "Race a single computer opponent for first place on a unique racetrack -- 100 feet in the air! You start in the fourth three-man division of a league, all racing each other twice, and must come top to progress. The action is viewed from within the car throughout the 3-lap races, with the distance between you always on screen. Jump chasms, jumps, and drawbridges; take banks hard or slow; pass your opponent on the track or while catching mass air. Your car has the ability to burn a limited amount of turbo boost fuel as a way to accelerate faster and achieve higher speeds, but don't use it all up at once or you'll fall behind. Don't damage your engine too much; severe dents will show up during your next race. Whatever you do, don't fall off the track, as this will cost you time as you are placed back on.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Geoff Crammond", "publishers": "MicroStyle", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.32", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stunt_Car_Racer", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hpdj4mAxxM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/9142-stunt-car-racer\n"}
