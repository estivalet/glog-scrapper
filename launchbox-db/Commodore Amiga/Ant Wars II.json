{"altername_name": ["Ant Wars 1.9"], "name": "Ant Wars II", "overview": "After the first few millenia of happily obliterating each other, the two separate species of ants, the blacks and the reds, were teetering on the brink of extinction. Into this somewhat dodgy situation in popped Joel Battistututu, an ant completely convinced that he was the second incarnation of Christ. Joel decided to try his utmost to preserve the remaining ants by genetically manipulating them being completely identical - how could you destroy something that is identical to yourself after all? After some careful thinking, the ants decided to kill each others anyway. Ant Wars II (or Ant Wars 1.9) is a hybrid between Artillery games like Scorched Earth and Worms. Your goal is to destroy the opposing ant colony using the weapons available that you can buy from the armory with the money you get from the field or buy winning the rounds.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Paranoid", "publishers": "Lionheart", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/159603-ant-wars-ii\n"}
