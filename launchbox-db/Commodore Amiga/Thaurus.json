{"altername_name": ["Samotnik"], "name": "Thaurus", "overview": "Thaurus is an adaptation of the Peg Solitaire board game. The game consists of two similar timed modes: Samotnik and Thaurus. In Samotnik mode the action takes place on a standard board of 45 figures. All figures are the same and cover all fields except the middle one. The main task is to remove as many figures as possible, leaving only one at best. The pawns are removed by translating them in horizontal or vertical direction. The game ends when there is no possibility of movement. The result depends on the number of pawns remaining on the board. Thaurus mode uses same rules but is much harder, as it introduces a special field (or fields) where the last remaining pawn (or pawns) should stay at the end. Before each new board player receives a level password.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atares", "publishers": "", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165384-thaurus\n"}
