{"altername_name": [], "name": "Momotarou Densetsu II", "overview": "Momotarou Densetsu II (\"Peachboy Legend II\") is an RPG for the PC Engine of the standard turn-based Dragon Quest mold. It is the second proper game in Hudson's Momotarou Densetsu series - which would later spawn the Momotarou Dentetsu series of railroad virtual board games - and features numerous other figures from Japanese mythology. The general structure of the game has Momotarou cross the world with his animal NPC companions, solving the problems of each new town or village he comes across. Upon successfully resolving their demon problem, the town thanks him with elaborate celebrations. Momotarou can eventually pick up a large number of allies, who all follow behind him on the world map. Rather than force the player to locate each new location, they can send their animal companions to scout ahead to eliminate the amount of wandering around.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "December 22, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hudson Soft", "publishers": "Hudson Soft", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.9", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHO-qWXuvZk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/70228-momotarou-densetsu-ii\n"}
