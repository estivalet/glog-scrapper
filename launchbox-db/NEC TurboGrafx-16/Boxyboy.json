{"altername_name": ["Soukoban World", "\u5009\u5eab\u756aWORLD"], "name": "Boxyboy", "overview": "Boxyboy is a Soko-Ban variant, explicitly based on the gameplay of the original version by Thinking Rabbit. The gameplay is unchanged, but the game features 250 new levels. They take place in five different countries with their own graphics set. The basic principle: The player works in a warehouse and needs to clear out the boxes which are spread out over the level. Those boxes have to pushed into certain places of the level which are marked. However, the player character can only push a box; pulling is out of the question. This means it is possible to create a dead end by pushing a box in the wrong way. If that happens, the undo function can be used to take back the last steps.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "March 16, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Thinking Rabbit", "publishers": "NEC Technologies", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.92", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxyboy", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/7881-boxyboy\n"}
