After a flash of lightning and a scream, Jennifer is gone, and Rick is left wearing the Terror Mask, which gives the wearer great strength. Rick must survive seven blood-soaked levels full of corpses, demons, and other disturbing creatures in this arcade side-scrolling beat-em-up. Several weapons are at Rick's disposal throughout the house, such as a meat cleaver, a two by four, and a shotgun. If Rick wants to find Jennifer alive, he must move quickly through the floors of the mansion.... as a happy reunion is not always guaranteed.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "April 3, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Namco", "publishers": "Namco", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.79", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splatterhouse", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TmHT6OqTBY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/3572-splatterhouse\n"}
