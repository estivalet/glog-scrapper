{"altername_name": [], "name": "Kaizou Choujin Shubibinman", "overview": "The evil robot Dark Skull has escaped Doc's control and now threatens to destroy the city with his army of evil robots, now only Doc's newest creations: the cyborgs Tasuke and Kyapiko can put an end to his plans. Shubibinman is a 2D side-scrolling action platformer, in which you play as either of the Shubibinmen (or both in the cooperative 2-player mode) and try to defeat Dark Skull's forces using your blade and your cyborg-powers. The game starts in a city-map from which you select which stage to tackle next, each stage features a hostage and a boss cyborg that must be defeated. Successful completion of these objectives rewards you with money that you can take back to \"Doc\" for upgrades that augment your existing powers or add new ones, which you'll surely need for the final battle.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "March 18, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "NCS", "publishers": "Masaya", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.54", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/34274-kaizou-choujin-shubibinman\n"}
