It\u2019s a conversion of what most people know as Wonder Boy in Monster Land. This game takes a different pace from the first Wonder Boy game, being more of an adventure with a slower pace and more strategy. You start the game with barely a thread on and are given a sword by some wise looking dude who lives in a tree. It is then your task to travel through the various platform-based levels defeating monsters and evil bosses along the way. Each enemy you kill leaves behind a coin or money bag (these are also at various hidden locations if you jump at the right spot) and shops will offer you armour, shields, weaponry and go-faster shoes. You can also pop into a bar and top up your energy if you can afford it. Levels are time limited (shown by an egg-timer on the left) so you need to be quick, or energy is taken away from your heart meter.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "October 30, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Westone", "publishers": "Hudson Soft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.28", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuZeNfVO_2U", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/70103-bikkuriman-world\n"}
