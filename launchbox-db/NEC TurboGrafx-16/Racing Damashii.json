{"altername_name": ["Racing Spirits", "Racing Damashii", "Racing Damashii"], "name": "Racing Damashii", "overview": "Racing Damashii is a motorcycle racing game with six courses. It is basically action-oriented, but the player needs to watch the damage of the motorcycle (decreases with crashes) and the tire condition (decreases when leaving the road). If one of the two bars runs out, the race is over, but repairs are conducted during pit stops. The two playing modes for single-player are training races and a championship in which points are awarded for good end positions. Those can be reinvested into motorcycle upgrades. The perspective is 3D with the camera fixed behind the player's vehicle.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "July 19, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Irem", "publishers": "Irem", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.45", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racing_Damashii", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fBc1jjDFGo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/71366-racing-damashii\n"}
