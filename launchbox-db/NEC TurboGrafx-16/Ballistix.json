You fire balls at warp-speed, blasting it towards the enemy goal. Ricochet it off walls and bumpers. Hit a splitter and balls explode in a swarming barrage! The field changes to make each level more intense. Acid pools swallow the puck. Pitch arrows propel it. Your enemy cannons it into a tunnel and it shoots out towards your goal! Get a shield to save it! Score big to enter your name in the Hall of Fame in a nonstop Ballistix frenzy.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "December 13, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Reflections Interactive", "publishers": "Coconuts Japan Entertainment", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.56", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistix", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBbkhqtxl3Y", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/7876-ballistix\n"}
