{"altername_name": [], "name": "Genji Tsuushin Agedama", "overview": "Based on the manga and anime of the same name, the titular hero Agedama goes into action to beat a monster clan led by an evil dragon. Each level works as an auto-runner (with the occasional platformer) that has the player attacking and dodging every monster that comes. Agedama can shoot projectiles, a roll maneuver or perform limited magic attacks. The kind of powers Agedama can use are dependent on the enemy pickups and the position of the indicator on the power gauge.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "December 13, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Red Company", "publishers": "NEC Home Electronics", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.48", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/24133-genji-tsuushin-agedama\n"}
