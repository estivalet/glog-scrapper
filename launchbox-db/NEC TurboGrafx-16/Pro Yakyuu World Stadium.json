The general gameplay as well as the graphics style closely resembles that of Namco's own \"Family Stadium/Famista\" baseball series for the Nintendo NES/Famicom. Game options include a one or two-player mode as well as watching two computer opponents play against each other. Players can choose from one of ten non-licensed teams. The game itself follows the standard formula of nearly all baseball games of its time, with having a 3rd-person view from behind the batter during the pitching/batting scenes and an overhead view of the field once the player hits the ball. Progress is saved via passwords given after each match.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "May 20, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Namco", "publishers": "Namco", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.3", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Stadium", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wqmx2MoRHmw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/29233-pro-yakyuu-world-stadium\n"}
