{"altername_name": [], "name": "Momotarou Katsugeki", "overview": "Momotaro Katsugeki (\"Momotaro Action Movie\") is a side-scrolling action-platformer from Hudson that uses their Momotaro character who is better known as the star of the Momotaro Dentetsu and Momotaro Densetsu series. It is a PC Engine exclusive and never saw international releases. Momotaro Katsugeki seems influenced by and plays similarly to Westone's Wonder Boy in Monster Land and the sequels that followed: the goal is to move across a set of 2D stages, and the player can talk to NPCs for hints and to purchase better equipment with the money they find. There is also a world map that links the various stages together.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "September 21, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hudson Soft", "publishers": "Hudson Soft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.8", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhsNa1jzVNU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/24136-momotarou-katsugeki\n"}
