{"altername_name": ["1943\u6539"], "name": "1943: Kai", "overview": "This is an enhanced version of 1943: The Battle of Midway, with most of the graphics and sounds reworked. There are also changes in the weapons and the inclusion of anachronical items such as laser-firing WWII planes and ships that run on the ground. The player controls a biplane Boeing Stearman E75 N68828 instead of the P-38. The PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16 adaptation adds some original levels to those from the arcade version, as well as animated intermissions.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "March 22, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Capcom", "publishers": "Naxat Soft", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.35", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1943:_The_Battle_of_Midway#1943_Kai", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12wjWPd1ZGM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/22596-1943-kai\n"}
