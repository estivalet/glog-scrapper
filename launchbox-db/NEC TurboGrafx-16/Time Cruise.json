{"altername_name": ["Time Cruise II"], "name": "Time Cruise", "overview": "Time Cruise is a pinball game from FACE with a sci-fi theme and multiple tables. Unlike most pinball games with extended play zones, these tables are to the left and right of the core table, and the pinball can switch between them by passing through connecting tunnels. In addition, the player can power up time machines by hitting several levers with the pinball. Entering a time machine takes the pinball to a number of different time zones, each providing a possible score boost or extra ball.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "November 8, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sankindo", "publishers": "FACE", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.89", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dGGAr6Vrfo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/7925-time-cruise\n"}
