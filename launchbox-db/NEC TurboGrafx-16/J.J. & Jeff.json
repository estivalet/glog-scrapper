Similar to Adventure Island, you must make your way through several levels, destroying wildlife along the way, but instead of using a hammer, you have three different ways to kill them: jump on or kick them, or when they are walking on the ground, blow gas out of them.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "November 30, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hudson Soft", "publishers": "Hudson Soft", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.92", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.J._%26_Jeff", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/7899-jj-jeff\n"}
