{"altername_name": ["F1 Circus '91: World Championship", "F1 Circus '91: World Championship", "F1 Circus '91: World Championship"], "name": "F1 Circus '91", "overview": "F1 Circus '91 is a Formula 1 simulation racing game. The series did not yet feature an official license, and so just like the first game it only features generic team and driver names. The game itself plays much the same, with the overhead race view and focus on car tuning and damage. The World Championship mode has of course returned, though the managerial Constructors mode is no longer present. There is also a Free Attack mode, where any course can be freely practiced; a Training mode, where special training courses can be raced on to learn the ins and outs of the game; and a Watch mode, where the player can choose a course and watch a demonstration race.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "July 12, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nihon Bussan", "publishers": "Nihon Bussan", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/54626-f1-circus-91\n"}
