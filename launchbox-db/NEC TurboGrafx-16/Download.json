{"altername_name": ["\u30c0\u30a6\u30f3\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9", "Down Load"], "name": "Download", "overview": "Download is a side-scrolling shooter. The player controls Syd on his flying bike, which acts, for all purposes, like other aircrafts in comparable games. Before each mission, the player selects one of the two available main weapons: vulcan cannon (spreading fire, up to five directions if powered-up), and laser beam (powerful, focused fire; beams are added with power-ups). The secondary weapons include homing missiles, a bomb-like gadget, and a shield - all with limited ammunition/energy. The stages include real-world locations as well as abstract \"computer-like\" virtual reality worlds, with geometrical figures and computer-related objects as enemies. Boss enemies usually guard the exit to each level, and utilize a variety of shooting patterns to stop the hero. Anime-style cut scenes advance the story between the missions.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "June 22, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "AlfaSystem", "publishers": "NEC Avenue", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.22", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/17832-download\n"}
