{"altername_name": ["KiKi KaiKai", "\u5947\u3005\u602a\u754c"], "name": "Kiki Kai Kai", "overview": "KiKi Kai Kai (\"Mysterious Ghost World\") is a scrolling shooter featuring the shrine maiden Sayo-chan as she fights a horde of youkai and oni in a quest to recover the Gods of Fortune. It is a precursor to the Pocky & Rocky games for the Super Nintendo. Sayo-chan/Pocky makes her way across various levels, changing directions occasionally, and using either a wand or scrolls to exorcise the unruly spirits she meets. She can only get hit once before dying, though some enemies will grab her instead to slow her down.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "March 27, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Pixel", "publishers": "Taito", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.17", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KiKi_KaiKai", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FCSmf8Mmk0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/53956-kiki-kai-kai\n"}
