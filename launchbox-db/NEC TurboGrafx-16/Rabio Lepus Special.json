It features numerous changes to accommodate the console, including the lack of a two-player mode. Therefore, despite the title, Lepus is not playable as this is a one player affair. The original Rabbit Punch Arcade game has been ported a few times - specifically by Hamster for their PS2 \"Oretachi Geesen Zoku Sono\" Arcade collection and later Arcade Archives series for PS4's PSN - yet this particular version has yet to see a rerelease.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "October 19, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Video System", "publishers": "Video System", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.98", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya4DNwwVo90", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/29138-rabio-lepus-special\n"}
