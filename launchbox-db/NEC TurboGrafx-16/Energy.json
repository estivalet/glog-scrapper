{"altername_name": [], "name": "Energy", "overview": "Energy is a side scrolling platform game by NCS/Masaya. It is based on Ashe, an obscure PC-8801 Japanese game originally released by Quasar Soft in 1988. A powerful earthquake has released an army of mutant monsters all over the city of Tokyo. A small group of humans survived and from their underground hideout they decide to send a team to investigate and fight the threat. The player takes control of a young fighter with psionic powers (called 'ESP'), the only known of his kind. He can use these unique phsychic powers to also fire balls of energy, his only means of defense against the various mutants and monsters that crawl around the levels. The player also meets many supportive characters throughout the game that offer clues about the overall story.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "April 19, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Quasar Soft", "publishers": "Masaya", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.05", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAm4ZD5tsKs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/34227-energy\n"}
