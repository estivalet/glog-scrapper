{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tongueman's Logic", "overview": "A clone of the addictive Picross, Tongueman's Logic presents you with a series of puzzle grids that have to be solved. Each grid has a set of numbers for the columns and rows, telling you how many black squares are there. By cross-referencing these numerical hints and using logic, you have to determine where in the grid they lie. You are able to place both black squares and 'clear' marks that help you keep track of squares that you know will be empty. There are 200 puzzles in total and as you progress the grid sizes get bigger and bigger, making the later ones quite challenging - given that you can only make a limited number of mistakes before it's Game Over.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "October 30, 2007", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "", "developers": "Chris Covell", "publishers": "", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.67", "wikipedia": "http://www.chrismcovell.com/TMLogic.html", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7ZIvHDbrWk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/125093-tonguemans-logic\n"}
