{"altername_name": [], "name": "Strip Fighter II", "overview": "Strip Fighter II is similar to Street Fighter II, but has a distinguishing feature: in this fighting game all the participants are attractive women. Players can choose one of six female characters. The player-controlled character must use her fighting and combat strengths to defeat the other five girls and a palette-swap of herself. The game has some fairly explicit content: during some moves the fighters would take their clothes off; after each fight the player is presented with a picture of female stripper.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Games Express", "publishers": "Games Express", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.91", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apKHlB0tHyc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/26905-strip-fighter-ii\n"}
