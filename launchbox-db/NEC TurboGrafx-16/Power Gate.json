{"altername_name": [], "name": "Power Gate", "overview": "Power Gate is a horizontal shoot 'em up developed by Make and published by Pack-in-Video. The game is a fairly standard example of its genre, with a handful of power-ups that include bombs for attacking ground targets, as well as more powerful weapons that can only be used once apiece. The player's fighter has three shield bars that lets them take three hits before being destroyed. These shield bars can be restored with certain power-ups as well.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "August 30, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Make Software", "publishers": "Pack-In-Video", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.45", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pO4PFhC8ELo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/71356-power-gate\n"}
