{"altername_name": ["Bonze Adventure", "\u5730\u7344\u3081\u3050\u308a"], "name": "Jigoku Meguri", "overview": "In this cute but spooky platformer, the player takes control of a small and completely bald Buddhist monk, the high priest bonze Kackremboh, who is on a perilous journey through the depths of Hell. Emma, the king of the underworld, has gone mad and our hero's mission is to stop him and his minions. The monk can use his magical powers and shoot bouncing marbles which curiously look like large Malas (traditional Hindu and Buddhist prayer beads). They come in different colors, each of which represents a specific power - red for fire, purple for lightening and so forth.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "August 3, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "ITL", "publishers": "Taito", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.19", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonze_Adventure", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/17839-jigoku-meguri\n"}
