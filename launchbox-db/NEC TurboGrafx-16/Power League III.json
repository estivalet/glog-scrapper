It features fictional teams and players and includes All-Star, Pennant and Open modes, as well as a non-competitive Home Run Derby mode. It received various minor enhancements and additions from Power League II, including more realistic and easier to catch flyballs and graphical variation in the batters to help distinguish them from one another. The Power League series would see three more sequels for the PC Engine before jumping ship to the Super Famicom. Only the first game in the series, World Class Baseball, would ever see a US localization.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "August 10, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Now Production", "publishers": "Hudson Soft", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "2.08", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56BfBOuFoiU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/71358-power-league-iii\n"}
