{"altername_name": ["Doragon Seiba", "Dragon Saber: After Story of Dragon Spirit"], "name": "Dragon Saber", "overview": "Whereas Dragon Spirit was a multi-format conversion, only Turbo-Grafx / PC Engine users initially got to play the lesser-known sequel at home. Gameplay-wise, little has changed from the original, as both games are vertically-scrolling shoot 'em ups putting you in control of a dragon. You are flying over built-up land, complete with rivers and their banks. The enemies and waves can be shot or avoided - shooting them reveals extra points as well as the occasional power-up. Ground units are shooting at you but can't be shot back, so be careful which parts of the screen you occupy at which times. The game now supports two-player simultaneous gameplay: Huey, the blue dragon, and Siria, the red dragon, are player one and player two respectively.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "December 27, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Now Production", "publishers": "Namco", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.51", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Saber", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/32566-dragon-saber\n"}
