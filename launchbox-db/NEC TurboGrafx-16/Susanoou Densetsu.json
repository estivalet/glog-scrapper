The player controls Susano-o in his awakened form and travels a post-apocalyptic world to track down and defeat the demons who had caused the world's end. While in towns the player can talk to NPCs, acquire quests, rest at inns and purchase items and equipment from vendors. On the world map between locations, the player can see monsters roaming around (not unlike Zelda II: The Adventure of Link) and will enter combat if they get too close. These fights are entirely tactical and require that the player move around an invisible grid and use the fight command on enemies in range; as the player levels up, they will gain more action points and will be able to attack and move more often per turn.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "April 27, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "AlfaSystem", "publishers": "Hudson Soft", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.44", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O0tMxVGF0w", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/71398-susanoou-densetsu\n"}
