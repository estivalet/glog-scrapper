{"altername_name": ["\u9752\u3044\u30d6\u30ea\u30f3\u30af", "Blue Blink"], "name": "Aoi Blink", "overview": "Based on a TV anime series (from the grandfather of manga Osamu Tezuka), Blue Blink is a cute platformer that manages to find its place among the crowd. The game is divided up into different areas, each represented by a map screen. Within these areas, you can choose your route to the end (by exiting levels at certain points). Throughout each area you have to find a 'master key' allowing you access to the boss - this can be hard to locate at times and requires lots of shooting at blank areas of screen just in case. Control of your character is original - on each stage you have three characters which you can choose between, with the CPU controlled ones following behind you like some bizarre congo line. The characters are preset and vary from stage to stage, and each one has different attributes. For example, some have very high jumping ability, whereas others are poor at jumping but have spread-shot weapons. Once you have found the master key and reached the final level in the area, you are entered into a boss battle, where you sit astride the titular donkey and attempt to fight your way to the next area.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "April 27, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Westone", "publishers": "Hudson Soft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.77", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwZbCGPvayA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/19609-aoi-blink\n"}
