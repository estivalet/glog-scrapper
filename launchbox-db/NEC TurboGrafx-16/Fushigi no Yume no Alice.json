You adventure through forests, caves, castles and such, defeating the many enemies by letting out a loud scream that shoots across the screen. The scream can be powered up by holding down the button, but leave it too long and you'll get out of breath and stand there panting, defenseless for a few moments. Aside from your voice, you can also jump on enemies to dispatch them. As you progress through the stages (each with a boss at the end of course) you also gain magic powers in the form of books. By pushing RUN then selecting your power with BUTTON I, you get the chance to do such things as show hidden power-ups and become invincible for a short time.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "December 19, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sankindo", "publishers": "FACE", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.21", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYjQY6McqSY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/30121-fushigi-no-yume-no-alice\n"}
