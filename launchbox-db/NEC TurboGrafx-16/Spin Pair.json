Instead of just matching block colours, you also have to fill in the blocks by rotating their \u2018full\u2019 half so it matches the \u2018empty\u2019 half of the shape below. As levels progress, blocks represent different things like plants, animals etc to give some variety. There are several modes of play, including a story mode and link-up.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "December 14, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Media Rings", "publishers": "Media Rings", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yL2L_NukshQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/29066-spin-pair\n"}
