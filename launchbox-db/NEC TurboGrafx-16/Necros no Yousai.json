{"altername_name": ["\u30cd\u30af\u30ed\u30b9\u306e\u8981\u585e"], "name": "Necros no Yousai", "overview": "Necros no Yousai, or Neclos no Yousai, (\"Fortress of Neclos/Necros\") is a traditional Japanese RPG that was released exclusively on the PC Engine. It is based on the toyline of the same name, which was one of many brands of \"shokugan\" or \"food toys\" - small figurines packaged with candy that were intended for children. The toyline featured the evil sorcerer Neclos/Necros, the eight heroic champions sent to defeat him and Neclos/Necros's various henchmonsters. The game controls like a standard RPG and alternates between a top-down view for talking to NPCs and exploring towns and dungeons and a first-person view for its turn-based combat. The various characters launch into little animated vignettes whenever they attack, and each of the heroes has strengths and weaknesses specific to their class which the player can build strategies around.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "April 20, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Adventure Planning Service", "publishers": "ASK Kodansha", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8ihL0AfpHg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/70271-necros-no-yousai\n"}
