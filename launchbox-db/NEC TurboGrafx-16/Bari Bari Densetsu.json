{"altername_name": ["\u30d0\u30ea\u30d0\u30ea\u4f1d\u8aac"], "name": "Bari Bari Densetsu", "overview": "Based on a manga, Bari Bari Densetsu is something of a rare breed on the Engine - a motorcycle racing game. You can pretty much guess how it works - there's a World GP mode where you have to compete in a variety of races in order and a Travel mode that let's you pick a track of your choice. Also to consider is the gubbins that make up your bike, such as tyres, engine, brakes etc as these have an effect depending on the type of course and the weather conditions. Races are started with a qualifying lap that lets you get the feel of the track, followed by the race proper. You are then placed and can hopefully move on to the next country.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "November 29, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Taito", "publishers": "Taito", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.08", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baribari_Legend", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNOpp4QJ4Vo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/19620-bari-bari-densetsu\n"}
