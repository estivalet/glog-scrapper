There are five modes in the game: \u2022 Versus Mode has two players facing each other in one game. \u2022 Open Mode is similar to Versus, but playing against the computer instead of a human player. \u2022 Pennant Mode takes the player to the baseball tournament, facing and challenging opposing teams, one after another. \u2022 All Star Mode enables the player to pick players for a team based on performance in a single game. \u2022 Home Run Mode allows the player to have a go at batting and score a run. The player is also free to edit the All Star team members in any order and change their names.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "August 8, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Now Production", "publishers": "Hudson Soft", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.21", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGO72qayO40", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/31025-power-league-ii\n"}
