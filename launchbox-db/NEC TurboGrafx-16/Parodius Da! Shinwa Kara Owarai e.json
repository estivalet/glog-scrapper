Shinwa Kara Owarai e", "overview": "Konami's imaginative parody on the Gradius series. It plays just like Gradius, with the same power-up system, but features a far more bizarre and imaginative series of levels and characters. This game was released in Japan for the PC Engine and is a port of the Arcade original with a couple of differences: it doesn't have the arcade Stages 5 and 8, but features a stage titled SPECIAL and a new introduction that features several strange-looking Japanese characters. This is in contrast to the arcade intro, which chronicles the Gradius legacy up until the time of release.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "February 21, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.31", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parodius!_From_Myth_to_Laughter", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3FS_VWakpo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/18292-parodius-da-shinwa-kara-owarai-e\n"}
