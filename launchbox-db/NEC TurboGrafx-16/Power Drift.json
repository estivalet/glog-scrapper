Watch the dust fly and the wheels spin as you screech over a roller coaster track and wave goodbye to your opponents. Roar over mounds of mud, drive through the desert, slip 'n' slide on snow-covered tarmac and race your way through the night to face the final lap! CAREFUL! Power Drift is no easy ride! If you're heading for a collision hold on to your seat and enjoy those 360 degree spins before you bump back down to earth!", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "April 13, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Copya System", "publishers": "Asmik Ace Entertainment", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.29", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Drift", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aZL2eEz4eU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/71306-power-drift\n"}
