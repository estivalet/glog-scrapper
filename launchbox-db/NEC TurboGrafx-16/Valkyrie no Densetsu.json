Traverse swamps, canyons, castles and caves armed with your sword that fires upgrade able bolts of energy from its tip. The action also includes a few puzzles and there are some original ideas (like the level where you have to catapult yourself from one place to another). The PC Engine version of the game sports a big number of differences that almost make it a new game; the stage design has been changed, new stages have been added, the players are given passwords to save their progress, there is a new extra boss battle before the players fight the last boss (Kamuzu), and the ending is completely different from that of the arcade version (however, like many other Namco PC Engine conversions, the graphics and sound are inferior to that of the arcade version due to the fact that it is an 8-bit console).", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "August 9, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Namco", "publishers": "Namco", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.36", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valkyrie_no_Densetsu", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvFVjUsAIsk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21759-valkyrie-no-densetsu\n"}
