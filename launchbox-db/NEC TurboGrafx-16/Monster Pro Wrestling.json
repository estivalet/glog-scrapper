{"altername_name": ["Monster Puroresu"], "name": "Monster Pro Wrestling", "overview": "Monster Pro Wrestling is a 1991 wrestling game exclusive to the PC Engine. It features various monster wrestlers, some of which are based on classical monsters like zombies, werewolves and mummies. The story of the game involves monster wrestlers summoned by a demon to conquer the Earth, and a human scientist who creates his own mutant wrestler to combat them in the ring. Rather than an action game, the player hits a button to stop a rolling dice and their opponent does the same. This determines the initial balance of power between the two, and then both players have to spam the attack button to move a gauge closer in their favor. Shortly thereafter, a cutscene plays to show the result of the face off, usually with one opponent taking a lot of damage. The player is able to distribute points to their wrestler's stats between bouts to boost their chances of winning.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "November 22, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Lenar", "publishers": "ASK Kodansha", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.6", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/31827-monster-pro-wrestling\n"}
