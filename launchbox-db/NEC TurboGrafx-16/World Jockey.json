{"altername_name": [], "name": "World Jockey", "overview": "World Jockey is a horseracing game that is part of the World series of sports games developed by Namco for the PC Engine and the Arcade. Rather than the many simulation-heavy games in the genre, which has players managing every aspect of their stable and jockeys between automated races, the player is actively racing a horse themselves. The game can support up to four simultaneous players at once. There is also a \"ticket\" mode that allows players to instead bet on the outcome of an automated race.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "September 20, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Namco", "publishers": "Namco", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.92", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYGqzOrjXQw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/71415-world-jockey\n"}
