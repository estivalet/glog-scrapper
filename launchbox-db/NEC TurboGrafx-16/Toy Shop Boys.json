The evil Gamma has stolen all the toys and keeps them in his protected castle. The player takes control of a group of three flying kids. They have decided to defeat the baddies and get to Gamma's fortress. Only one kid can be used at the same time though and each one of the has his own set of weapons and skills which include rotating sword, vulcan gun and Boomerangs. As usual, special items can be collected on the way, enhancing they weaponary or activating special features such as short invulnerability or smart-bombs capable of destroying everything on the screen. Enemies are, as you would have guessed, evil toys varying from plastic ducks to electric trains and flying saucers. The game counts five long levels and a two (sadly non-simulataneous) player mode is available.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "December 14, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mutech", "publishers": "Victor Entertainment", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.59", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpHjXOSCpS0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/71402-toy-shop-boys\n"}
