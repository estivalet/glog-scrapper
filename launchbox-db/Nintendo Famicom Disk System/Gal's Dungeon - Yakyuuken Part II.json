{"name": "Gal's Dungeon: Yakyuuken Part II", "overview": "Gal's Dungeon is an adult unlicensed Famicom Disk System game by Super Pig. You play as private eye Kogorou Kurachi, tasked with rescuing the daughter of a crime syndicate boss from the mysterious \"Phantom of 40 Faces\". It's a 3D dungeon game, similar to the mazes in Wizardry and other terrible computer RPGs, where you progress through eight floors of the villain's master hideout to the thrilling final showdown! Each floor has a female guardian, whom you must play rock-paper-scissors against. If you win, you get the key to the next floor. You can pick up maps and compasses to guide your way, but always be wary for hidden traps and secret clues! Kogorou Kurachi is the designers' little parody of the Japanese fictional detective Kogoro Akechi, often considered the Japanese counterpart to Sherlock Holmes. His most frequent nemesis was the master criminal, the Fiend with Twenty Faces. So there's some history for you.", "platform": "Nintendo Famicom Disk System", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Super Pig", "publishers": "Super Pig", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.86", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/43541\n"}
