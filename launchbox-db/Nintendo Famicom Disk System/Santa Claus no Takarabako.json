{"name": "Santa Claus no Takarabako", "overview": "Santa Claus no Takarabako is a simulator that allows the user to create custom sprite-based Christmas cards. The player can select a message, modify a walking sprite of Santa Claus and choose a background image and music to accompany the message. The secondary mode provides various random generators for gambling games, such as a quintet of dice for Yahtzee (a.k.a. Dice Poker), a spinning roulette wheel or a bingo sheet. The game does not track progress, so the players themselves must be responsible for any scorekeeping. The four games are Poker Dice, Roulette, Slot Machine, and Bingo.", "platform": "Nintendo Famicom Disk System", "release_date": "December 4, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Musical Plan Ltd.", "publishers": "Data East", "genres": "Casino", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.07", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/52433\n"}
