{"name": "Electrician", "overview": "The player character is a young electrician called Richard Light. He must install electrical wiring in apartment buildings in various American cities. In each building, Richard navigates service corridors to link the electrical wires between each room, As he does so, animals threaten to chew through the wires. When an electrical connection is complete, the live wires illuminate the connected rooms and electrocute the \"enemy\" animals on contact. If Richard touches any of the rats, bats, or giant insects in the corridor, he loses a life. In the buildings, the player earns points by illuminating rooms and electrocuting any rats, bats, and insects. Occasionally, a burglar appears; intercepting him rewards the player with bonus points and a bell, which is worth a 1-up. After wiring all the rooms in an apartment building, the player exits and navigates a dark sewer to the next building. In the sewer, the player must avoid turtles and green slimes. A flashlight reveals hidden walls.", "platform": "Nintendo Famicom Disk System", "release_date": "December 26, 1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kemco", "publishers": "Kemco", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.33", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrician_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc9o7bnY-M0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/49941\n"}
