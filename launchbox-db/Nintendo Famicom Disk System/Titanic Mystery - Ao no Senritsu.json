The FDS version received more of a backstory including a small manga included with the instruction booklet. The goal is to explore the HMS Titanic and find some way to bring it to the surface. Between diving sequences, where the main blonde diver character explores the sunken ship, the player must contend with procuring financial backing and ensure that the investors involved with the project are content with its progress. The subtitle \"Ao no Senritsu\" roughly translates to \"Melody of Blue\".", "platform": "Nintendo Famicom Disk System", "release_date": "July 24, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gakken", "publishers": "Gakken", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/43671\n"}
