{"name": "Meikyuu Jiin Dababa", "overview": "The game takes place in India, where a young man's significant-other is kidnapped by an evil wizard. He must then tackle the four areas of the labyrinth temple of Dababa to rescue her. In order to accomplish this task, the player cannot simple move across the floor. Rather, the player and all of the enemies hop from one square tile to another, throughout the game. In a majority of stages, the player must uncover the seals which will unlock the door to the next stage by leaping on to the particular tiles which keep the seals concealed. Not every door will take the player forward, however, as some doors are trick doors that may take the player to a previous stage. In some stages, the player must simply survive the onslaught of enemies, while in others, the player is racing against the clock.", "platform": "Nintendo Famicom Disk System", "release_date": "May 29, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.58", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meikyuu_Jiin_Dababa", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXGEBwKel2Q", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/43297\n"}
