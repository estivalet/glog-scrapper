They ambush you at every turn, pushing you off the road, leaping into your path. You outsmart them, firing an arsenal of oil cans you've collected in the road, knocking them out and racking up more points. Cover every stretch of the highway in order to hit the next city. You can make it. Or can you?", "platform": "Nintendo Famicom Disk System", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hect", "publishers": "Hangsing", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_Connection", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/100688\n"}
