{"name": "Knight Move", "overview": "Knight Move is a chess-based puzzle/strategy game from famed Tetris creator Alexey Pajitnov in which the player has to traverse a chessboard using a knight's erratic L-shaped movement to collect hearts. While collecting hearts, the player may stand on the same square up to three times - after which the square disappears. These pitfalls will instantly end the game if the knight lands on them, but at the same time are the only way to score points: Collecting the heart will repair any holes and award points for each one, after which the heart moves to a new space and the game continues. The knight is always moving towards the spot indicated by the player (or to a random default square if the player hasn't acted) and will continue to move faster as the game progresses. This makes it less easy to plan out moves ahead of time and, eventually, difficult to aim the knight in the desired direction before the next move occurs. There is also a harder mode: Type B. In this mode the player must collect numerous hearts before the board's gaps are repaired and each heart has a timer: this is the number of moves the knight can make before the heart vanishes and a new one appears elsewhere.", "platform": "Nintendo Famicom Disk System", "release_date": "June 5, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "JV Dialog", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.12", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_Move", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOu4A9l6Wh4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/43290\n"}
