{"name": "Exciting Basket", "overview": "Exciting Basket is a basketball game for one or two players. You can select different time limits for games, select teams, and begin playing! Gameplay is entirely action, so no time needs to be spent customizing the teams or with statistics. You control each player on the team one at a time (the player with or about to receive the ball will be human controlled, with the computer taking over the other players temporarily.) Some versions feature a small amount of digitized sound effects, and close ups of slam dunks.", "platform": "Nintendo Famicom Disk System", "release_date": "July 24, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.9", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Dribble_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQz4hYylZDY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/49939\n"}
