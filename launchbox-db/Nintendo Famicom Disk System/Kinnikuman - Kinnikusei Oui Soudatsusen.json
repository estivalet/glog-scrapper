{"name": "Kinnikuman: Kinnikusei Oui Soudatsusen", "overview": "Kinnikuman: Kinnikusei Oui Soudatsusen is a wrestling game based on the popular toy line, manga and anime about a klutzy superhero who fights most of his opponents with professional wrestling moves. The first Kinnikuman game (released as M.U.S.C.L.E. in the US) was a straightforward wrestling game, but this sequel changes the action to a side-scrolling action brawler game with additional RPG and story elements. The main character can still use wrestling moves on enemies, but most of the attacks are simple punches and kicks. Curiously, the boss music is a sped up version of \"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida\" by Iron Butterfly.", "platform": "Nintendo Famicom Disk System", "release_date": "May 1, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bandai", "publishers": "Bandai", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.28", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-N3QsH9mhQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/50608\n"}
