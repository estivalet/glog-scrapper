{"name": "Final Commando: Akai Yousai", "overview": "This earlier version of the game we known as Jackal in the west lacks some of the content that were later added to its NES counterpart, due to the fact that it was released in disk card format rather than on a ROM cartridge. Namely, the stages in the FDS versions scrolls vertically only, have different layouts and are much shorter as a result. The beach stage is not featured in the FDS version and thus, the ruins (Stage 2 in the NES version) serves as the introductory stage instead.", "platform": "Nintendo Famicom Disk System", "release_date": "May 2, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackal_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VLnwgbgCbE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/53530\n"}
