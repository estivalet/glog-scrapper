{"name": "Roger Rabbit", "overview": "Help Roger Rabbit collect hearts in various levels and save Jessica Rabbit while avoiding the dastardly weasels! This was eventually released in the US as Bugs Bunny's Crazy Castle and changed the hearts to carrots and the weasels into various characters from Looney Tunes. This was due to Kemco losing the rights to Roger Rabbit in the US. While presented in a side-scroller format, Roger Rabbit differed from standard side-scrollers such as Super Mario Bros. in that Roger Rabbit did not have a jump function; therefore, only by taking different routes could Roger avoid enemies. Some of the levels had boxing gloves, invincibility potions, safes, crates, flower pots, or ten-pound weights that could be used against the enemies in the game. As a result, the game had a \"puzzle-solving\" atmosphere. Players score 100 points for every carrot with the last one in each floor giving the player an extra life, 100 points for every enemy defeated using invincibility bottles, 500 points per enemy using boxing glove and 1000 points per enemy that gets hit with heavy objects.", "platform": "Nintendo Famicom Disk System", "release_date": "February 16, 1989", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kemco", "publishers": "Kemco", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.17", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_Castle_(series)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5y0TdluMWLE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/53760\n"}
