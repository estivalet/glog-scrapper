{"name": "Super Boy Allan", "overview": "In the game, Allan Colada journeys from his home in the foothills into the mountains to retrieve a remedy for his sister Leela's fever. Super Boy Allan is the second game in Sunsoft's \"Intelligence Game\" edutainment series for the Famicom Disk System, featuring two different game modes. The first game mode, which is also the main game, the player has to avoid contact with enemies and push logs in order to solve math-based problems to get extra items. Solving math problems also increases your ability to move several logs at once, which is needed to make further progress. The second, and much simpler game mode, has the player to finish a 39-steps marathon run by correctly answering simple math questions to accumulate as many points as possible.", "platform": "Nintendo Famicom Disk System", "release_date": "March 27, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sunsoft", "publishers": "Sunsoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Boy_Allan", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cPWteJvxPQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/43546\n"}
