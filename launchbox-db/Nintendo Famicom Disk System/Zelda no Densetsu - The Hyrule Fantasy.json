{"name": "Zelda no Densetsu: The Hyrule Fantasy", "overview": "A small kingdom in the land of Hyrule, the setting of the game, is engulfed in chaos after an army led by Ganon, the Prince of Darkness, invaded it and stole the Triforce of Power, a part of a magical artifact bestowing great strength. In an attempt to prevent Ganon from acquiring the Triforce of Wisdom, another of the pieces, Princess Zelda splits it and hides the eight fragments in secret dungeons throughout the land. Before the princess is eventually kidnapped by Ganon, she commands her nursemaid Impa to find someone courageous enough to save the kingdom. While wandering the land, the old woman is surrounded by Ganon's henchmen, though a young boy named Link appears and rescues her. After hearing Impa's plea, he resolves to save Zelda and sets out to reassemble the scattered fragments of the Triforce of Wisdom, to become powerful enough to defeat Ganon.", "platform": "Nintendo Famicom Disk System", "release_date": "February 21, 1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nintendo R&D4", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.47", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFfk5onbxjw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/41920\n"}
