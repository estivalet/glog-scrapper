{"name": "Chitei Tairiku Ordola", "overview": "Chitei Tairiku Ordola (\"Underground Continent Ordola\") is a Famicom Disk System action platformer from SunSoft and the third part of their Chinou Game Series, each borrowing an existing NES game's model (in Ordola's case, Atlantis no Nazo) and adding arithmetic problems to it. In Ordola, the actual math puzzles are relegated to an ancillary mini-game found on the disk. The goal of the game is to help a young explorer pass through the underground world of Ordola, taking out enemies along the way with his bombs. The bombs fly in a specific arc, so the player needs to be the right distance from the enemy in order to hit it. The player character can also crouch, jump, climb ladders and use other abilities common to platformers.", "platform": "Nintendo Famicom Disk System", "release_date": "March 27, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "ASK Kodansha", "publishers": "Sunsoft", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40534\n"}
