{"name": "Kick and Run", "overview": "Kick and Run is a soccer game from Taito which was originally released in the Arcades and later ported to the Famicom Disk System a couple years later. It uses a side perspective which would later be usurped by the more popular vertical view, and later again by the isometric perspective favored by the early FIFA games. Kick and Run has something of a personality to set it apart from similar games. This includes cheerleaders during the half-time show (generally not featured in soccer matches, unlike football) and how goalkeepers will irritably kick the goalpost if the rival team scores.", "platform": "Nintendo Famicom Disk System", "release_date": "September 13, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Taito", "publishers": "Taito", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.6", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTJNzW9vCb8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/50603\n"}
