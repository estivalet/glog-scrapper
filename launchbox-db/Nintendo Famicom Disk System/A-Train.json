{"name": "A-Train", "overview": "The first game in the A-Ressha de Ikou (\"Let's Take the A-Train\") series, which would eventually become known overseas as A-Train. The goal of the game is to build a prosperous railroad company. Unlike the second (Railroad Empire) and third (A-Train) games in the series, the original A-Ressha de Ikou never saw an international release. Some of the games influenced by later entries in this series include the SimCity series (and in turn the wider Sim/Sims franchise) and the Railroad Tycoon series (and in turn, the wider Sid Meier franchise). A-Ressha de Ikou may not have been the first railroad simulation, however, as it was anticipated by the relatively obscure Squaresoft game Amtrack, which released just months before it.", "platform": "Nintendo Famicom Disk System", "release_date": "December 1, 1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Artdink Corp.", "publishers": "Artdink Corp.", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-Train#A-Train", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFlXl2mLOPY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/157193\n"}
