{"name": "German Tanteidan MarinGumi: Maruhi Jigomar Sousa File", "overview": "German Tanteidan MarinGumi: Maruhi Jigomar Sousa File (also known as Jaaman Tanteidan: Matonarikumi) is an adventure game from Bandai that uses the license of a TV show that was also the basis of Bandai's earlier action game Omoikkiri Tanteidan Haado Gumi: Matenrou no Chousenjou. Both games feature teams of schoolchildren detectives as they hunt down an elusive thief in a mask and cape. The game follows a sub-genre of Japanese adventure games that include a top-down RPG style world map to walk around on, rather than simply selecting destinations from a menu. Otherwise the game is similar to other NES Portopia/Tantei Club-derived detective adventure games; the player must search for clues, talk to witnesses and suspects and solve inventory-based puzzles in order to proceed.", "platform": "Nintendo Famicom Disk System", "release_date": "November 29, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bandai", "publishers": "Bandai", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/52434\n"}
