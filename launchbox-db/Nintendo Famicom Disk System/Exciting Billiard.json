{"name": "Exciting Billiard", "overview": "You're an aspiring billiards player. Your dream is to become the American pool champion. But there are seven top pool sharks ready to turn your dream into a nightmare. And they're scattered all over the country and waiting for your challenge. Sharpen up your cue stick - it's time to hustle your way to glory! In Exciting Billiard, the player's goal is to defeat seven billiards masters scattered all across the USA and become the champion. Starting in New York, the player works his/her way through the Bronx, Chicago, Las Vegas, Florida, and Beverly Hills, before the final match back in New York with Hustler Master. However, it's not enough to beat them - the player must also score enough cash to move on to the next hustler. The game can be played in one of four ways - the traditional break shot, nine ball, rotation, or a rack game. In a rack game, up to four players can play.", "platform": "Nintendo Famicom Disk System", "release_date": "June 26, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.88", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LQITFfI4hc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/49940\n"}
