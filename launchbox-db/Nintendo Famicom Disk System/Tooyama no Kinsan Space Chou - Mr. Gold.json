{"name": "Tooyama no Kinsan Space Chou: Mr. Gold", "overview": "Tooyama no Kinsan Space Chou: Mr. Gold (Mr Gold: Kinsan in the Space) is an adventure game based on an anime OVA Touyama Sakura Uchuu Chou: Yatsu no Na wa Gold (or simply Samurai Gold) which in turn is loosely based on real-life samurai Touyama Kagemoto. It features a space hero with a cherry blossom tattoo who fights crimes across the cosmos. This character archetype is usually attributed to fictional adaptations of the Touyama Kagemoto legend, though rarely with a Ziggy Stardust sci-fi theme. The game plays much like any other NES text adventure: The player is presented with a window of what the main character can see and is given options in various menus for what the player can do at any given moment, such as pick up nearby objects or talk to nearby people. Much of the game is spent following co-ordinates to different locations and discovering where to go next.", "platform": "Nintendo Famicom Disk System", "release_date": "July 19, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Toei Animation", "publishers": "Toei Animation", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u33PS9tGNvk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/43301\n"}
