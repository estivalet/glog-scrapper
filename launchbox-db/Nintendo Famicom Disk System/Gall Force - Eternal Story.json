{"name": "Gall Force: Eternal Story", "overview": "Gall Force: Eternal Story is a game that tells an additional tale from the Gall Force anime series, a series which revolves around a galactic battle between the all-female Solnoids and the race known as the Paranoids. This game tells the story of Rabby, the second-in-command of the space cruiser Star Leaf, having to rescue her six crew mates and also destroy the fortress of the Paranoids. The game is a vertical scrolling shoot-'em-up. Players start by flying over the surface of the planet Terra, dodging and destroying enemies until they reach a set of launchers. Each launcher launches the player's ship into a different section of outer space. Each section features more shoot-em' up action until at the end a boss enemy appears. Defeating the boss enemy of a space section will release one the kidnapped crew members from bondage and allow them to rejoin back onto the Star Leaf crew.", "platform": "Nintendo Famicom Disk System", "release_date": "December 10, 1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "HAL Laboratory", "publishers": "HAL Laboratory", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.82", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gall_Force#Video_games", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwLXKi7cq9k", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/43202\n"}
