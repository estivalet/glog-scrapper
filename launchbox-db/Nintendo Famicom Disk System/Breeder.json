{"name": "Breeder", "overview": "Breeder is a sort of fighting game featuring automated fighting robots designed by the player. The action takes place in the distant future and to improve the quality of their war-robots, a star civilization decides to organize special tournaments. Those \"metal combats\" are held in arenas where two robots fight against each other in a death match. A vast list of components can be edited and customized from the start and the game counts seven different types of robots ( 2 legs, 4 legs, snake, hover, 3 tires, 6 tires and Belt). 1000 points are given to the player and they need to be strategically spent over fifteen abilities - from speed, dexterity to luck and IQ. When the player robot is ready, it can be activated and fight in a special arena. However, the fight is totally controlled by the CPU - so the player just sits down and watch the action until his robot wins, or loses. Up to eight robots can be saved on the Disk Card.", "platform": "Nintendo Famicom Disk System", "release_date": "December 15, 1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Soft Pro International", "publishers": "Soft Pro International", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/41183\n"}
