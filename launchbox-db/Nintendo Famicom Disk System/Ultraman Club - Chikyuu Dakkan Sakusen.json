The concept behind the \"Ultraman Club\" was to consolidate all the different variants of Ultraman from his many appearances in the different shows and have the player control a party of them. Unlike the two prior games, which were more action-oriented, this game is a turn-based RPG. Players can also select each scenario from the title screen, choosing to play them in whichever order they wish.", "platform": "Nintendo Famicom Disk System", "release_date": "October 22, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Interlink", "publishers": "Bandai", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.78", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/49938\n"}
