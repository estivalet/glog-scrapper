{"name": "Adian No Tsue", "overview": "Adian No Tsue is not a traditional adventure game - It is most and foremost an educational game designed to appeal to a young audience. It is also the first installment of a series of games released in Japan by SunSoft. The player takes control of a courageous knight and the game follows a traditional overhead display which somehow bears some resemblance to Nintendo's Zelda. Each room is usually filled up with monsters and four doors lead to other surrounding rooms, different locations or just hide special items. However, the only way for our hero to pass these doors is to solve simple arithmetic equations. Numbers from 0 to 9 appear on two sides of the room and the knight must run around the room and touch them to display the right answer. Yet, these expressions are very simple and only use simple additions, subtractions, multiplications and divisions. Nonetheless, solving them while running around the rooms and hitting crazy skeletons with a sword can be a challenging task. The other side of the disk contains a simple marathon game also based on arithmetic challenges.", "platform": "Nintendo Famicom Disk System", "release_date": "December 12, 1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "ASK Kodansha", "publishers": "Sunsoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.35", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObahVqBE6R0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40301\n"}
