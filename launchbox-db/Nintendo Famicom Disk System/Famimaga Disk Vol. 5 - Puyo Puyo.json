{"name": "Famimaga Disk Vol. 5: Puyo Puyo", "overview": "Puyo Puyo is the first entry of Compile's Puyo Puyo series. It was released on the MSX and Famicom Disk System on October 25, 1991; the FDS version was published by Tokuma Shoten as part of their \"Famimaga Disk\" line of games. The FDS version would later be released on a Famicom cart in 1993. Puyo Puyo would be succeeded by a much more popular arcade game of the same name. Puyo Puyo contains three modes: Endless, Mission, and Verses. In Endless Mode, players match Puyo until the top of their well is filled. If the player chooses, either a giant 2x2 green Puyo or Carbucle will periodically help the player clear space on their board. Mission mode gives the player several challenges to complete, such as clearing a set amount of Puyo or clearing all Puyo of a certain color. Verses mode allows players to battle each other.", "platform": "Nintendo Famicom Disk System", "release_date": "October 25, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Compile", "publishers": "Tokuma Shoten", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.17", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puyo_Puyo", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0g0Cxu_vSc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/53534\n"}
