{"name": "Fairytale", "overview": "Fairytale is a turn-based war strategy game that takes place in an archetypal fairytale world. The player and their units must fight off an invasion of pigs by encountering them on the map and fighting in strategic battles where the opponent and player commit to a course of action and watch both sides move and act simultaneously. In this respect the challenge is not only out-maneuvering their opponent but also correctly predicting their next plan of attack and reacting ahead of time.", "platform": "Nintendo Famicom Disk System", "release_date": "April 28, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Soft Pro International", "publishers": "Soft Pro International", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/41772\n"}
