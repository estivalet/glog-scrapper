{"name": "Knight Lore", "overview": "Our hero must reach Melkhior, a somewhat eccentric wizard who is the only one who can save him. As with most Ultimate titles of the day, reaching him is a long and treacherous challenge, involving both puzzle-solving and action, meaning that each screen requires thorough planning and precise navigation. The game uses the isometric viewpoint in a manner similar to the later Head Over Heels, using monochrome (save for the Famicom conversion) but detailed graphics and techniques to avoid flickering sprites. The game lasts for 40 days and nights - at night your character turns into a werewolf. Ultimate's individual style of eschewing straightforward instructions in favor of feature lists and riddles is put to good use here, with the story detailed in a rhyming poem of sorts. The Famicom version was produced by and published by Jaleco.", "platform": "Nintendo Famicom Disk System", "release_date": "December 19, 1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jaleco", "publishers": "Jaleco", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.14", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_Lore", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g7rMly1_8I", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/71874\n"}
