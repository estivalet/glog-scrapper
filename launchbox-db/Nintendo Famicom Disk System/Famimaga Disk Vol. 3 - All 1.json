{"name": "Famimaga Disk Vol. 3: All 1", "overview": "All One, or Famimaga Disk Vol. 3: All One, is a puzzle game in which the player controls a ladybug pushing over dice. The goal of each stage is to push all the dice onto their side so that their \"one\" side is facing upwards. The player is given a smaller first-person view window from the ladybug's perspective to allow them to see the sides of each die and plan out their strategy. As with other block-pushing puzzle games, the game becomes similar to Sokoban or Adventures of Lolo in its complexity as it progresses: there is often only a few (or just one) paths to successfully solving a stage and the player will need to restart if they make a mistake.", "platform": "Nintendo Famicom Disk System", "release_date": "February 22, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tokuma Shoten", "publishers": "Tokuma Shoten", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbHIHba8mTk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/53533\n"}
