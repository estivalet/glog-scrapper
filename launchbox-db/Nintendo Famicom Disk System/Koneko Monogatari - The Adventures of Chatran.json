{"name": "Koneko Monogatari: The Adventures of Chatran", "overview": "This game is inspired by the Japanese movie Koneko Monogatari (known in the west as The Adventures of Milo and Otis). Players control the feline Chatran as he tries to return home to the farm he got separated from so that he can reunite with his girlfriend. The game contains 24 different side-scrolling stages. Every two stages counts as a month of time, with one stage counting as daytime and the other as nighttime. The main goal of each stage is to dodge enemies and get to end of the stage unhurt and within the time limit. Although Chatran cannot directly attack enemies, he's not totally defenseless. He can drop any eggs that he has picked up onto his enemies to dispose of them. Chatran can find these eggs plus other items like fruit by jumping into tree leaves thus shaking the items loose. Collecting 50 pieces of fruit will earn Chatran an extra life. There are also eggs that contain letters on them. Spelling out the word HELP will summon Chatran's canine companion Poosky, who can defeat any enemies that gets in his way.", "platform": "Nintendo Famicom Disk System", "release_date": "September 19, 1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Marionette", "publishers": "Pony Canyon", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.6", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HucMTisD5wc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/50696\n"}
