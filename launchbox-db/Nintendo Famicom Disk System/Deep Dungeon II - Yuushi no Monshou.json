{"name": "Deep Dungeon II: Yuushi no Monshou", "overview": "The second game in the Deep Dungeon series, Yuushi no Monshou (lit: \"Crest of the Hero\") is a first-person 3D dungeon crawler RPG in the mold of Wizardry or Dungeon Master. The goal of the game is to reach the end of the dungeon with the hero, defeating all manner of monsters and finding treasure along the way. Graphically the game is much improved over the first one, as well as the difficulty is reduced. Another notable difference is that there are two dungeons instead of one: A four-level castle (the easier of the two) and a four-level dungeon. Defeating the tower is necessary for defeating the dungeon, largely because of how difficult the monsters become. The player can also visit the temple and shop in town. The former will replenish health and heal poison, while the latter provides various weapons and items for the hero to use.", "platform": "Nintendo Famicom Disk System", "release_date": "May 30, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Humming Bird Soft", "publishers": "Disk Original Group", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Dungeon", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMBxHNzBx0E", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/41184\n"}
