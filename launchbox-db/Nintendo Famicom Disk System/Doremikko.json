{"name": "Doremikko", "overview": "Doremikko is a music game developed by Konami for the Famicom Disk System and published in late 1987. Like a few other music games of its kind, it comes complete with a digital keyboard which connects to the Famicom for the purpose of composing and playing music.

The title of the game is often mistranslated as \"Dreamiko\", but it is intended to be a play on the names for the first three notes of a scale; Do, Re, Mi. Having been developed by Konami, the game actually features a medly of Gradius music, and contains a cameo of the Vic Viper on the menu screen. It was only release in Japan, and never translated into any other language.", "platform": "Nintendo Famicom Disk System", "release_date": "December 4, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Music", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.12", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doremikko", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/52452\n"}
