{"name": "Bishoujo Mahjong Club", "overview": "An adult mahjong game with two girls to choose from and a \"battle mode\". At odd intervals of points, you are treated to the girl of choice stripping, which equates to an unnecessarily long musical number, slow text filling in her speech bubble, and then a flash before she reappears minus one article of clothing. The girl can win back clothes if your score drops.", "platform": "Nintendo Famicom Disk System", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hacker International", "publishers": "Hacker International", "genres": "Casino", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.8", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elDje-Q70oA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40516\n"}
