{"name": "Pro Wres", "overview": "The first professional wrestling game released on the Nintendo Famicom, Pro Wres is notable for many of the innovations it made to the wrestling game genre. The game featured one of the earliest in-ring referees, notable for actually moving into position to make counts, as well as the first instance of a camera man in a wrestling game. Pro Wres was also notable for being among the first wrestling games to feature unique wrestler movesets, with each grappler featuring at least one signature manuever. Pro Wres roster includes seven wrestlers, with six playable and one boss character. Normal single player gameplay consists of playing a series of five matches before confronting the V.W.A. champion, King Slender, in a title match. However, when playing as Slender, Great Panther serves as the champion boss. Upon winning the title, the second stage of gameplay consists of defending the title ten times before facing V.W.F. champion Great Puma in an interpromotional match to crown the undisputed wrestling champion and end the game. Two player gameplay consists of one-on-one matches, each being the best of three falls. Pro Wres is notable for introducing the world to the famously mistranslated \"A WINNER IS YOU\" after each victory. The phrase has gone on to become a famous internet meme, being reference elsewhere in popular culture.", "platform": "Nintendo Famicom Disk System", "release_date": "October 21, 1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "TRY", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.79", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Wrestling_(NES_video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQaQg8gqtBM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/43324\n"}
