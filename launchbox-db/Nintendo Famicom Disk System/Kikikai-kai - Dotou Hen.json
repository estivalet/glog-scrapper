{"name": "Kikikai-kai: Dotou Hen", "overview": "A port of the arcade shooter of the same name, Kikikai-kai: Dotou Hen puts you in the shoes of Shinto priestess Sayo, as she traverses feudal Japan in hopes of rescuing the ancient spirits of luck that have been taken captive by a collection of monsters straight out of Japanese folklore. The game plays as a scrolling top-down shooter with complete freedom of movement, which allows for maze-like stages that Sayo must clear of enemies using her ceremonial baton and her mystic energies. The game features two-player \"hotseat\" gameplay in which the 2nd player takes over when the first one loses a life, longer levels than the arcade version, and modifies the gameplay mechanics somewhat by including a life bar and finite ammo.", "platform": "Nintendo Famicom Disk System", "release_date": "August 28, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bits Laboratory", "publishers": "Taito", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.67", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KiKi_KaiKai", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/50602\n"}
