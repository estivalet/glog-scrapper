{"name": "Samurai Sword", "overview": "Samurai Sword is a fantasy adventure game for the Famicom Disk System. The game begins with the hero (named by the player) being defeated in battle by the dark priest Soron. The hero must advance through different landscapes searching for the Samurai Sword, the only weapon strong enough to destroy Soron. Along the way you are accompanied by Saria, a light mage with access to various spells. The game controls like a visual novel with all actions selected from a text menu. Apart from the normal puzzle-solving gameplay, there are occasionally battles against monsters. These are also solved and won through text commands, often times requiring the help of Saria's magic. The game is divided into multiple sections, between which players can save their progress.", "platform": "Nintendo Famicom Disk System", "release_date": "November 15, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Capcom", "publishers": "Capcom", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZjknfK1af8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/43522\n"}
