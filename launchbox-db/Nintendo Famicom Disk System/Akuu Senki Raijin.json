{"name": "Akuu Senki Raijin", "overview": "Akuu Senki Raijin is a vertical shooter where the player controls a mecha that transforms into a starfighter. Like Square's earlier semi-classic Thexder, the player can opt to change between the two modes of their craft at certain points during each level. Upon touching ground as the mecha, the player is occasionally able to find other directions to continue exploring as a spaceship, presenting both vertical-scrolling and side-scrolling shoot-'em-up sections.", "platform": "Nintendo Famicom Disk System", "release_date": "July 12, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Micro Cabin", "publishers": "Disk Original Group", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.61", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/49936\n"}
