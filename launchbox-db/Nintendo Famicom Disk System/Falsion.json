{"name": "Falsion", "overview": "Falsion is an intense 3D shooter by Konami. In 21XX, humanity has colonized space. But during its quest to find more habitable planets, humans have faced an aggressive alien race who wants nothing but destruction. Their fleet has now entered our solar system and hurls towards Earth. Only the new Falsion spacecraft and its courageous pilot stand a chance to save humanity from destruction. It will be a long journey through six varied stages, from asteroid fields to narrow and deep canyons. The craft can use a simple Vulcan laser gun or secondary, and in limited supplies, homing missiles. Power-ups, in the shape of floating orbs stamped with the letter P, sometimes appear from defeated enemies. Blue ones speed-up the ship and red ones increase the depleting stock of homing missiles. The greatest feature of this unusual title is certainly the 3D option, which can be activated from the option menu or by pressing select at anytime during the game (Nintendo's official 3D glasses must be used though).", "platform": "Nintendo Famicom Disk System", "release_date": "October 21, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.23", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsion", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEVwMAJjcLk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/42511\n"}
