{"name": "Game no Tatsujin: Money Wars", "overview": "A board game that takes you and a girl across the world, investing in property and services in the hopes of reaching home first and having more money by the end. You can choose between three girls to play against, and if you win, they strip. Although all of the menus are in Japanese, it's not too terribly difficult to understand. The premise is that you buy what you can afford and hope that your investments will pay off in time; the more you own, the bigger your payoff.", "platform": "Nintendo Famicom Disk System", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Indies Soft", "publishers": "Indies Soft", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/95856\n"}
