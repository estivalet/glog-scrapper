{"name": "Ice Hockey", "overview": "Ice Hockey is a sports game for one or two players. Start of by selecting a team and customizing your players. Each team member can be one of three player types: small and skinny (very fast, but not good at checking or shooting), very large (slow, but with a strong body check and outstanding shooting strength) or average (medium speed, with average checking and shooting strength). After the teams are set up, it's time to play some ice hockey! Gameplay features a scrolling screen to follow the action, and lets you choose which of the players you wish to control when on defense (on offense you always control the player with the puck). Fights can break out between players, and the loser may end up in the penalty box. There are five different speed settings for the game, and periods can be either 7, 10, or 15 minutes long.", "platform": "Nintendo Famicom Disk System", "release_date": "January 21, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nintendo EAD", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_Hockey_(1988_video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bFCjkPmu1Y", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/43206\n"}
