{"name": "The Monitor Puzzle Kineko: Kinetic Connection II", "overview": "A Disk Writer only release, The Monitor Puzzle Kinetic Connection: Kineco II is the sequel in which new puzzles are introduced. Like it's prequel the game challenges player to piece together ten images in a jigsaw puzzle like fashion. However, every piece is exactly the same size, and the images on the pieces move. Rather than using the shape of the edges to determine what pieces fit next to one another, you must use the animation on the pieces to determine their arrangement. When each puzzle begins, the pieces are also oriented randomly, so you may be required to flip them vertically or horizontally in order to complete the puzzle. There are 10 different animations, and you can choose between dividing the images into 16, 24, or 48 distinct pieces before attempting to solve the puzzle. Obviously, the fewer pieces, the easier it is to solve.", "platform": "Nintendo Famicom Disk System", "release_date": "May 1, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tamtex", "publishers": "Irem", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/50605\n"}
