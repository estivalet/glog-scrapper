{"name": "Kamen Rider Black: Taiketsu Shadow Moon", "overview": "The game is based on the Kamen Rider Black television series, which was the eight installment of the Kamen Rider superhero series. After being kidnapped by the cult Gorgom on the night of their 19th birthday, stepbrothers Kotaro Minami and Nobuhiko Akizuki were submitted to a cyborg surgery with the purpose of becoming the candidates for the next Gorgom Creation King. Both of them are called Century Kings and are destined to best each other in a final battle - whoever wins will become the next Creation King. Kotaro escaped before getting brainwashed (which is the final step in the surgery), with help from his foster father, and turned against Gorgom. He soon finds out the horrific truth from his stepfather: Gorgom originally killed his true parents and, since both Kotaro and Nobuhiko were born on the day of a solar eclipse, referred as \"Black Sun\" and \"Shadow Moon\". Kotaro, taking on the name of Kamen Rider Black, was determined to rescue his stepbrother from Gorgom while protecting Japan. However, later in the series, Nobuhiko emerged as Shadow Moon to fight Kotaro with the survivor becoming the next Creation King. In the game, players take control of Kamen Rider Black, who must defeat numerous Gorgom mutants. There are five levels of four stages each. In the first four levels, players must complete three side scrolling stages with a boss at the end. In the fourth stage, the player must fight against a final level boss using a zoomed in perspective with larger sprites. The player gets to ride Battle Hopper motorcycle throughout the second and fourth levels. The fifth level is composed entirely of boss fights, first against three Evil Lords, and then against Shadow Moon. If the player loses against Shadow Moon, the bad ending is shown before the game ends.", "platform": "Nintendo Famicom Disk System", "release_date": "April 15, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Human Entertainment", "publishers": "Bandai", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.56", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz3abFoMP5o", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/43249\n"}
