{"name": "Exciting Soccer: Konami Cup", "overview": "In Exciting Soccer: Konami Cup you must choose from one of six pre-made teams and lead them through the Konami Cup, by playing against the other teams twice, making for a total of ten matches. Each team has different qualities and strengths in five different values. They are \"Kick\", \"Running\", \"Dribble\", \"Defence\" and \"Luck\". After each match you can spend extra points to raise one or more values. If you make it to the top of the league table at the end of the season you win the game. Besides the \"Cup Mode\" you can choose to play a game against another human player. The playing field is seen from an overhead view and the gameplay is arcade-style and action-oriented, leaving out many soccer rules like fouls and offside.", "platform": "Nintendo Famicom Disk System", "release_date": "February 16, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI6UIxBT6zo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/41603\n"}
