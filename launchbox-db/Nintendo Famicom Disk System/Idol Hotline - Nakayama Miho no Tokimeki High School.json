{"name": "Idol Hotline: Nakayama Miho no Tokimeki High School", "overview": "The game's protagonist enters Tokimeki High School and runs into a girl wearing glasses who looks identical to Miho Nakayama. Though the game is a standard text command-style adventure game similar to the Famicom Tantei Club series, in important scenes, the player is required to select a facial expression in addition to a verbal response. The four expressions (straight face, laughter, sadness, anger) must match the content of the response being given, and any incorrect responses immediately lead to the \"game over\" screen. This increased the game's difficulty considerably in comparison to other text adventure games where there were fewer incorrect choices. Some scenes specifically require that the dialogue not match with the expression. For instance, choosing a dialogue expressing joy with a straight face may be the correct choice in a certain situation because it represents a deeper level of emotion and thought on the part of the protagonist. This system allowed the game to simulate a level of complexity resembling actual love relationships, leading to its classification as a dating simulation rather than an adventure game. The game has two different endings, depending on the choices made during the game, and the prizes receivable via the Disk Fax network differed for each ending.", "platform": "Nintendo Famicom Disk System", "release_date": "December 1, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Square", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakayama_Miho_no_Tokimeki_High_School", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bv4d6MHDcio", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/43302\n"}
