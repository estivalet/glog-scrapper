{"name": "Putt Putt Golf", "overview": "Putt Putt Golf by Pack-In-Video is one of many golf games for the Famicom and the Famicom Disk System, but one of the few to take players through an abstract world rather than an approximation of a real golf course. The goal of each stage is to reach the hole on the green and pot the ball in as few strokes as possible, but each of the courses are covered with various obstacles - some animated, some stationary. The player must navigate around them (or use them to their advantage, in some cases) in order to achieve the best score.", "platform": "Nintendo Famicom Disk System", "release_date": "March 30, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Pack-In Video", "publishers": "Pack-In-Video", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/53520\n"}
