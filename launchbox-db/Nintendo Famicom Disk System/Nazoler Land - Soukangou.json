{"name": "Nazoler Land: Soukangou", "overview": "Nazoler Land Soukan Gou is the first in a series of minigame collections from SunSoft developed especially for Nintendo's Famicom Disk System peripheral. It was followed by two direct sequels and a quiz-based spin-off. Nazoler Land Soukan Gou (or Nazoler Land Vol. 1) has eight minigames that the player can select from a menu after loading the game up and switching the disk around. These are: Kaiten Meiro Doorman - Players have to traverse several floors of a maze. However, freely moving around the maze is made difficult because of gates that can only swing open certain ways. Nazoler Uranai - A Mastermind variant featuring signs of the zodiac. Figuring out the correct answer will reward the player with a fortune telling message. Super Jigsaw - As the name suggests, a jigsaw puzzle game. Players can only switch one tile with another one at a time. Momoko-hime o Sukue! - A first-person adventure game. Players explore a dungeon labyrinth on a mission to rescue Princess Momoko. Nihon Issh\u016b Ultra Quiz Ryok\u014d - A quiz game. If the player answers a question right they will be awarded money which they can then use to travel to different sites in Japan. Famicom Tekiseikensa - Players take the role of a cowboy in a duel against another cowboy. Whoever can press the fire button the most times in ten seconds wins the duel. This game is for one or two players. Oshidashi Puzzle - Players have to shoot various rows and columns of tiles into their correct position.
