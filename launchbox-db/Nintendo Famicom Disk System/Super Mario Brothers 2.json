{"name": "Super Mario Brothers 2", "overview": "The Princess has been kidnapped by King Koopa (again) and it's up to Mario and Luigi to save her (again). Not to be confused with the western Super Mario Bros. 2, this sequel to Super Mario Bros. is very much an expansion to the original, with many reused graphics and concepts, though new ones are also present. Instead of offering a two-player mode as in the original, this game allows you to choose between a Mario mode and a Luigi mode, with each character handling differently. Mario has tighter ground control, while Luigi has greater jumping capabilities. Power-ups remain the same: Super Mushrooms grow a brother from small to Super size, Fire Flowers give them the ability to throw fireballs at enemies, Starman makes a character temporarily invincible, and a 1-Up Mushroom will give one more life. New to this game is a power-down, a Poison Mushroom which will harm you as if it were an enemy.", "platform": "Nintendo Famicom Disk System", "release_date": "June 3, 1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nintendo R&D4", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.93", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros.:_The_Lost_Levels", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdq73rb2rvE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40377\n"}
