{"name": "Mahjong Kazoku", "overview": "Mahjong Kazoku (\"Mahjong Family\") is a standard Mahjong simulation game for Nintendo's Famicom Disk System. It is a one-on-one version of the game, rather than the standard four-player board game arrangement, and it incorporates many of the various and byzantine scoring rules of the game. Irem developed and published the game but left a mysterious licensing credit to Ox Inc. on the title screen. It's possible the game is a port of an obscure Japanese Mahjong computer game, or at least borrows some of its coding for the AI opponent or scoring systems.", "platform": "Nintendo Famicom Disk System", "release_date": "August 4, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Irem", "publishers": "Irem", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFs7Fun0iVA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/43294\n"}
