{"name": "Super Lode Runner II", "overview": "Irem created four Arcade versions of the original Lode Runner, each with a unique set of levels as well as added features like a co-operative mode for two players. For the FDS home versions, Irem compiled several levels from each of these Arcade versions onto one disk. Super Lode Runner II has fewer single-player levels than its predecessor, but contains more co-op levels to make up for it. The gameplay is largely identical to that of the original Lode Runner: Players must collect all the gold on a stage and leave via a ladder. They must also avoid the enemies around the stage, which tend to home in on the player. In order to defend themselves, the player character can dig holes at their feet which can trap enemies and will also allow the protagonist to reach buried gold. Each level tends to have a specific strategy to it that the player must puzzle out if they intend to progress.", "platform": "Nintendo Famicom Disk System", "release_date": "August 25, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tamtex", "publishers": "Irem", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lode_Runner", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1z621gEBdo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/18759\n"}
