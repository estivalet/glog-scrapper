{"name": "Kattobi! Douji", "overview": "Kattobi! Douji is a Japanese baseball game that plays far more like a strategic sim where the player controls the whole team rather than an action game in which the player is only directly responsible for whomever is pitching and batting. The game is based on an obscure manga of the same name about a competitive high school baseball team. Rather than controlling the batter or the pitcher, the player selects one of several \"plays\", which resemble cards with various symbols in different spots, and the opponent does likewise. The next pitch then plays out depending on how the two plays corresponded with one another.", "platform": "Nintendo Famicom Disk System", "release_date": "October 20, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Pack-In Video", "publishers": "Pack-In-Video", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0EhAyurUA0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/50066\n"}
