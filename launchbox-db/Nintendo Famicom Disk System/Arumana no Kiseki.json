{"name": "Arumana no Kiseki", "overview": "The Arumana, a legendary red jewel, has been stolen, and the villagers have all turned to stone. Now it's up to Kaito to retrieve the jewel and restore it to its rightful owners. The action takes place from a side-scrolling perspective. The protagonist must advance through six stages using his wits, his weapons, and his trusty grappling hook. The grappling hook is extremely indispensable as it is used to climb upwards to out-of-reach ledges. This skill is used frequently as it is required to advance through the often vertically oriented stages. Kaito begins with nothing more than a set of throwing knives, but along the way he can find bombs, pistols, bolas, screen clearing crystals, and mines. With some diligent searching, he can even find health extending necklaces and 1ups in the form of fedoras.", "platform": "Nintendo Famicom Disk System", "release_date": "August 11, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.15", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arumana_no_Kiseki", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbe_VCYrWJY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40328\n"}
