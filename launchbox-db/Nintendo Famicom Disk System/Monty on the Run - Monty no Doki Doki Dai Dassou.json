{"name": "Monty on the Run: Monty no Doki Doki Dai Dassou", "overview": "In 1987, Jaleco procured the rights to publish Monty on the Run in Japan on the Famicom Disk System. Rather than stay close to the source material, like they did with their port of Knight Lore, Monty on the Run was drastically changed for this release. Renamed Monty no Doki Doki Daisassou, or \"Monty's Heart-Pounding Great Escape\", the game plays much more like a straightforward NES platformer. The goal is to search caverns to find tiles with parts of the true culprit's face - forming the full image at the end will get Monty off the hook. It still retains some aspects of the original, such as a version of Hubbard's famous theme and obtaining necessary escape items. Monty (though now a human) still flips while jumping like the original Monty did.", "platform": "Nintendo Famicom Disk System", "release_date": "July 31, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jaleco", "publishers": "Jaleco", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_on_the_Run", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuVlZgU1scg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/43300\n"}
