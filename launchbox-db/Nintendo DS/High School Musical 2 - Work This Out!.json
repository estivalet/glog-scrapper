{"altername_name": [], "name": "High School Musical 2: Work This Out!", "overview": "You play as Troy, Gabriella, Ryan, Sharpay, Chad and Taylor, helping them perform a series of different daily tasks during their working holiday at the Laval Springs Resort. Your goal is to ultimately win the Star Dazzle talent show. The game mostly consists of rhythm-based mini-games such as picking up golf balls, making sandwiches, watch over sunbathers (you tap on their umbrellas to open them up), grab basketballs and dance by tapping circles, all to the beat of the music. You also collect hidden items in the Lava Springs Resort and rehearse dance routines. You can also unlock songs from the movie, playable using the included jukebox that you can listen to while the DS is closed.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "April 15, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Artificial Mind & Movement", "publishers": "Disney Interactive Studios", "genres": "Music", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/79657-high-school-musical-2-work-this-out\n"}
