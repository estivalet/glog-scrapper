The game is set in the same universe as the original, a Japanese university, where the player character assumes the role of a student investigating the mysterious absence of one of his classmates. The same urban legend still circulates about a cursed nameless JRPG game for the TS (a fictional in-game world analogy for the Nintendo DS), which, much like in the previous game, can be transmitted from one portable console to the other. While investigating his classmate's absence, the player discovers a horrible truth about him, and receives a special gift from a mysterious entity: the ability to use his left eye to see things normal humans can't.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "August 27, 2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Epics", "publishers": "Square Enix", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.6", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanashi_no_Game#Sequels_and_spin-offs", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/31176-nanashi-no-game-me\n"}
