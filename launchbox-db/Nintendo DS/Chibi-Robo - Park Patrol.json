Chibi-Robo!", "\u5f00\u82b1\u5427!\u5c0f\u673a\u5668\u4eba"], "name": "Chibi-Robo: Park Patrol", "overview": "There's more happiness to spread, and Chibi-Robo is just the robot to do it! A pollution epidemic is transforming the local park into a contaminated wasteland. It's up to Chibi-Robo to return the park to its former glory and defeat Sergeant Smogglor, champion of all things toxic and gross. With his trusty squirter and boom box in hand, Chibi must raise flowers, defeat noxious Smoglings and save the world. \u2022 Touch controls let players interact with the world in new ways. Slide the stylus with good timing to squirt enemies, water flowers, pedal a bike and blast a boom box. \u2022 Chibi's mission is bigger than ever this time around. Instead of living in a single home with one family, Chibi's on his own in the park now, spreading happiness to an entire town. The screen might be smaller, but the world is much bigger. \u2022 As Chibi progresses in this green adventure, he'll meet all sorts of colorful characters, like marionette Francois, football mascot Bull and soda \"spokesanimals\" Pop and Fizz. If Chibi befriends these toys, they will help him in his quest to fix the park. One of the focuses of this game is developing relationships with other toys, who, once befriended, give players Happy Points and help them with their park projects.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "October 2, 2007", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Skip", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.11", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chibi-Robo!:_Park_Patrol", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6413-chibi-robo-park-patrol\n"}
