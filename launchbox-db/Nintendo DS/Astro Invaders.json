With small quantities of \"Star Platinum,\" a mineral found in the asteroid belts, the tachyon-reactor could produce an immense amount of clean energy. This maintained interplanetary travel and the gigantic oxygen-generators required by the colonies. Human colonies appeared on all the 9 planets of the solar system. In the Year 3187, a vast pirate fleet appeared out of hyperspace and caught us off guard. In a short time our defences were destroyed, leaving the area under pirate control. After numerous defeats it was decided to stop harvesting the \"Star Platinum.\" The pirate leader sent a final ultimatum right before destroying the last of our battle ships: \"The only way for the federation to survive is to surrender.\" 18 unique enemies and bosses 8 different levels each with 4 sub-levels Easy, normal and hard modes PLUS insane mode unlocked by completing the game in hard mode!", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "July 6, 2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "7 Raven Studios", "publishers": "Zoo Publishing", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78256-astro-invaders\n"}
