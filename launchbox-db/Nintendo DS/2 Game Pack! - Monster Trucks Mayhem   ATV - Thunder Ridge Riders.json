Put your skills to the test against others in a free-wheeling carnage of destruction and mayhem. Players race using ATVs (All-Terrain Vehicles) in different game modes such as Quick Game, Career Mode or Timed Checkpoint, pick up money icons to upgrade the vehicle in the Mod Shop with new tires, engines, shocks or turbo boosts. In Monster Truck Mayhem the screens are divided just like ATV: Thunder Ridge Riders with similar controls. There are different trucks to compete at two types of events: Track Races (regular racing) and Crunch Melee (crunch more cars than the competition).", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "August 15, 2007", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Destination Software", "publishers": "Destination Software", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/340418-2-game-pack-monster-trucks-mayhem-atv-thunder-ridge-riders\n"}
