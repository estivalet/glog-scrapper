{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cut the Rope", "overview": "The premise of Cut the Rope is simple: a cute alien called Om Nom is hungry for candy, and it\u2019s your job to make sure that he gets it. What follows is a physics-based puzzle game where you cut ropes to swing and manoeuvre the candy into Om Nom\u2019s mouth. Holding the DSi on its side \u2014 in a 'book' style \u2014 you cut ropes with a simple swipe of the stylus, while there are also air balloons to tap, bubbles that enable the candy to float and moveable anchors to manipulate the angle and tension of the line. As you would expect of a puzzle game designed solely for touchscreens, it all feels intuitive and easy to play.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "2011", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Abstraction Games", "publishers": "Chilingo", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/134851-cut-the-rope\n"}
