{"altername_name": ["Double Pack: Cradle of Rome + Cradle of Egypt"], "name": "Double Pack: Cradle of Rome / Cradle of Egypt", "overview": "Jewel Master: Cradle Of Rome Welcome to the birth of the Roman Empire where players re-create the legendary city of old using a unique variation of the much-loved Jewel Master puzzle mechanic. Players still swap two adjacent squares around to create a row of three or more, but instead of completing the board as quickly as possible, the goal is to gather as many resources as you can before the timer runs out. The more resources you gather, the faster you can build Rome. Start with a lowly saw mill and progress to gain access to historical monuments such as the Arch of Titus, the Temples of Venus and Saturn and eventually the mighty Coliseum. Jewel Master: Cradle Of Egypt Welcome to the land of the pyramids and temples - the cradle of civilization! Take yourself on a journey back in time to the origins of the ancient Egyptians and witness the development of one of the most fascinating cultures in the history of man! The follow-up to Cradle Of Rome, one of the best-selling casual games of 2009, Cradle Of Egypt perfectly combines addictive puzzle gameplay with an engaging resource management mechanic. Completing each game board provides access to new resources required to construct the civilization of Egypt.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "2011", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Rising Star Games", "publishers": "", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/129894-double-pack-cradle-of-rome-cradle-of-egypt\n"}
