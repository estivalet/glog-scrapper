{"altername_name": ["Pokemon Sacred Gold"], "name": "Pok\u00e9mon Sacred Gold", "overview": "Sacred Gold and Storm Silver are the fourth set of hacks/edits I've done now; others you might be familiar with are Pok\u00e9mon Fire Red Omega, Pok\u00e9mon Spirit Gold, and for those of you native to GBAtemp, Pok\u00e9mon Blaze Black and Volt White. Given that it's one of my hacks, it has a pretty similar style in the sense that all Pok\u00e9mon are available, there's an increased difficulty curve, there are (optional) changes to Pok\u00e9mon to make some of them better etcetera. You may wonder why I've chosen to make another HG/SS hack when I've done Spirit Gold previously; the answer to this question is that Spirit Gold never really took full advantage of the tools available for DS games, particularly in terms of scripting. Compared to Spirit Gold, Sacred Gold and Storm Silver are full of new scripted events and other aesthetic changes to make it both full of content and a pleasure to look at.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "May 25, 2012", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Drayano", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/146620-pokemon-sacred-gold\n"}
