Players\u2019 progression is determined through their use of the cards to evolve characters, strengthen moves and create new moves. In the game, cards are marked with eight types of actions, eight power levels and eight guard levels for a total of 512 possible combinations that will determine progress. Players are dealt five randomly selected cards to play with each card denoting one of eight types of actions. The intensity of special attacks will increase as the game progresses and multiple cards can be played together to power up attacks and enhance guard levels for super combos. While the game will progress even if players do not choose the best cards, strategic players will be able to unlock more surprises and become true masters. DBZ: Goku Densetsu also supports wireless battle for up to 4 players and includes a game sharing mode.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "August 31, 2007", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "BEC", "publishers": "Atari", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.24", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Ball_Z:_Harukanaru_Densetsu", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVqiW67wW6g", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27795-dragon-ball-z-harukanaru-densetsu\n"}
