Do you know your walking routine? and in Japan as Aruite Wakaru Seikatsu Rhythm DS is an exergaming application developed by Nintendo Network Service Development (Nintendo NSD) and Creatures Inc. for the Nintendo DS. The pedometer accessory was developed in-house at Nintendo NSD, while the software portion was developed in conjunction with Nintendo NSD, Creatures Inc., and Engines. Personal Trainer: Walking allows up to four users to track their walking, jogging or running activities through a series of graphs, charts and statistics, as well as set goals for themselves. The game is packaged with two infrared pedometers that communicate to the game the user's walking data. Additional pedometers will be sold separately. The game uses Miis to track each user's progress, and allows users to either create a Mii in-game (A first for the Nintendo DS), or wirelessly transfer an existing Mii from a Wii console's Mii Channel to their Nintendo DS. The game also features a number of minigames to unlock.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "May 26, 2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Creatures", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.12", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_Trainer:_Walking", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/100135-personal-trainer-walking\n"}
