{"altername_name": ["Treasure Master"], "name": "Treasure Masters, Inc.", "overview": "Treasure Masters Inc. is an adventure / puzzle game that is played entirely with the touch screen. The scenario leads us to search for an ancient artifact, of which Gordon Jones and his grandfather do not know the exact position. It will therefore be necessary to conduct the survey around the world, while monitoring other treasure hunters.

The title embeds some mini-games of reflection, just to change the situations a little.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "December 13, 2011", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "MSL", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/104054-treasure-masters-inc\n"}
