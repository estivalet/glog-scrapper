{"altername_name": [], "name": "Front Mission 2089: Border of Madness", "overview": "Front Mission 2089 was a new frontier for the series, mainly as it was the first game made for the mobile phone. It was released in 2005 with periodic episode downloads, which were released on a monthly basis. The story of Front Mission 2089-I takes place in 2089, one year before the 2nd Huffman Conflict. Players can choose to fight for the OCU or the USN, but story and character development remain the same in both cases. The only thing that changes with that option is the main character artwork. Front Mission 2089: Border of Madness for the Nintendo DS covers the entire 2089-I story. Rather than let the player choose which side to fight for, Border of Madness uses the OCU cast of characters from Front Mission 2089-I. While 2089-II was not fully included, parts of it are there as a means to tie the two games together. New plot elements were added to help tie the 2089 mini-series into the main series, along with recurring characters from the other games.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "May 29, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "h.a.n.d.", "publishers": "Square Enix", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.43", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_Mission_2089", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQFyStACkno", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/57333-front-mission-2089-border-of-madness\n"}
