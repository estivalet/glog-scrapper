And if that's not enough of a dilemma, you've woken up one day to discover that you've mysteriously transformed into a Pok\u00e9mon yourself! After teaming up with another Pok\u00e9mon, the pair of you decide to form a rescue team, and save other Pok\u00e9mon who are in trouble and need help. Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team is a Pok\u00e9mon-themed version of a game series called Fushigi no Dungeon, or Mystery Dungeon in English. The basic concept for each of these games is that you must travel through a series of randomly generated dungeons, battling enemies and collecting items as you make your way deeper until you reach a specified floor in the dungeon. Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon applies various aspects of the Pok\u00e9mon Universe to the Mystery Dungeon series. You can level up your characters, have other Pok\u00e9mon (up to a maximum of six characters in your party) join you, level up, evolve, and learn new attacks and abilities. You do not directly control other members of your team; they are AI controlled, but you can issue them specific commands such as \"follow me\", \"avoid first attack\", and \"attack enemies\". Another goal of the game is collecting all of the different types of Pok\u00e9mon by recruiting them as members of your rescue team. Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon can also communicate with other copies of Blue Rescue Team and Red Rescue Team. You can choose to rescue a friend who has become stranded while performing a rescue mission of their own, or you can trade items with them instead.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "September 18, 2006", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Chunsoft", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.92", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Mystery_Dungeon:_Blue_Rescue_Team_and_Red_Rescue_Team", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/8Dh1E_DiZRU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2251-pokemon-mystery-dungeon-blue-rescue-team\n"}
