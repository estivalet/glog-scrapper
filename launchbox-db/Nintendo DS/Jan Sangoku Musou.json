{"altername_name": [], "name": "Jan Sangoku Musou", "overview": "Jan Sangoku Musou (\u96c0\u30fb\u4e09\u570b\u7121\u53cc) is a Mahjong game using Dynasty Warriors characters. There are no battlefields involved but there is interaction between warring generals with dialog that somewhat parodies Dynasty Warriors 5. This title is only available in Japan. Koei has no current intentions to release this in North America or Europe. Players name their own \"Mahjong warrior\" from 32 preset designs and 6 different voice sets. Once the player has decided on a character, they can choose to either participate in a tournament or in one of the game's story modes. Each match in story mode has four participants, the player being set against three characters from the Dynasty Warriors series. The rules are similar to other Mahjong games but includes cuts of the series's characters during matches. Image displays are often voiced and essentially give hints regarding the opposition's situation. These cuts sometimes include the characters posing with their weapons or displaying emotions rarely seen in the series, which makes these instances unintentionally hilarious. The rules and scores are very similar to a form of Japanese mahjong, particularly the type that is found in competitive mahjong games and yaku. Players can still forfeit their hand and use pon, chii, riichi, or kan. Though the player is allowed to change certain rules, there are rules that remain by default.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "September 28, 2006", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Koei", "publishers": "Koei", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/141244-jan-sangoku-musou\n"}
