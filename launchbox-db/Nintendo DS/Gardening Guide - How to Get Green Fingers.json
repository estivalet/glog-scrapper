The game guides you towards plants from its 400-strong encyclopaedia that suit your soil, garden aspect and your preferred planting style; then you can add the ones you want to your virtual plot. The guide dispenses timely tips and useful information for the plants you've chosen, and you can also test your knowledge with quizzes and add your own reminders to the calendar.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/102202-gardening-guide-how-to-get-green-fingers\n"}
