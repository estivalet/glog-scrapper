Trauma Center: Under the Knife lets YOU play doctor, performing increasingly complex surgeries. At first it's just another day in the O.R., but when a mysterious outbreak sweeps the area, the patients' lives are in your hands--no pressure. The stylus will be your scalpel as you make incisions, anesthetize problem areas, remove tumors, monitor vital signs, apply bandages, and more! Of course, you'll also have to deal with human drama between appointments. Keep a cool head, or you'll be out on the street (and all those years of medical school for nothing).", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "June 16, 2005", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Atlus", "publishers": "Atlus", "genres": "Life Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.43", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_Center:_Under_the_Knife", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtRz8U0iaNY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6604-trauma-center-under-the-knife\n"}
