{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Tower DS", "overview": "The Tower DS is a building management simulation developed and published by DigiToys for the Nintendo DS platform. It's part of the Sim Tower series, in the same way as The Tower SP. Build and maintain a tower. Different scenarios are available to play, which can be thought of as different challenges. The gameplay makes use of both screens and there's an added tutorial mode. Otherwise it's largely the same as the SP version right down to the graphics. It supports the button control scheme that was present in the SP version. It does not add full stylus and touch screen control.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "June 26, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/140983-the-tower-ds\n"}
