{"altername_name": ["\u4e50\u9ad8\u5927\u6218"], "name": "LEGO Battles", "overview": "LEGO Battles is a real-time strategy game based on the popular building brick toy line, incorporating three LEGO themes: Castle, Pirates and Space. The game's main story mode consists of six campaigns (two per theme world), depicting both sides of each conflict: King and Wizard (featuring Undead, Dwarves and Trolls), Pirates and Imperials (featuring Islanders and Ninjas) and Humans and Aliens (featuring Space Police and criminals). Humorous cutscenes in the style of other TT Games LEGO titles illustrate the storyline. Only the King campaign is accessible from the start, the others have to be unlocked. A campaign consists of three acts of four to six missions each. The game is mainly controlled via the lower screen of the DS. Here the game map is displayed in detail, and commands are given via a stylus-based point-and-touch interface. The upper screen normally displays an overview of the game map or details of selected units.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "June 9, 2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Hellbent Games", "publishers": "Warner Bros.
