{"altername_name": ["\u718a\u59ec\u548c\u5979\u7684\u4f19\u4f34\u4eec"], "name": "Kumatanchi", "overview": "Kumatanchi is a life simulation video game, set in a zoo housing moe anthropomorphic young girls; the player assumes the role of a caretaker at a zoo, tasked with looking after a new arrival, the bear girl Kuma-tan. The interactions with Kuma-tan influence her mood and performance during public shows in the zoo. The game takes place over two weeks in real-time, during which time the player must raise Kuma-tan's standing in the zoo by interacting with her as much as possible. The player interacts with her in her home, which can be outfitted with furniture and activities. At set points in the game, Kuma-tan receives visits from other zoo inhabitants, which further reflect on Kuma-Tan's progress. Kuma-tan's mood and hunger levels are each divided into five stages, and can be maintained by feeding and interacting with her regularly. While players can give positive reinforcement to her by patting her head. Too much patting can cause her to misbehave, and may be balanced with a disciplinary flick to the forehead. Players may interact with other animals in the zoo, allowing Kuma-tan's mood to become better by taking part in conversations and activities, as well as purchase food from the zoo's shop. Accessories are paid for with money earned by selling themed merchandise and pictures of Kuma-tan to zoo visitors, with some pictures yielding higher rewards depending on Kuma-tan's mood. At the end of the two weeks, the player's choices are reflected in Kuma-tan's behavior.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "September 25, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dimple Entertainment", "publishers": "Dimple", "genres": "Life Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.25", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumatanchi", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/141589-kumatanchi\n"}
