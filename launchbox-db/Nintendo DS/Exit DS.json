To do so, the player must move Mr. Esc and the Escapees, either with the stylus or the control pad, and have them perform various actions throughout the puzzle-like levels, such as moving boxes, extinguishing flames and breaking icicles. Each different character possess a different set of abilities and problems. For example, Large People can push heavier objects, but need the help of two Adults to climb higher than 1 meter. Each level has a timer that indicates the time limit for the current stage. Depending on how fast the level was completed, the player gets a score up to 100%.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "November 4, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Moss", "publishers": "Square Enix", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/77135-exit-ds\n"}
