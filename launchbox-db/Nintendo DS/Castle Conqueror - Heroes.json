When, fearing the outbreak of war, the government of The Green Planet surrendered to \u201cThe Empire\u201d, The Empire sent a commander called Vilost to the planet. The new rulers then imposed heavy taxes and assumed military control, leaving the people to suffer extreme hardship under the strict regime. A revolt finally broke out, and a rebel leader emerged in the south of the planet; with this leader, the revolt grew in strength and number against The Empire. The leader is a woman called Veronica, and she is attempting to release the citizens imprisoned by the regime who are eager to join her rebel army. You were once a great soldier, and in joining the revolt, your objective (as well as that of your new forces) is to drive The Empire from your planet!", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "November 10, 2011", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "Circle Entertainment", "publishers": "CIRCLE Entertainment", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "0.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/159633-castle-conqueror-heroes\n"}
