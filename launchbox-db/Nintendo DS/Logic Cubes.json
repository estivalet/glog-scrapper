{"altername_name": [], "name": "Logic Cubes", "overview": "Players start with a solid block of cubes marked with numbers on the end of each row. If the number five is marked on the end of a row of six blocks, for example, one of those blocks must be eliminated. But which one? Players must deduce the answer based on the numbers marked on other rows. Players tap a chisel to eliminate blocks they think don\u2019t belong or use a paintbrush to mark ones they think should stay. Once all the appropriate blocks have been chipped away, a fun object will be revealed. There are more than 350 objects to discover in the game.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "July 15, 2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Morgen Studios", "publishers": "Kiddinx Entertainment", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/101505-logic-cubes\n"}
