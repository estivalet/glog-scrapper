{"altername_name": [], "name": "Crazy Circus", "overview": "You have inherited the Crazy Circus from your father, who has become too old and sick to go on managing it. Many years back the circus was famous all around the world, but now there are only 4 charmingly whacky events left that attract only small crowds. Your task is to perform so well and stunningly that the circus starts attracting ever-bigger crowds and new performers as its fame grows. The ultimate goal is to restore the circus to its former glory and to get to perform in the legendary Las Vegas - the climax of your world tour. So there you are, jumping fearlessly over countless cars as Oleg the Motobear, wildly throwing cakes at your fellow clowns, or swinging as a parrot from one trapeze to the next in dizzying heights while the spectators cheer their lungs out.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/79592-crazy-circus\n"}
