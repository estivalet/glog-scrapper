All the puzzles are fairly small and take up anywhere from one screen to four screens (2x2) in size. All the Mini-Marios that are collected in each room are then used in the Donkey Kong boss battle at the end of the world. All of the control is done with the stylus; no buttons are used at all.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "September 25, 2006", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Nintendo", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.59", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_vs._Donkey_Kong_2:_March_of_the_Minis", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMRMIby-64U", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6546-mario-vs-donkey-kong-2-march-of-the-minis\n"}
