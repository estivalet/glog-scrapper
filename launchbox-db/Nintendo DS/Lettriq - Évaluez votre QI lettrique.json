{"altername_name": ["Lettriq", "Lettriq: Evaluez Votre QI Lettrique"], "name": "Lettriq: \u00c9valuez votre QI lettrique", "overview": "The principle is simple. It is a question of composing words, of four letters at least, from those which are in your grid. So far all is well, we know how to do it, no problem. ;-) Where it gets tough is that the letters are distributed to you at random and the faster you compose your words, the faster they will arrive. If the letter grid is full, like in Tetris, it's lost. And believe me when you miss, for example, an \"E.\" to finish your word it is anguish! Fortunately the game's dictionary accepts conjugate forms and contains around 450,000 words (including conjugations). If you make a spelling mistake the letters automatically return to the grid. To help you in your difficult task, you can earn jokers, during challenges, which can replace any letter. These challenges take place every two minutes and if you answer them quickly enough you can earn two jokers. Be careful, they are not simple either. There are five kinds. For example, you may be asked to write a word, four or five letters long, but backwards.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "September 29, 2007", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Vocabelum", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/142258-lettriq-evaluez-votre-qi-lettrique\n"}
