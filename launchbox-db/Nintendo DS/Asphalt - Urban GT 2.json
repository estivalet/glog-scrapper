{"altername_name": [], "name": "Asphalt: Urban GT 2", "overview": "The gameplay of Urban GT 2 is often compared to Burnout, Need for Speed and other titles because players can eliminate opponents by bumping them, as well as avoiding the police. There is a wanted meter which determines the awareness level of the police, much like the wanted level system in Grand Theft Auto - if the red \"WANTED\" light flashes, it usually means that the players must do what it takes to avoid the police - otherwise they might be forced to pull over and lose their money. The game features a special appearance from The Pussycat Dolls, and a sample of Moby's single \"Lift Me Up\".", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "November 30, 2006", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Virtuous", "publishers": "Gameloft", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.26", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asphalt:_Urban_GT_2", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhpcX_aP6CM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/10781-asphalt-urban-gt-2\n"}
