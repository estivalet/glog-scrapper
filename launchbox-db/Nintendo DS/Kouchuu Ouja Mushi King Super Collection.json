{"altername_name": [], "name": "Kouchuu Ouja Mushi King Super Collection", "overview": "A long time ago, there was a forest full of trees inhabited by insects and fairies. A fairy named Popo was a friend of the insects of the forest. He refers to the Japanese beetle as \"Mushiking\". One day, giant beetles from parts unknown arrived in the forest to wreak havoc, under the control of Adder, a wizard exiled from the forest who wishes to conquer it. Popo enlists the player's help to fight against Adder. Mushiking is a rock-paper-scissors-style battle game that can be played by one player against CPU-controlled beetles, or with two or more players against each other in Tournament mode or Tag Battle mode. The game is played with cards representing beetles and skill cards related to three move types-- \"Hitting\", \"Pinching\" and \"Throwing\". Players scan their cards with the card scanner in the middle of the machine, and choose one of the three move types to execute within a given time limit. The first player whose beetle reaches 0 stamina points loses. K\u014dch\u016b \u014cja Mushiking: Super Collection is the final home installment of the Mushiking series. It came with a card reader accessory, which allowed players to scan the cards used in the arcade titles into their game.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "July 19, 2007", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/141836-kouchuu-ouja-mushi-king-super-collection\n"}
