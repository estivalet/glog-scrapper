{"altername_name": [], "name": "Football Director DS", "overview": "Designed by veteran football management game designer Roger Womack (whose credits include Championship Manager, FA Premier League Manager and Football World Manager) and developed by Bradford-based Four Door Lemon, Football Director DS brings all of the tactical and strategic depth that's expected of a contemporary football management game to Nintendo's handheld console. Taking complete control of his or her favourite team, the Football Director player grows and moulds a squad by judicious dealings in the transfer market; drawing from the game's database of around 3,800 players drawn from all of the major leagues across the globe. This squad can then be developed into a winning unit using the game's exhaustive training and tactics functions.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "November 28, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Four Door Lemon", "publishers": "Sports Director", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVz8I-j_gUk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/30570-football-director-ds\n"}
