If the settlers are satisfied with everything they need, they will go up to the next stage. As they move through each stage, they will demand more things. In continuous play mode the player can choose up to three rivals, which will advance about the same rate as the player. As the settlers advance through each stage of settlement, the player can build warships and send to possessed island and build beachheads and then attack military buildings.
