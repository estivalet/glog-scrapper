{"altername_name": ["Utsusu Made in Wario"], "name": "WarioWare: Snapped!", "overview": "Wario's just opened his very own theme park, with four amazing rollercoasters! Each one of them are manned by different characters from the WarioWare franchise, with the intent of making Wario loads of cash. So roll up, and get ready for a ride like you've never had before! WarioWare: Snapped! is the first WarioWare game created specifically for use with a camera. The game uses the Nintendo DSi's camera to control all of the microgames within each rollercoaster. At the start of the rollercoaster, you are prompted to pose for the camera, so that it can use it to track your movement and control the microgames. At the end of the rollercoaster, your results are shown, along with goofy photos of you performing the moves needed for the microgames. All of the rollercoasters require a single player, excluding Kat and Ana's, which needs to be played with two people simultaneously.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "April 3, 2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Intelligent Systems", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WarioWare:_Snapped!", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78155-warioware-snapped\n"}
