However, as the numbers resemble those from an LCD display, players can flip around numbers (for example, a 2 can be reversed to become a 5) to complete their objective. The options featured include a sprint game involving 2 to 10 different digits, a puzzle mode and an endless mode. There is even a multiplayer option where two players can go head to head with the other player acquiring Base 10 through DS Download on any Nintendo DS console.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "December 24, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Skip", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/85216-art-style-series-base-10\n"}
