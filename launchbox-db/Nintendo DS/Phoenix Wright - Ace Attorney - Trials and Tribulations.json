Phoenix faces the toughest prosecutor yet as the mysterious hard-boiled \"Godot\" tries to take him down at any cost. Players must collect evidence, survey crime scenes, weed through inconsistent testimonies, and overcome corrupt agendas to ensure that justice prevails. With the return of the popular \"psyche-lock\" interrogation tool from the previous title, \"Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Justice for All,\" players have to overcome even more intense courtroom standoffs in order to close the case. Maya Fey is a bright young girl that aids Phoenix in his trials; she harnesses her psychic powers which are useful in a pinch. Godot - the mysterious, hard-boiled prosecutor makes his appearance. Play as two lawyers - relive Mia's rookie days from the past and Phoenix's current cases in the present.
