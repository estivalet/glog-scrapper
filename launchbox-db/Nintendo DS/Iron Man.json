{"altername_name": ["Iron Man: The Official Videogame"], "name": "Iron Man", "overview": "Mostly based on the 2008 movie Iron Man, this videogame of the one-man-army hero has been released for seven different platforms. The Nintendo DS version, by A2M, is the most different one. The game of Iron Man puts you under the skin of Tony Stark. He is a billionaire weapon-industrialist and genius inventor who, after being kidnapped by terrorists who want to force him to build weapons for them, builds an armor instead to escape. Since then, he decided to stop producing weapons and keeps on working on the suit to fight them back. The games take the story further, giving the player the chance to go through 8 different missions, divided in by air and by foot missions, and even fight villains that do not appear on the movie, like Whiplash and Titanium Man. All this is shown through images between every mission, which use the voices of the actors of the movie like Robert Downey Jr. and Terrence Howard.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "May 2, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "Artificial Mind & Movement", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.62", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Man_(video_game)", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnLRTlkmnmo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/15181-iron-man\n"}
