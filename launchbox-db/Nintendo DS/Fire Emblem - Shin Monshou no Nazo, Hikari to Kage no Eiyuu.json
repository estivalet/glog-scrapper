Graphically and gameplay-wise this game is almost unchanged, though there are some new features. It also adapts the story content from the Satellaview title BS Fire Emblem into four additional story episodes. This is a tactical role-playing game which puts players in the role of a customizable Avatar: their gender, appearance, character class and statistics can be tailored by the player. Missions are split between story-based chapters and optional side chapters: side chapters give access to new playable characters outside the main narrative. Players can save at any time during battles, with the game opening offering a save at the end of each chapter. Outside battles, the player can visit towns to buy supplies and items such as weapons. Characters recruited by the player can also engage in support conversations accessed through the battle menu: these raise a character's support rank and grant boons during battle. How characters connect through supports is documented using a relationship chart.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "July 15, 2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Intelligent Systems", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.88", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_Emblem:_New_Mystery_of_the_Emblem", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkM4NKBnn7k", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/16470-fire-emblem-shin-monshou-no-nazo-hikari-to-kage-no-eiyuu\n"}
