The game includes over 170 puzzles. Professor Layton and the Last Specter also includes an additional role-playing game entitled Professor Layton's London Life, available from the start of the game. London Life, in which players interact with various characters from the series in a town called \"Little London\", was advertised to contain over 100 hours of content. London Life was removed from the European versions of the game in order to prevent a significant delay of the game's release for translation.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "October 17, 2011", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "Brownie Brown", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.05", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor_Layton_and_the_Last_Specter", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCPKuyf8up4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/10264-professor-layton-and-the-last-specter\n"}
