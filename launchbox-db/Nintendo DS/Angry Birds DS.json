{"altername_name": ["Angry Birds DS"], "name": "Angry Birds DS", "overview": "Angry Birds is a 2009 casual puzzle video game developed by Rovio Entertainment. Inspired primarily by a sketch of stylized wingless birds, the game was first released for iOS and Maemo devices in December 2009.[3][4] Since that time, over 12 million copies of the game have been purchased from the iOS App Store,[5] which prompted the developer to design versions for other touchscreen-based smartphones, most notably Android, Symbian, Windows Phone, and BlackBerry 10 devices. The series has since expanded to include titles for dedicated video game consoles and PCs. A sequel, Angry Birds 2, was released in July 2015 for iOS and Android.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "July 13, 2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Jaakko Lisalo", "publishers": "Jaakko Lisalo", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.13", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gr1ADF4bS8w", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/132295-angry-birds-ds\n"}
