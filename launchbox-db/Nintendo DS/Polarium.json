It's the first game that would look cool at a rave. Polarium is a simple, stylish puzzle game you play entirely with the Nintendo DS touch screen and a stylus. Draw lines to flip black and white tiles and make patterns and puzzles disappear. Use the stylus to draw a stroke, flipping black and white tiles to change and match their color. Three game modes and scores of puzzles will put your puzzle-solving abilities and stylus skills to the test.
