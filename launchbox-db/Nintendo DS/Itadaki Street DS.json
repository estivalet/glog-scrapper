{"altername_name": ["Itadaki Street DS: Dragon Quest Super Mario", "\u5bcc\u8c6a\u8857DS"], "name": "Itadaki Street DS", "overview": "Players move around the board, buying shops and collecting money from others who land on their shop spaces. Depending on circumstances, some players can forcibly take over another player's shop spaces, or make them inactive for a turn. Players can also hold shares of a block of spaces so that they get paid when someone lands on any space in that block, even if it is not their own. Players get bonuses for leveling up, which is done by passing four special spaces on the board (each marked with a suit- Club, Diamond, Heart, and Spade) and then going to the Bank space. If the player lands on one of these special spaces instead of passing them, they get a chance to randomly draw a \"chance card\", which affects gameplay or a player. Usually, the goal is to reach a certain total property value and get to the Bank, or to make a player bankrupt. There is also a special \"Casino\" space where themed games of chance occur.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "June 21, 2007", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Square Enix", "publishers": "Square Enix", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDCMzG6RAIg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/93229-itadaki-street-ds\n"}
