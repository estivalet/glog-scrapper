Wario: Master of Disguise opens with our money-mad hero taking a break from being a shady software impresario to watch a TV show about a master thief. Working himself up into a lather of jealousy, Wario leaps through the screen and embarks on his own glamorous globe-trotting career as a thief. With the helpful advice of a mustachioed magic wand named Goodstyle, you'll soon learn how to use your DS stylus to draw specific designs on Wario to give him new costumes. Break into exotic locations, from a luxury liner & watery ruins to an Egyptian pyramid, all in the hopes of grabbing as much treasure and loot as Wario can carry.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "January 18, 2007", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "Suzak", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.71", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wario:_Master_of_Disguise", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB4QRMJYT3I", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/18636-wario-master-of-disguise\n"}
