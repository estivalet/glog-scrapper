{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ico Soccer", "overview": "ICO Soccer reminds me of those classic soccer games on the Amiga 500 and the SNES, not just from the graphics but rather the gameplay which easily allows gamers of all levels the ability to play this title from the get go. Best of all, the developers have ensured that the stylus is not just an afterthought and actually enhances the gaming experience and will have you kicking goals in no time... well, almost. The developers have boasted an old-school approach to this game and even from the opening scene, the game is extremely retro and actually suits the approach they have taken. Gameplay wise, you can start a quick match or start a World Cup mode which is quite short. Getting straight into the mechanics of soccer in this title, the top screen is used to display the gameplay itself and information, with the stylus screen used to control your match. The touch screen is where the game is reminiscent of those classic top-down views with icons displayed for various soccer maneuvers.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "June 26, 2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Artematica Entertainment", "publishers": "Black Bean Games", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/102124-ico-soccer\n"}
