{"altername_name": ["Los Esbirros del Overlord"], "name": "Overlord Minions", "overview": "Meet Giblet, Blaze, Stench, and Zap - an elite Minion crew who, assisted by minion master Gnarl, get star billing in Overlord Minions, an irresistible and accessible puzzle action game, designed exclusively for Nintendo DS. In Overlord Minions, the Overlord commands the Minion team remotely. The Nintendo DS stylus becomes an extension of his evil will and every precise Touch Screen command is the player-as-Overlord directing, commanding and combining minions in battle, pointing and sweeping them to attack enemies and solving puzzles to execute his dastardly plans. Controlling the Special Farces team of four, players negotiate fiendish levels and take on a huge range of warped enemies to hunt down the Kindred, a cult dedicated to resurrecting the mighty Dragon Kin, a race of humanoid dragon hybrids, determined to replace the Overlord's despotism with their own. Extending the Overlord series' trademark humour, gameplay focuses on the mischievous physical comedy of the minion's antics and is delivered in a stylised cartoon visual style.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "June 23, 2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "The Climax Group", "publishers": "Codemasters", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlord:_Minions", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-TPgb76geE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/14667-overlord-minions\n"}
