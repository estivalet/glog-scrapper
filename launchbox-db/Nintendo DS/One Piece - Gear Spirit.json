Characters are controlled using the d-pad to move, the face buttons are used to attack and jump, and special attacks are performed by using cards on the touch screen. Fights consist of four player characters each gaining points from killing another characters via depleting their health or pushing them out of the ring, however, each player loses points for dying. The winner from each round is the player with the most points at the end of the time.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "August 30, 2007", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Matrix Software", "publishers": "Bandai Namco Games", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/18628-one-piece-gear-spirit\n"}
