{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ninja Captains", "overview": "Initially the games must be played through in linear fashion via the \"story mode\" in which the Ninja Captains are revealed to be some sort of inept crime fighters. Seeing a giant robot mouse trashing downtown New York on the television the kitty foursome follow a gizmo that's supposed to point them to where the trouble is, but it's malfunctioning so they take a taxi straight past the monster and board a plane instead. Thus begins a series of air, land and sea journeys that come full circle right back to New York for a final mini-game through the inside of the robot to save the day.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "October 16, 2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "In-house", "publishers": "Nordcurrent", "genres": "Party", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/100286-ninja-captains\n"}
