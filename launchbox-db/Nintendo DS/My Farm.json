{"altername_name": [], "name": "My Farm", "overview": "My Farm is a breeding simulation game! At the beginning, all you own is an empty field, a few pennies and a single little hen... You need to feed the hen and take care of it! Then your hen will lay eggs which can then be sold. And with this money, you can buy new animals at the Farmers\u2019 Market and purchase equipment from the Shopkeeper. Little by little as your farm builds up, you will unlock certain bonuses (wind turbine, rooster, guard dog, tractor, etc.). And you will be able to exchange your animals with your friends who play My Farm or My Exotic Farm!", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "August 23, 2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "BiP Media", "publishers": "BiP media", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/159485-my-farm\n"}
