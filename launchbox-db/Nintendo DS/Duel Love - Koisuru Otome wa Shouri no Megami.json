The story concerns a female protagonist who becomes friends with the (male) members of her high school's boxing club. It is rated C for ages 15 and up by the Japanese board CERO. Primarily a dating sim, the overall goal of the game is to form a relationship with the chosen character.[1] There are also several minigames, in which the player assists the young men in training, cheers them on during matches (which affects their performance), treats their post-fight scrapes and bruises, peeks at them in the shower, gives them back rubs and wipes sweat off their chests. The game has not been announced for regions outside Japan but has received attention by gaming media for its quasi-sexual nature.[2][3][4][5] In fact, in the part of the game which involves boys showering, the entire body is naked and the genitals are hidden by the gap between the top and bottom DS screens.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "March 13, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bandai", "publishers": "Bandai", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/141494-duel-love-koisuru-otome-wa-shouri-no-megami\n"}
