Street Fashion Simulation lets the player take control and manage their own fashion boutique, letting them create their own lines of clothes, accessories and even design hair styles, hire models to sell their products, hiring workers for their stores and placing ads on TV and magazines. Players can also explore and meet friends and random characters to learn about new fashion trends and change accordingly or even meet and hire new potential models.
