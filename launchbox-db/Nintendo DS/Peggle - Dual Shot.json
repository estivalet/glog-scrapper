{"altername_name": [], "name": "Peggle: Dual Shot", "overview": "Peggle: Dual Shot is a Nintendo DS adaptation of the PC action puzzle game Peggle. Players shoot a ball to clear multi-colored pegs and bricks, score points and perform tricks and special moves for extra score. The game features ten Peggle \"Masters\", each showcasing a unique special power (multi-ball, flippers, guided balls, etc.) that players can activate and use in the various levels. The game draws inspiration from pinball, pachinko and Plinko. In this DS-specific version, Peggle: Dual Shot features over 120 game boards (including all the levels from the original Peggle and its sequel Peggle Nights), along with 10 new levels designed by Q Entertainment. There is also a dual-screen \"Bonus Underground\" mode, where players can collect gems and power-ups that unlock the ten new levels. Other game modes are Challenge, with over 90 level-specific challenges to beat, and multiplayer (Duel mode).", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "March 3, 2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Q Entertainment", "publishers": "PopCap Games", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/17063-peggle-dual-shot\n"}
