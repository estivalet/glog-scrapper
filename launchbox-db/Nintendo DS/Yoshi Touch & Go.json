As Yoshi charges across the island, you use the stylus to throw eggs at enemies, lead him to egg-replenishing fruit, and make him jump over danger. On vertical-scrolling levels, you use the stylus to draw clouds to encircle enemies, throw coins, and guide Baby Mario through the dangerous skies. Take on the single-player challenges or compete against a friend using the wireless link of the Nintendo DS.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "March 14, 2005", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Nintendo EAD", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.88", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6614-yoshi-touch-go\n"}
