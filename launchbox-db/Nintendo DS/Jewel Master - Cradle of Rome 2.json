{"altername_name": ["Cradle of Rome 2"], "name": "Jewel Master: Cradle of Rome 2", "overview": "Cradle of Rome 2 is the sequel to Cradle of Rome. Just like its predecessor it is a puzzle game played on a board filled with different items. The objective is to remove all items on blue tiles on the board. This is done by creating a match of three tiles or more with an identical item, horizontally or vertically. Matches with default tiles fill up the board immediately again as everything drops down. To get rid of the blue ones, they must be put into a match. The level is won when all blue tiles are removed before the time runs out.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "October 21, 2011", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Awem Studio", "publishers": "Rising Star Games", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/29397-jewel-master-cradle-of-rome-2\n"}
