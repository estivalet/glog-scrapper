The game takes on and improves many elements from its predecessor, My Year With Holo, without being a direct sequel. Players step into the shoes of series\u2019 protagonist Kraft Lawrence on his adventures with Holo. While travelling north to find information about Holo\u2019s hometown, the two are confronted by a massive channel of water which they cannot cross without passing through strict identity checks, impossible for the wolf-eared Holo to complete. Searching for alternative passage, they meet game-original character Luka (\u30eb\u30ab, Ruka), daughter of a ferryman who is currently missing. Like the first game, gameplay consists of traveling through various locations, trading goods, and making the right choices in romantic events. There are also various new and improved mechanics, such as the inclusion of contracts with strict deadlines for deliveries and a grid-based inventory system. Also new is the inclusion of a third character to travel with, allowing players the opportunity to decide between deepening their relationship with Holo or another heroine of their choice. Possible companions include Norah, a shepherd; Eve, a merchant whose skills are said to outclass Lawrence\u2019s; or new character Luka. Completing all four character routes on the same save slot unlocks the \u2018Endless Mode\u2019 which provides a new postgame quest with no time limit.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "September 17, 2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "ASCII Media Works", "publishers": "ASCII Media Works", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.71", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/129138-ookami-to-koushinryou-umi-wo-wataru-kaze\n"}
