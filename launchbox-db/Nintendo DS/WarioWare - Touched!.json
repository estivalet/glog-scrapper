Now you must complete your goals by using the touch screen and a stylus. Tap, scratch, and rub your stylus on the touch screen to play minigames that have you do everything from milking a cow and drawing a mustache to hurling stars at evil ninjas. You can even play some minigames by blowing into the DS's built-in microphone. The more minigames you clear, the more characters and items you unlock.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "February 14, 2005", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Intelligent Systems", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.23", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WarioWare:_Touched!", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfxBI8ODh-E&ab_channel=GoldMetalSonic", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6611-warioware-touched\n"}
