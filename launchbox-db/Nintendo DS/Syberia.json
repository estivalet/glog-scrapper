{"altername_name": ["B. Sokal Syberia"], "name": "Syberia", "overview": "Syberia is a traditional puzzle-solving adventure, which is somewhat of a rarity on the platform. The player navigates a 3D model of the protagonist over pre-rendered backgrounds with fixed camera angles. Puzzles are mostly inventory-based, though some involve manipulating the environment (such as mechanical devices). The interface features a single cursor; only highlighted objects can be interacted with, and there are no verb choice commands.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Micro\u00efds Canada", "publishers": "DreamCatcher Interactive", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.88", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syberia", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/84805-syberia\n"}
