Kitaro can fire off projectile attacks and glide around by hefting an makeshift \"parachute\" over himself to traverse wide distances and platforms.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Bandai", "publishers": "Bandai Namco", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/130193-gegege-no-kitarou-youkai-daigekisen\n"}
