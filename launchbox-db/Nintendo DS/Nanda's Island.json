{"altername_name": [], "name": "Nanda's Island", "overview": "Nanda the Panda lives on an island where the plant life has all but dried up; luckily, she's just learned a fancy new rain dance, but the darn thing only forms those live-giving storm clouds adjacent to where they're needed. It's up to you to draw lines with the stylus to guide droplets to their destination, creating thin neon green surfaces along which the water moves just like on any other ledge. You'll also grow plants that teleport, spray or drip water after collecting it as you guide it to the goal, as well as encounter other obstacles like hot, evaporation-causing surfaces.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/100372-nandas-island\n"}
