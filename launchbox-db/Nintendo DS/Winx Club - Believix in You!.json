{"altername_name": [], "name": "Winx Club: Believix in You!", "overview": "In this game we encounter the Winx in the fourth season. The Winx come to Earth to find the last fairy and to make humans believe in magic so that they can earn their Believix. The Believix is the new transformation in the fourth season. They have three additional wings: Speedix (super speed), Zoomix (teleportation), and Tracix (visual aids). When a fairy earns her Believix, she gains the ability to make someone believe in magic. The villains in this season are the Wizards of the Black Circle, also known as the Fairy Hunters. They stole the magic from Earth, causing humans to stop believing in it. The Wizards need Roxy, the last fairy on Earth, who has the power of animals, to gain full power. But, from episode 8 onwards, their target switches to the White Circle, a magical ring in which the fairies from Earth were trapped. There are two other new transformations in the fourth season. First, there is Sophix, a nature-based power-up to Believix. The second is Lovix, a winter-based power-up to Believix.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/103999-winx-club-believix-in-you\n"}
