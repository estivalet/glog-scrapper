{"altername_name": [], "name": "Robot Rescue 2", "overview": "If you\u2019re tired of brain-bending logic games that your baby brother can solve, then you need Robot Rescue 2! The rules may be simple, but finding success isn't quite so easy. Your mission: navigate a cadre of codependent robots through an evil computer labyrinth brimming with deadly traps. Additionally, at certain points you\u2019ll need to repaint your robots by stepping on a special tile in order to change their colour. Only then will they be able to access the right exit or passage. Oh, and did we mention that the robots share linked controls? Moving one moves them all! Bust out your best thinking cap: it\u2019ll take patience, planning and nerves of titanium to see your robots home safely!", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "October 10, 2012", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Teyon", "publishers": "Teyon", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/160106-robot-rescue-2\n"}
