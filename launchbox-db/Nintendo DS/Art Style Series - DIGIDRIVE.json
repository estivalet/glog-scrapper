{"altername_name": ["Art Style: INTERSECT"], "name": "Art Style Series: DIGIDRIVE", "overview": "The objective of the game is to propel the disc-shaped corevto as many meters as possible before the piston collides into the core and ends the game. The player must direct up to three different varieties of \"vehicle,\" each of a different color, into one of four different lanes. If five of the same vehicle fill up the same lane, a triangle will appear and the lane will change to the same color as the type of vehicle that entered this lane. Once the player get all five cars of the same color in all four directions, it results in an overdrive, where they can send vehicles of their color in the direction of that color before the color in that direction goes away, but once the vehicle goes in the right direction, it fills that direction up. Overdrive ends when either a vehicle goes in the direction that does not match the color, or if a direction did not have a vehicle of that color in that direction in the last few seconds.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "October 2, 2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Q-Games", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersect_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/85256-art-style-series-digidrive\n"}
