As a member of the Earth Rescue Team (ERT), your mission is to save the wildlife on a beautiful island that has been threatened by pollution. There are penguins and pandas; elephants and eagles; lions, tigers and bears; and even a crocodile for good measure. The game casts you as a new animal doctor recruited to practice veterinary medicine in a diverse nature preserve filled with exotic endangered creatures, with no normal household dogs or cats in sight. Every time you treat an animal, you'll be in store for an experience more similar to something you'd see on the Discovery Channel than anything you'd find in your local pet store.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "November 11, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "Frontline Studios", "publishers": "Legacy Interactive", "genres": "Life Simulation", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/80340-zoo-vet-endangered-animals\n"}
