The story revolves around a urban legend about a cursed nameless RPG for the fictional TS portable game system (an analogy for the Nintendo DS) which kills anyone who plays it and doesn't complete it within seven days. The player starts the game investigating the mysterious absence of his university classmate, who sent him the cursed RPG game. While playing the game, the player will encounter zombie-like creatures called Regrets (\u30eb\u30b0\u30ec, Rugure in Japanese) which represent the main threat of the game. The player will also need to solve various puzzles in order to progress the game story. The game uses two separate modes of play: the real world part, which is the main part of the game, is played through a real-time 3D perspective holding the DS vertically, using both the DS's screens and the touch screen input, while the cursed game part is played holding the DS horizontally through the standard d-pad and action buttons combination, and resembles a classic 2D JRPG 8-bit style game (reminiscent of the first Final Fantasy).", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "July 3, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Epics", "publishers": "Square Enix", "genres": "Horror", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanashi_no_Game", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73980-nanashi-no-game\n"}
