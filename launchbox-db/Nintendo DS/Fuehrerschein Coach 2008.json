{"altername_name": [], "name": "Fuehrerschein Coach 2008", "overview": "Driver's License Coach 2008 for Nintendo DS reliably and playfully prepares learner drivers for the theoretical driver's license test. The user creates his own profile, in which he selects the driver's license class relevant to him and can track his progress there. The personal profile also offers a driving license checklist with a reminder function. In this way, the learner driver is reminded of everything he has to do before his test, e.g.: take a first aid course and have an eye test carried out. In Driver's License Coach 2008 for Nintendo DS, the user is reminded of upcoming appointments by the charming coach CARo. Once a day, a realistic, theoretical driver's license test can be simulated in terms of scope and time in order to prove what has been practiced before. The number of questions in the exercise section is determined by the learner driver himself. In between, the learner can distract himself from the upcoming exam stress with the sign game.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "0.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/163047-fuehrerschein-coach-2008\n"}
