{"altername_name": [], "name": "Unsolved Crimes", "overview": "The game is set in New York City. The player is a rookie detective from the homicide division. There are eight cases in the game, and one larger case divided into sections. In this case, a model named Betsy Blake goes missing. She is the sister of the player's partner, Marcy Blake. The DS offers a variety of things on the touch screen. Memos, evidence, profiles of suspects and movements are done through the touch screen. In almost every case players must answer queries. These are often multiple-choice. If the player answers wrong they lose confidence from their partner. The game is over when Marcy loses trust in them completely, or when all cases are solved. In one case, some queries can be skipped. However, all queries must be answered to unlock a case after the player finds Betsy.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "September 30, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Now Production", "publishers": "Empire Interactive Entertainment", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsolved_Crimes", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/98211-unsolved-crimes\n"}
