In the game you play as Pippi. It starts inside Villa Villekulla, after which it moves on to the neighbourhood, to the town, and then on to the circus. Throughout the game Pippi helps people she meets by finding things they need or want. The menu shows you the tasks you have to complete and the things you must find in order to move on to the next level in the game. Sometimes you need the help of Pippi's monkey Mr. Nilsson, and at other times you have to carry boxes to where you need them to get to high places in order to reach the things you need. Occasionally you get to compete with your friends.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "September 28, 2012", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Ravn Studio", "publishers": "PAN Vision AB", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/99974-pippi-longstocking\n"}
