The objective is simply to find the keys hidden around the game. To do this, you will have to work out the meaning of the hints in each level. You can play the game using the stylus only. Most of the hints in the game are helpful and may require you to think about the time of the day, game functions like tapping or dragging or the principle of opening or closing. Make sure you examine the most minute details very carefully, including the name of a level or even a tiny flower!", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "August 2, 2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Circle Entertainment", "publishers": "CIRCLE Entertainment", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/160050-hints-hunter\n"}
