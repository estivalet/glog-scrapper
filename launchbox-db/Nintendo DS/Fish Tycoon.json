{"altername_name": [], "name": "Fish Tycoon", "overview": "Fish Tycoon is a software toy of sorts, in which you control a tank of fish. To allow them to thrive and remain healthy, there are several upgrades which can be purchased, ranging from fish vitamins to fungal treatments to atmosphere-improving plants. They must also be fed, by dragging the food into the tank. Money can also be spent on improving your fish knowledge and business ability. The player has limited money, which can be topped up by selling fully-grown fish. The ultimate aim on each level is to cross-breed the fish in such a way as to reveal one of the many types of Magic Fish. These are especially valuable to sell, and can help you finance a better tank. However, they can be very environment-dependent, so keep research in mind. The game takes place in real-time, even while not running, so make sure to leave adequate food if you will be away from it for a length of time.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "October 16, 2007", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Aquaria Interactive", "publishers": "Majesco Entertainment Company", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.62", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/79632-fish-tycoon\n"}
