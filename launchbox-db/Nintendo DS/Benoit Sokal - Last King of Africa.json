{"altername_name": [], "name": "Benoit Sokal: Last King of Africa", "overview": "One of the world's best PC adventure game creators is going handheld, as Focus Home Interactive and White Birds announce Beno\u00eet Sokal's Last King of Africa for the Nintendo DS. While Sokal is probably best known for Syberia and Syberia 2, The Last King of Africa is a remake of the Ubisoft-published title Paradise, which tells the story of Ann Smith, the daughter of the king of a fictional African country who loses her memory in a plane crash en route to her seriously ill father's side. The game has been reworked to take advantage of the DS's touch and microphone capabilities to solve puzzles, while the story has received tweaking to make it more coherent and enjoyable. Focus has also stripped the 3D action sequences from the game, making for a more traditional point and click adventure.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "November 14, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "White Birds Productions", "publishers": "Ubisoft", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/101654-benoit-sokal-last-king-of-africa\n"}
