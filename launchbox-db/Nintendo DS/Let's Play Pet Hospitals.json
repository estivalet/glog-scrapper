{"altername_name": ["30 Millions d'Amis: Mon Refuge Pour Animaux"], "name": "Let's Play Pet Hospitals", "overview": "Let's Play Pet Hospitals is a pet care simulation video game produced by Portuguese studio Biodroid Productions and published by Deep Silver for the Nintendo DS and Microsoft Windows. Let's Play Pet Hospitals is full of interesting facts regarding different kinds of pets and their specific needs. Animals which have either run away or been abandoned, and may therefore be undernourished, ungroomed, and sick, are brought to the pet hospital. There, the player will need to take care of them and find them new homes, or return them to their original owners. PC or Nintendo DS vets will receive money for successful treatment, advising customers, and thus finding good homes for the pets under their care. This money can be used to build new condos and improve the pet center, for example by painting the walls, renewing the flooring and purchasing new furniture, or even clothes for the player character.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "February 27, 2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Biodroid Productions", "publishers": "Deep Silver", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sAIjACiF8s", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/101856-lets-play-pet-hospitals\n"}
