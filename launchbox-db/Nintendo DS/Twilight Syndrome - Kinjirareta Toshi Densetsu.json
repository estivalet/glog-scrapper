It was created by Human Entertainment and continued by Spike after Human folded in the late 1990s. The games generally follow high school girls investigating urban legends about ghosts and other paranormal happenings in their school and neighborhood. The first two games were directed by Goichi Suda and released for the PlayStation in 1996. Suda entered the position partway through development and thus did not have much creative input. He was more deeply involved with the next game in the series, Moonlight Syndrome, but left Human shortly after to found his own company, Grasshopper Manufacture. The series was retained by Spike, which released a spiritual sequel in the form of Yuuyami Doori Tankentai, before releasing two more Twilight Syndrome games, one for the PlayStation in 2000 and a Nintendo DS game in 2008. The games have been praised for their atmosphere and realistic 3D sound. Three live-action films based on the series have been released in Japan.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "September 24, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Spike", "publishers": "Spike", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/141782-twilight-syndrome-kinjirareta-toshi-densetsu\n"}
