{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sonic & SEGA All-Stars Racing", "overview": "Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing is a kart racing video game, part of the Sega Superstars series, featuring characters from Sega franchises. Characters race through various race circuits themed on different Sega franchises and collect power-ups to boost their speed or hamper their opponents. The items have a rock-paper-scissors effect, in which certain items can be used to defend against others. Like Sumo's previous Sega game, Sega Superstars Tennis, each character has a special ability (called an \"All-Star Move\") unique to them that they may use to their advantage (such as Sonic transforming into Super Sonic and AiAi riding in his monkey ball), which they can obtain if they are running behind in the race.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "February 23, 2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Sumo Digital", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.78", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_%26_Sega_All-Stars_Racing", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/16143-sonic-sega-all-stars-racing\n"}
