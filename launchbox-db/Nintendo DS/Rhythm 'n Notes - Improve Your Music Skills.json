{"altername_name": ["Tenohira Gakushuu: Zettai Onkan Training DS"], "name": "Rhythm 'n Notes: Improve Your Music Skills", "overview": "Rhythm 'n Notes presents a variety of lessons aimed at teaching or reinforcing several core music skills; namely recognizing notes and time signatures. The first focuses on an on screen piano that will play a note or a cord which the player must then replicate, the game demands perfection though, so it may take a while to pass. The other aspect of the training is played out by the player tapping a beat out on a percussion instrument, i.e. a soda can or a taiko. Lessons are followed by identical tests to see what you managed to retain in your mind and ear. The game is hosted by a bouncy anim\u00e9, Tsunami, who will play along with you on the instruments and offer encouragement.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "October 23, 2007", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "IE Institute Co., Ltd.", "publishers": "Agetec", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/99115-rhythm-n-notes-improve-your-music-skills\n"}
