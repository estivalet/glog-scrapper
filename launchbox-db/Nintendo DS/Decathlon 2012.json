{"altername_name": [], "name": "Decathlon 2012", "overview": "10 games in one: 100m sprint, long jump, shot put, high jump, 400m run, 110m hurdles, discus, pole vault, javelin throw, and finally the exhausting 1500m. In each discipline you control your athlete simply with the stylus, but you won\u2019t succeed without proper timing, speed and stamina management. Results achieved in individual disciplines are stored in a table and compared with the best world scores. The total score in the decathlon is calculated using a real-world formula, thus it is possible to accurately compare your score not only to the world record but also to the other athletes participating in the competition, including up to three friends with whom you take turns during the game. Enjoy a stylish design which naturally complements the great playability of original sports games, but this time you don't have to worry about breaking your joystick. During the track events you have to move the stylus with the correct frequency and not waste your stamina. When jumping, you have to attain the necessary speed and time your take-off correctly, and when throwing you won\u2019t succeed without totally concentrating on your technique. Only one athlete will get the gold medal for their country!", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "July 25, 2012", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Cinemax", "publishers": "Cinemax", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/159763-decathlon-2012\n"}
