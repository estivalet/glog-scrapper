{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tony Hawk's Proving Ground", "overview": "Tony Hawk's Proving Ground is a video game developed by Vicarious Visions for the Nintendo DS, by Neversoft for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and by Page 44 Studios for the PlayStation 2 and Wii. Proving Ground is the ninth installment in the Tony Hawk's series, and the last to be developed by Neversoft as the franchise was then transferred to Robomodo. Proving Ground was not as successful as Project 8 (2006). When it debuted in 2007, critics were hesitant about its controls, despite receiving praise for its visuals and audio. Amidst this somewhat lackluster reception, it was a financial success. The Xbox 360 version in America came with a demo of Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock, which was released on October 28, 2007. Proving Ground was the last game in the main series of Tony Hawk games for 8 years until Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5 in 2015.[2]", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "October 15, 2007", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "Vicarious Visions", "publishers": "Activision", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfhjyrQn5Dg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/24582-tony-hawks-proving-ground\n"}
