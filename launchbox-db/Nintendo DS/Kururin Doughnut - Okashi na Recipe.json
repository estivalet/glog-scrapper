{"altername_name": [], "name": "Kururin Doughnut: Okashi na Recipe", "overview": "Some cookie bears decided to take the Rainbow Candy treasure and now its up to the player controlling a sentient doughnut to get it back. Players control the doughnut by making circular motions with the stylus since the doughnut moves with a rolling bounce through the levels. The idea of the game is to get the doughnut through the levels as fast as possible while collecting stars (little stars count as one while big stars count as ten) and avoiding falling into pits. Collecting 100 of these stars will earn the player an extra life. At the end of each stage the player receives a grade which is based on how fast they were and by how many items were collected. The doughnut is aided by getting power-up toppings. Chopped nuts allow walls to be broken through, chocolate glaze lets the doughnut roll faster,. and Jelly which makes it sticky. The game also contains some pastry recipes and photos of cookies being made to unlock", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "July 5, 2007", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Global A Entertainment", "publishers": "Global A Entertainment", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/141593-kururin-doughnut-okashi-na-recipe\n"}
