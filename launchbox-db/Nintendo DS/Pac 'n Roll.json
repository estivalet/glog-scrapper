{"altername_name": ["Pac 'n Ball", "\u6eda\u6eda\u5403\u8c46"], "name": "Pac 'n Roll", "overview": "Pac-Land has been attacked by the legendary ghost Golvis. With the help of a fairy, Pac-Man must save the world and free his friends. Using the touchscreen, players roll Pac-Man similarly to using a trackball. Guide him through 3D levels collecting pac-dots, avoiding ghosts or eating them with power pellets. There are 2 new power-ups - a feather hat which makes Pac-Man float and heavy armour which allows Pac-Man to go underwater. As well as the story mode, each level can be played as in time attack and challenge modes. Challenges require the player to finish a level in a different way, such as avoiding all pac-dots.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "August 23, 2005", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Namco", "publishers": "Namco", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.81", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac_'n_Roll", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/82179-pac-n-roll\n"}
