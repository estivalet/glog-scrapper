It provides definitions for Japanese and English words in Japanese, using an intuitive hand-written interface for word look-up. There is a flashcard mode where a user can practice their kanji, and it also interfaces with Pictochat for use of the dictionary during conversations. As a bonus, there are also several recreations of Nintendo's Game & Watch games present, which can be found and played by entering their names into the dictionary. Included are Ball (\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb), Flagman (\u30d5\u30e9\u30c3\u30b0\u30de\u30f3), Judge (\u30b8\u30e3\u30c3\u30b8), and Manhole (\u30de\u30f3\u30db\u30fc\u30eb).", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "April 13, 2006", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Nintendo", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji_Sonomama_Rakubiki_Jiten_DS", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5ap8XkL-2g", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/82890-kanji-sonomama-rakubiki-jiten-ds\n"}
