{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tom and Jerry Tales", "overview": "In Tom and Jerry Tales, the player takes on the role of Jerry on a mission to defeat Tom and leave him a mess to clean up! Jerry starts at his mouse-hole and is offered a map to choose a level from. Each level has four game modes: Touch Time, Time, Speed and Break. Touch Time is the main game mode and what the player has to do is use the buttons to move Jerry around and use the stylus to touch the screen to make Jerry do his tricks. Time game mode tests how fast the player can reach the goals. You try to collect as many rings as possible in Speed game mode. In Break game mode, Jerry must collect cheeses and throw things at every object seen on the way. There is a Gameboy Advance version of this game. Although they were made at the same time and by the same company, they differ from each other in graphics and content.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "October 31, 2006", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Sensory Sweep", "publishers": "Warner Bros.
