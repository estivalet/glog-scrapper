Another scene shows Amitie and Arle pledging to play by the rules, and Sig, still as clueless as ever, eventually plegdes as well, but not before witnessing six comets fall down onto Earth. Sig, realising that this is a big discovery, decides to ignore it anyhow and goes onto the competition. It turns out that the \"comets\" are actually six familiar characters from the Madou series, who serve as boss characters in the story modes.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "December 14, 2006", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sonic Team", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "8", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puyo_Puyo!_15th_Anniversary", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/28045-puyo-puyo-15th-anniversary\n"}
