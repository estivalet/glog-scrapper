Every scene is accompanied by rump-shaking tunes, but players have to keep the Elite Beat Agents grooving. Rhythm games have come and gone, but no one has ever seen anything like the Elite Beat Agents!", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "November 8, 2006", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "iNiS", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Music", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.10", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite_Beat_Agents", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CHUDhIOicQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6505-elite-beat-agents\n"}
