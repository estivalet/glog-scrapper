{"altername_name": [], "name": "Knights in the Nightmare", "overview": "Somewhere between heaven and the underworld--in the center of a quiet lake--stood an ancient castle known as Aventheim. One night, without warning, denizens of the netherworld emerged and slaughtered the kingdom; nary a soul was left alive. Within an abandoned, long-forgotten church deep in the woods, a wisp is set free. Bereft of memory, it is drawn toward a monster-infested castle and re-awakens the souls of vanquished knights, leading them back towards the fallen stronghold to confront the very forces of evil that took their lives.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "June 3, 2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Sting", "publishers": "Atlus", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.14", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_in_the_Nightmare", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHipn3h8PWY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/10843-knights-in-the-nightmare\n"}
