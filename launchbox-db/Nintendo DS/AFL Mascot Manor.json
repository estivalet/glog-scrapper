{"altername_name": [], "name": "AFL Mascot Manor", "overview": "Toby, a young footy-loving boy, accidentally finds himself himself transported to the Outerworld - the bizarre netherworld that houses AFL mascots in between games. Ordinarily they spend their time waging vicious battles between each other to win the favour of Australian children; this time, they find themselves fighting over Toby. The player takes control of one of sixteen Australian Football League (AFL) mascots. The gameplay is standard 3D platforming; players start in a world themed after their own team, and then move on through worlds themed after each other mascot with the goal of conquering them all. All sixteen of the mascots play essentially identically; each is a heavy character who can run, jump, and punch. Players are also able to collect digital versions of Select AFL trading cards scattered throughout the levels. AFL Mascot Manor was released alongside the nearly-identical NRL Mascot Mania, which features very similar gameplay and a National Rugby League mascot theme.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "June 26, 2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Wicked Witch Software", "publishers": "Tru Blu Games", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/79370-afl-mascot-manor\n"}
