Gamers play the game by holding the Nintendo DS as though it were a book, similar to Brain Age. The touch screen displays the melody at the top that you must follow, and the three bars below represent the different note 'types' that you can play - either by tapping, or by sliding the stylus along the note (depending on the difficulty level). Based on the accuracy of the note press, you'll be awarded \"GOOD\", \"KIRA\u00b2\" \"RAINBOW\", or \"MISS\" if you fail to hit it. A story mode is included, where the player progresses by completing songs and unlocking new ones for play. They also earn money, which can be used to purchase clothes and accessories for their in-game avatar to wear. There are also photo booths where the avatar can pose in a variety of ways for the camera.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "October 26, 2006", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Dimple Entertainment", "publishers": "505 Games", "genres": "Music", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjesmPf_mDo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/48008-kira-kira-pop-princess\n"}
