Any ghost created with the ink ends up just as mischievous as the magician. Ink ghosts have invaded books and paintings, causing trouble within those realms, and now it's up to Pac-Man to wipe out the ghost problem by using the \"Ghost Pen,\" a device that allows him to enter the infested books and paintings to clear out the bad guys. Pac-Pix is a game tailored specifically for the Nintendo DS' system capabilities. By drawing Pac-Man characters in a specific fashion (the mouth first, then the circle, all in one swoop), the drawing will come to life and munch anything in his path. Players can maneuver Pac-Man drawings in different directions by plotting pathways on the screen for the scribble to follow.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "April 26, 2005", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Namco", "publishers": "Namco", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.8", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baY1ArmnWp8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27527-pac-pix\n"}
