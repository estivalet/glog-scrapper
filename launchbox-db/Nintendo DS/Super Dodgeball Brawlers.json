The original mode still exists, but now has new rules that allow punching, kicking and using weapons against the opposing team. There is a create-a-character option as well. There are also over a hundred special attacks that can be used against opponents such as Cactus Attack, Panda Shot and Spear to name a few. The new Super Gauge System, when filled, can be given to a player on the court to boosts stats or unleash an \"Instant Kill\" against an opponent. Friends can go head-to-head against a friend or even join up against eight people using Wi-Fi.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "March 19, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Access", "publishers": "Arc System Works", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "8", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Dodgeball_Brawlers", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_LU_NcNxUA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/44011-super-dodgeball-brawlers\n"}
