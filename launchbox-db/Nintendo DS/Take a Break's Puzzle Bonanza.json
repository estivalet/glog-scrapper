{"altername_name": [], "name": "Take a Break's Puzzle Bonanza", "overview": "'Take A Break's Puzzle Bonanza' is a collection of puzzles based on the British puzzling magazine series. It is very similar to 'Take A Break's Puzzle Master' for the same platform, except that a new 'Time Trial Mode' is the main mode of gameplay instead of collecting trophies to achieve a Puzzle Master rank. The Picture Poser puzzles can now also be played at any time rather than being just unlocked as bonuses. Like its predecessor, Puzzle Bonanza utilises the Nintendo DS stylus to write word letters, type them in using the game's keyboard layout, or even by dragging letters from the keyboard. The two modes of gameplay are Time Trial Mode (see if you can solve the puzzles within the target time) and Free Play Mode (where you can solve any puzzle you like without any restrictions). 'Take A Break's Puzzle Bonanza' now also allows the player to save puzzle progress at any time by selecting it from the Pause Menu (press Start during a puzzle). Hints are also available, but also include a time penalty to your puzzle completion time.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/99813-take-a-breaks-puzzle-bonanza\n"}
