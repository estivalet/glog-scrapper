An enhanced port to the PlayStation Portable featuring additional content and titled Tokimeki Memorial Girl's Side Premium ~3rd Story~ was released in 2012. This game was the first game in the Tokimeki Memorial series to be released on PSP. The game features all the additions that were made to the first two games in their DS versions, but adds new features like the 3P mode, where the main character can date two of the boys at the same time; or the Pride vs Pride mode, where two boys in 3P mode will fight over the main character. The Premium version added a new character, Tatsuya, renewed graphics with a 2D animation system, and the \"Boys' Life\", mode, where the player can watch super-deformed versions of the main male characters interact with their bedrooms. This is also the first Girl's Side game where there isn't Rival Mode.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "June 24, 2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Life Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/33253-tokimeki-memorial-girls-side-3rd-story\n"}
