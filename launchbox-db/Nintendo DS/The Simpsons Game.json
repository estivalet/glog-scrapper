Each of the Simpsons are playable in this sidescroller action game and feature their own wacky, special abilities. Homer can transform into a large blob and roll his way through levels. Bart can don a cowl and cape and become Bartman, using his slingshot and gliding ability to overcome the game's goons. Lisa can use an all-touchscreen Hand of Buddha to solve puzzles and remove obstacles from her path, and Marge can control mobs to overwhelm anyone who stands in her way. Each of the game's twelve episodes parodies some bit of precious popular culture, including spoofs of such classic videogames as Frogger, Space Invaders, Pok\u00e9mon, and Madden. The game is chock full of video and voice overs featuring the original cast and written by the show writers. The voices, story, and cutscenes means the game's irreverent humor include plenty of references for Simpsons fanatics who will catch all the inside jokes from old episodes. Exclusive to the DS game is \"Pet Homer,\" a sort of virtual pet game where the player collects various items to feed to Homer (and watch the crazy outcome), as well as several multiplayer minigames.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "October 30, 2007", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Griptonite Games", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.45", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons_Game", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/16033-the-simpsons-game\n"}
