{"altername_name": ["George de la Jungla"], "name": "George of the Jungle and the Search for the Secret", "overview": "George of the Jungle and the Search for the Secret is a video game based on the animated television program George of the Jungle. The game is in 3D but plays like a 2D side scrolling platformer game with 3D turns and camera angles in the environment and the path that George walks on. There are a total of 6 levels; 2 with a jungle theme, 2 with a swamp theme, and 2 with temple theme. All 6 levels are made to look like the cartoon series (the 2007 remake, not the original 1960s version). Not once in the game do they specify what the secret actually is.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "March 11, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "7 Studios", "publishers": "Ignition Entertainment", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_of_the_Jungle_and_the_Search_for_the_Secret", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/84326-george-of-the-jungle-and-the-search-for-the-secret\n"}
