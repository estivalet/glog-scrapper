The main objective is to collect several key objects from the castle grounds, to solve puzzles and free the castle folk. The castle can be explored in a typical point-and-click manner, where each location is represented by an static image of the scenery, and the player moves from room to room by clicking on the exit hotspots, usually placed over obvious and logical areas like doors and entrances. Some portions of the building are locked, and can only be accessed after solving one of the puzzles.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "September 3, 2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Gogii Games", "publishers": "Destineer", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/99943-princess-isabella-a-witchs-curse\n"}
