It's the 20th mothership title of the Shining series (not counting remakes) and was released in Japan on February 19, 2009. Produced by Yoichi Shimosato and featuring character designs by Noizi Ito and movie cutscenes made by famous animation studio Gonzo, it was the first Shining Force game to be released on the Nintendo DS. It is also one of the few recent games using the Shining name to return to the series' tactical roots, whereas many of the others after Shining Force 3 were either action-RPGs or standard turn-based JRPGs. According to the official player's guide for the game, a Wii version was planned but ultimately scrapped in favor of the DS version.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "February 19, 2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "Flight-Plan", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shining_Force_Feather", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DluaZHkFTN8&ab_channel=neXGam", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/10637-shining-force-feather\n"}
