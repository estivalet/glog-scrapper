{"altername_name": [], "name": "Kurikin: Nano Island Story", "overview": "You play as a student (either male or female) at Nano Academy, a school located on Nano Island. This island is home to an abundance of around 100 species of bacteria. There are three types of bacteria: Solid (\u30bd\u30ea\u30c3\u30c9), Edge (\u30a8\u30c3\u30b8), and Veil (\u30f4\u30a7\u30fc\u30eb). To collect them, you must use the stylus to absorb a small amount of living matter in certain areas around Nano Island, like plants, dirt, water and even man-made objects. When one kind is found, the bacteria can be raised and then used in battle. Sometimes when two different species of bacteria touch each other during battles, they create a new species. The game includes a story mode for single players. Each of the 24 chapters starts off by giving you a mission. With your goal all set, you head off on a search of the island to speak to people and gather information. As you advance through the missions, you'll end up getting in battle with rival bacteria.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "May 24, 2007", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nintendo", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/141592-kurikin-nano-island-story\n"}
