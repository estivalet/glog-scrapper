{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Oregon Trail", "overview": "Become a pioneer and make the famous crossing across America! Travel with fellow pioneers as you make your way across the Oregon Trail, encountering settlers, river crossings, hunting and other hardships. Manage your supplies or you just might find that your trip will end early! The Oregon Trail is a remake that is loosely based on the educational game of the same name. Whereas the original game was a more realistic simulation of the hardships and difficulty of making the Oregon Trail, teaching children just how difficult the trip was, the Gameloft version of the game takes a much more \"video game\" approach with a simplified interface and an assortment of mini-games, such as panning for gold, fishing, and a telegraph mini-game styled after \"Whack-a-Mole\". At random points on your trip, American political figures talk to you and sometimes challenge you to a race to a certain location. There are also educational factoids that pop up during loading screens.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "December 28, 2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "Gameloft", "publishers": "Gameloft", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oregon_Trail_(2009_video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8Kc0P2zuY0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/170138-the-oregon-trail\n"}
