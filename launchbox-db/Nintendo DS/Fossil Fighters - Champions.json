{"altername_name": ["Super Kaseki Horider"], "name": "Fossil Fighters: Champions", "overview": "In this dino-tastic adventure, players get some hands-on time to hunt and clean fossils, and revive and battle vivosaurs. A fossil park is hosting a large-scale tournament in which competitors enter vivosaurs created from dinosaur fossils into competition. Fossil Fighters from all over the world battle their vivosaurs against one another to find out who will be crowned champion. Players excavate and clean fossils. New giant fossil rocks (containing complete dinosaur fossils) and odd fossil rocks (which are two-sided) add to the fun of the cleaning process.Once the fossils have been cleaned, they can be revived into Vivosaurs, which players can then arrange into teams for battles. The better the fossils have been cleaned, the more powerful the Vivosaurs are in battle. Strategy is key in battles. Players must put forth teams of three vivosaurs, then rotate their positions to maximize their power advantage over opponents.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "November 14, 2011", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "ArtDink", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.42", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/14055-fossil-fighters-champions\n"}
