{"altername_name": ["Looney Tunes: Cartoon Concerto", "Looney Tunes: Musica Animada", "Looney Tunes: Cartoon Concerto"], "name": "Looney Tunes: Cartoon Conductor", "overview": "Looney Tunes: Cartoon Conductor (known as Looney Tunes: Cartoon Concerto in Europe and Australia) is a Nintendo DS game developed by Amaze Entertainment and published by Eidos Interactive. The Tasmanian Devil has gone berserk in the old Looney Tunes cartoon archives, and all the classic shorts have had their music mangled! It's up to the player to recompose the music on these classics before the public notices the damage. Cartoon Conductor is a rhythm-music game that puts the player in the role of a conductor. The player must use sweeping stylus motions to \"conduct\" the classic music as the cartoon plays on the top screen and reacts to the player's abilities. The game features classical music, including selections from Beethoven, Rossini, and Wagner, and cameos all the famous Looney Tunes characters such as Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Yosemite Sam, and Porky Pig, and more. As the game progresses, players can unlock new songs (including techno remixes), expert difficulty modes, and trivia about the songs and the original cartoons.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "June 6, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Amaze Entertainment", "publishers": "Eidos Interactive", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looney_Tunes:_Cartoon_Conductor", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/77480-looney-tunes-cartoon-conductor\n"}
