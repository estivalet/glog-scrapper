You\u2019re on a deserted dream-island somewhere in the Caribbean. The biggest adventure of our time begins here \u2026 although you are only here on vacation and finally want to find your one true love! Then there is a kidnapping, murder.

You take to the search and find a dark secret, the key to the biggest treasury ever created by human hands. You have barely endured the one adventure, when your job as star journalist brings you into a region that couldn\u2019t be more different: 10,000 kilometres further east, Europe, Berlin... Seemingly normal objects are hidden everywhere and at first glance are hardly visible. Touch the objects that are on your search list.
