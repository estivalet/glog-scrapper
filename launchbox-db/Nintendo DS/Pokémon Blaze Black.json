In addition, BB/VW also have edited trainers, an increased difficulty level, improvements to many Pok\u00e9mon and more. They are the spiritual successor of my two other hacks, Pok\u00e9mon Fire Red Omega and Pok\u00e9mon Spirit Gold. Blaze Black and Volt White were also - with one minor exception - the first of their kind to be made.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "March 28, 2011", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Drayano", "publishers": "", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.63", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/94821-pokemon-blaze-black\n"}
