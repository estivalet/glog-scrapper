{"altername_name": ["\u72ac\u795e\u5bb6\u4e00\u65cf"], "name": "Inugamike No Ichizoku", "overview": "Inugamike no Ichizoku (\u72ac\u795e\u5bb6\u306e\u4e00\u65cf) is a detective visual novel based on the novel by Seishi Yokomizo (\u6a2a\u6e9d \u6b63\u53f2) first released in 1950 which was also adapted to a movie, twice, first in 1976, then again in 2006. The game uses a monochromatic ink painting style for characters and locations alike, which gives it a unique look and atmosphere. The story has variations and alterations so even people who read the original work will not go through just a visual and less lengthy representation of a book. The player is cast in a role of Kousuke Kandaichi (\u91d1\u7530\u4e00 \u8015\u52a9), a fictional Japanese detective (like Sherlock Holmes or Conan Edogawa) who is on a trail of a serial killer. The game allows story branching based on player's choices which can make the story deviate from that in the original mystery novel.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "January 22, 2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "FromSoftware", "publishers": "FromSoftware", "genres": "Visual Novel", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/132330-inugamike-no-ichizoku\n"}
