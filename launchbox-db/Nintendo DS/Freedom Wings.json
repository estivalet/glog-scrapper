{"altername_name": ["Ore no Sentouki", "\u6211\u7684\u6218\u6597\u673a"], "name": "Freedom Wings", "overview": "As a man living in the island cities of Sorgele, air pirates loom over the population. They shot down your parents and you are out to avenge their deaths and kill the pirate responsible. This game is an action flight sim with a twist - it also has RPG elements. Each enemy plane you shoot down earns your experience points and gold, which unlocks better parts and planes for you to buy. Occasionally during flight you receive mayday calls from other planes under attack - if you are able to save them you can meet them back at the nearest airfield for a reward. If the action is too much for you to handle, it has an autopilot mode which allows you to select targets and waypoints via the touchscreen. There is also a 4 player multicard mode where you can go head to head with friends.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "2006", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "Natsume", "publishers": "Natsume", "genres": "Flight Simulator", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.8", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_Wings", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30GeHjv5D3k", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/18621-freedom-wings\n"}
