{"altername_name": ["Harry Potter: Die Jahre 1-4", "LEGO Harry Potter: A\u00f1os 1-4"], "name": "LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4", "overview": "LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4 is the first installment of the Harry Potter series in LEGO form. Spanning the first four years of the Harry Potter franchise, players take control of a wide variety of characters and relive famous moments from the first four books; Sorcerer's Stone, Chamber of Secrets, Prisoner of Azkaban, and Goblet of Fire. Almost all of the game takes place inside Hogwarts. The gameplay is traditional action fare but not exactly the LEGO title you've probably played before. Most of the game's advancement is through fetch quests, mild combat, puzzle solving, and of course, the endless collecting of LEGO bits known as studs.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "June 29, 2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "TT Fusion", "publishers": "Warner Bros.
