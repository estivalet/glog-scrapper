Once Uncle Bob has recognized your talent, all paths are open to you. My Riding Stables: Life with Horses: The Riding Stables at the old mill needs a little polishing: The riding hall is run down, there\u2019s a draught in the stable and nobody wants to live in this shabby guesthouse. The player has to take over and push this place to new glory. The stable, the riding hall, and the guesthouse are renovated and soon guests are willing to pay for their stay, again. The player uses this money to build a new breeding stable and shortly after foals are frolicking there with their mothers. Later on the player starts training foals on the lunge and may sells them to trustworthy clients.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "November 6, 2013", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Independent Arts", "publishers": "TREVA Entertainment", "genres": "Life Simulation", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/130253-2-in-1-my-riding-stables-my-western-horse\n"}
