The Ogre", "overview": "Coach Hibiki gathers Japan's greatest football players from all over Japan (many of these players are featured in the first 2 seasons). The team (below) is mainly made up of players from Raimon/The Ultimate Eleven and Aliea Academy, however there is the inclusion of Sakuma from Teikoku Academy and Hijikata. There are also two newcomers to this game which are Utsunomiya Tormaru and Tobitaka Seiya. The players divide into 2 teams. One led by Endou and the other by Kidou. At the end of the game (In the anime) Endou's team wins by 3-2, including goals from Hiroto, Gouenji, Someoka, Reize and Fubuki. However, many of Kidou's team managed to make the team anyway, including Fudou, Gouenji, Tachimukai and Kidou himself. When the practice match is over Inazuma Japan's new coach is revealed to be Kudou Michiya and his daughter Fuyuka decides to become a manager for Inazuma Japan. Later the draw for the Asia preliminary matches is done, revealing that Japan had drawn against one of the favorites: Australia's team, Big Waves. With 2 days until the game with Australia, coach Kudou refuses to allow the team to practice and they must stay inside all day! However Tsunami manages to escape and perfects a new hissatsu technique \"The Typhoon\" which he uses to score past Australia. But the rest of the players had to resort to practicing in their rooms. We discover that this is what coach Kudou had wished for the team to do in order to beat Australia's Box-Lock Defence, this allowed them to beat this by practicing in such a tight confined space such as a room, for them to be able to keep close control of the ball, the player to realize this first is Kidou. This game finished 2-1 to Japan thanks to Gouenji's newly discovered hissatsu technique \"Bakunetsu Screw\". This game was later (three years) released in the West as Digital Download for the Nintendo 3DS.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "December 16, 2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Level 5", "publishers": "Level 5", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.6", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/129096-inazuma-eleven-3-sekai-e-no-chousen-the-ogre\n"}
