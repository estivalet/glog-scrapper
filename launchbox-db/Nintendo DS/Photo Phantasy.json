{"altername_name": ["Photo Phantasy: Spot the Differences"], "name": "Photo Phantasy", "overview": "A spot-the-image game, using the DS's twin screens. Hold the DS on it's side, and the left and right sides display a slightly different image. Use the stylus to note the differences. There are two sets of powerups: hourglasses, which completely refresh your time needed for the level, and magnifying glasses, which automatically find one difference for you. Each story begins with a certain number of these powerups, with no way to replenish them.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "February 1, 2011", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "7 Raven Studios", "publishers": "Zoo Publishing", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/99980-photo-phantasy\n"}
