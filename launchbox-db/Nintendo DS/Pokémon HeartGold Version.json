Set in the region of Johto, the player controls a new Pok\u00e9mon Trainer on his/her way to meet up with Pok\u00e9mon Researcher Professor Elm at his lab to receive his/her first Pok\u00e9mon. While running an errand for Elm, the player returns to find that a thief has stolen one of the professor's Pok\u00e9mon. This event starts your quest to becoming a Pok\u00e9mon master, leading you through the region of Johto and later Kanto, to battle the mysterious Team Rocket and capture all 493 Pok\u00e9mon. Along with retaining most of the original game's features, HeartGold contains quite a few new updates. Like Gold the story will incorporate the legendary Pok\u00e9mon Ho-Oh (who can be seen on the game's box art), although this time in a bigger fashion. Graphics have been upgraded to 3D models to resemble the series previous Nintendo DS iterations, Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum. The ability to have any one of your Pok\u00e9mon following you on the Overworld Screen which was limitedly seen in Pok\u00e9mon Yellow has been added. Included with the game is a peripheral known as the Pok\u00e9walker. Acting as a pedometer, the Pok\u00e9walker allows you to wirelessly transfer a Pok\u00e9mon from HeartGold to it. When there is a Pok\u00e9mon in the Pok\u00e9walker it gains \"experience points\" for each step you take. The player also earns a form of money known as \"watts\", which is used to help catch other Pok\u00e9mon and buy items. The game is compatible with the following games via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection: Pok\u00e9mon SoulSilver, Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "September 12, 2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Game Freak", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.39", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_HeartGold_and_SoulSilver", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3zpC6Zfqh8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2246-pokemon-heartgold-version\n"}
