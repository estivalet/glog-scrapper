{"altername_name": [], "name": "My Australian Farm", "overview": "My Australian Farm is a breeding simulation game! At the beginning, all you own is an empty field, a little money and a single emu. You need to feed the emu and take care of it! Well-fed with seed, it will lay eggs which can then be sold - with this money you can buy new animals at the Farmers\u2019 Market and purchase equipment from the Shopkeeper. Little by little as your farm builds up, you will unlock certain bonuses (a grain store, a wind turbine, a sacred stone, etc) and you will be able to exchange your animals with friends who play My Farm, My Exotic Farm, My Asian Farm or My Australian Farm!", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "July 28, 2011", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "BiP Media", "publishers": "BiP media", "genres": "Life Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/160083-my-australian-farm\n"}
