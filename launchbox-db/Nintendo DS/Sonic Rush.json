{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sonic Rush", "overview": "Double the screens...double the excitement! Sonic the Hedgehog has a new partner, Blaze the Cat, in this new entry for the series, Sonic Rush. You can play as either Sonic or Blaze as you try to track down the powerful Chaos and Sol emeralds, and face a new arch-nemesis that threatens the world. Sonic Rush displays intense and fast-paced platforming over both screens, allowing for screen-spanning long steep dives across both top and bottom screens, super high jumps, huge loops and more! Prepare for a whole new dual screen experience, Sonic-style!", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "November 15, 2005", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Dimps", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.89", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_Rush", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsZFnkP09gQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6587-sonic-rush\n"}
