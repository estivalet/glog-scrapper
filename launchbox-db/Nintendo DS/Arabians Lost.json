However, nearing her birthday, the King and Queen decided that she should marry and chose a husband for her. Wanting to live a normal life (which includes having a normal romance, falling in love, etc.), Aileen refused. This lead to a wager between Aileen and her parents; if Aileen could raise 10,000,000G in twenty five days, she's free to do what she wanted. If she failed, then she'd have to do what her parents had planned.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "September 10, 2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Quinrose", "publishers": "Prototype", "genres": "Visual Novel", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/131054-arabians-lost\n"}
