{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dragon Master", "overview": "The land of Alradur has become barren and few can remember a time when the fields blosomed with life. Yet legends persist of a thriving time when land and sky were alive, and man and dragons shared the world in harmony. Legends also tell of the dragons treachery; of how they destroyed the Tree of Life, casting all of Alradur into its sullen state. But there is still hope. In a forgotten passage, it's pages scattered throughout the land, there is a prophecy of boy and a dragon who will reunite the races, revive the Tree of Life, and bring back the order of the Dragon Masters, mightiest of Alradur's heroes. Are you up to the task?", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Rainfire Entertainment", "publishers": "Tivola Publishing", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/129879-dragon-master\n"}
