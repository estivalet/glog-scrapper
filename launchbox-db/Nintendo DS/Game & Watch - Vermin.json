{"altername_name": [], "name": "Game & Watch: Vermin", "overview": "Experience a piece of Nintendo history with the Game & Watch series for Nintendo DSiWare. Each title is a perfect recreation of a classic LCD game from the early 1980s, including normal Game A and alternate Game B modes. And no Game & Watch title would be complete without the \u2018Watch\u2019 function - each title includes a fully functional clock. In Vermin, take control of a gardener, protecting his plot from marauding moles. As the moles make their way towards you, move left and right to line yourself up to make a well-timed whack with your mallets and send the burrowers packing. In Game B, more moles will appear, making your life all the more harder!", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "July 15, 2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Nintendo", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Game_%26_Watch_games#Vermin", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/159910-game-watch-vermin\n"}
