In Link \u2018n\u2019 Launch, you must propel a rocket into space by flipping and rotating tiles to link fuel to the rocket\u2019s engines. In Mission Mode, you have just three minutes to reach the next planet, quickly linking tiles while keeping your rocket on course. Think your way around unmovable tiles and collect special tiles that upgrade your rocket or grant additional time. In Puzzle Mode, work out a path that will use up all the fuel and pipe tiles and clear the screen. With 100 puzzles to complete, it's a challenge of galactic proportions!", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "February 8, 2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Intelligent Systems", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/160070-link-n-launch\n"}
