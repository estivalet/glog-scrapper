{"altername_name": [], "name": "Legend of Kay", "overview": "Legend of Kay is a martial arts platformer starring Kay, a feisty young cat who has to save the world for all the peace-loving animals in the forest. The game sticks very close to the tried-and-true Zelda formula, with plenty of combat, platforming, puzzles, and minigames. And while it may have a couple of technical issues and lacks the scope and detail of a Zelda game, Kay's heart is in the right place, and it pulls off a great action adventure game for people of all ages.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "June 14, 2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Firehazard Studio", "publishers": "JoWooD Entertainment", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legend_of_Kay", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/74058-legend-of-kay\n"}
