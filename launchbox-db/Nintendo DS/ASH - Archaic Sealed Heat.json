However, this is not to last. For the moment the bracelet of Milinia touches Aisya's wrist a giant flaming serpent descended from the skies and set fire to the whole country. The green, prosperous Milinia and its majestic palace is no more, everything has fallen apart around Aisya when she finally came to her senses.
