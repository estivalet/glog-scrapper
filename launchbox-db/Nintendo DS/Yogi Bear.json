Players will be able to explore, jump, crawl, belly slide, sneak, and zip-line through majestic Jellystone Park locales in search of wildlife, adventure, and sometimes the distraction of a pic-a-nic basket or two! However, be careful, Ranger Smith doesn't tolerate disturbance of his campers and keeps a watchful eye over the park. Luckily there is Yogi Bear's trusty sidekick Boo Boo, to help Yogi get through difficult challenges and antics.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "December 7, 2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Monkey Bar Games", "publishers": "D3Publisher", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSn6rlZX6lY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/31713-yogi-bear\n"}
