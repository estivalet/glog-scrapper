The main appeal of this port is to create a story using effects, music, and visuals from its PS2 cousin and the movie. The Priestess Treasure Box (Miko-tebako) edition includes a black Nintendo DS Lite pouch, nine character stickers, and the limited edition instruction manual for newcomers to the series. Free story creation is limited to 1,000 pages (text bubbles) per person. While the protagonist is not seen in the game, the player can rename her to whatever they desire. Scenario creation has the following options available to players (from left to right in menu screen): A new page can be instantly created by pressing X. This can also be done in the Start menu. Players can delete a page, randomize the settings, title their production, and/or end their creation session. Quitting the creation process opens the prompt to save their sessions's progress. The scenario selection screen allows players to read, edit, copy, delete, or lock a scenario's availability for editing or sending. Fifteen unvoiced Ruby Party stories are initially available for the reader's enjoyment; these events have not been reproduced to another medium. None of these scenarios can be edited or erased by the player.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "November 30, 2006", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Koei", "publishers": "Koei", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/142034-pocket-scenario-series-harukanaru-toki-no-naka-de-mai-hitoyo\n"}
