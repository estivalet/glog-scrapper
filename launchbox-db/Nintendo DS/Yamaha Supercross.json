{"altername_name": [], "name": "Yamaha Supercross", "overview": "Yamaha Supercross for Nintendo DS is built around the same general design as the Wii and Windows versions but is made independently by another developer and differs in several ways. It lacks the challenge mode from the other version, but includes the other three game modes: championship, arcade and practice. The gameplay is largely the same, featuring three-dimensional graphics and a third-person viewpoint although the camera position is slightly more elevated. The race tracks are also similar but some differences in layout exist. There is one less bike included in this version compared to the Wii and Windows versions.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "April 7, 2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Aurona Technologies", "publishers": "Destination Software", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/80346-yamaha-supercross\n"}
