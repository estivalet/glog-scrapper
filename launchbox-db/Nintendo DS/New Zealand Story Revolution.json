{"altername_name": ["New Zealand Story DS"], "name": "New Zealand Story Revolution", "overview": "An accurate re-telling of the timeless 1988 original, New Zealand Story Revolution stars Tiki, a plucky Kiwi bird. The gameplay revolves around Tiki rescuing his kidnapped friends from the clutches of a treacherous leopard seal!! The setting for each of the game's levels remains untouched from the original though the environment's layouts have been remixed and re-jigged to provide fresh new challenges. Graphically, the game has undergone an overhaul that updates New Zealand Story's visuals while retaining the clean lines of its arcade ancestor.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "February 2, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Marvelous Entertainment", "publishers": "Ignition Entertainment", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.58", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/33992-new-zealand-story-revolution\n"}
