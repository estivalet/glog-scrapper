{"altername_name": [], "name": "Anata mo DS de Classic Kiite Mimasenka", "overview": "DS:Style is a series of educational software products for the Nintendo DS console. The motto for the series is \"The fun of games, the joy of learning\". Despite the motto and being sold for a game console, the products actually include almost no gaming elements, instead functioning as reference guides and knowledge quizzes. The series was perceived when it launched as an attempt by Square Enix to break into a new market, that of \"non-traditional gamers\". This game, translated \"Classical DS: Won't You Listen?\" is all about classical music. While mostly serving as a jukebox and encyclopedia for classical music, there's also a quiz that not only holds trivia questions but also asks you to name the tunes playing in the background.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "July 5, 2007", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Square Enix", "publishers": "Square Enix", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_DS:Style_products", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/101432-anata-mo-ds-de-classic-kiite-mimasenka\n"}
