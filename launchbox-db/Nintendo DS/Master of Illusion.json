This one is a take on magic, teaching the player but also performing magic tricks against the player itself. There are three different modes including Solo Magic, Magic Show and Magic Training. In Solo Magic, a magician performs parlor tricks such as guessing what card the player has just picked out or guessing by the hand gestures the player makes over the DS screen. In Magic Tricks, there are fourteen different tricks to try where the game is more of an assistant, helping the player out performing your tricks including having a friend pick out a card and drawing a face at the bottom of the screen that will guess the card picked out. It can also guess a person's birthday or where they are going on their vacation. Some of the tricks have the player recite different things through the microphone, for instance the vacation trick, or the player needs to blow into the microphone. The third mode is called Magic Training, which is more of a series of mini-games to help test reaction speed. There are step by step instructions of how to perform tricks and there is also a special deck of cards that comes with the game.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "November 26, 2007", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Nintendo", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Life Simulation", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6547-master-of-illusion\n"}
