{"altername_name": ["\u7ed8\u56fe\u65b9\u5757DS"], "name": "Picross DS", "overview": "Like finding the underlining 'picture' in a 'crossword puzzle', the goal in Picross DS is to fill a grid with squares and crosses in order to 'paint' a picture. Numbers at the head of the puzzles' columns and rows signify how the grids need to be filled out, but it will take a sharp mind to figure out the solution - and some speedy fingers to defeat the competition. The game's main Picross Mode offers a staggering 300 puzzles available to play at your leisure.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "January 25, 2007", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Jupiter", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.11", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picross_DS", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oOf0H1YHss", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/10966-picross-ds\n"}
