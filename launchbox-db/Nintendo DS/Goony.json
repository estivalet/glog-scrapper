{"altername_name": [], "name": "Goony", "overview": "Goony is a one-button arcade game for casual and core gamers. You control Goony, a jelly-like creature, who is running down a road covered in hazardous obstacles. The goal of the game is to stay alive for as long as possible. If you fall off the road or fall from a high place, you lose the game. Goony is constantly on the go, and moves either left or right. You can switch the direction by simply pressing the +Control Pad. Special blocks, which can help you, are scattered across the playfield. The playfield is infinitely long and lasts until you make a mistake. The number of steps you took is your final score.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "March 14, 2013", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Moragami Company", "publishers": "CIRCLE Entertainment", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/159923-goony\n"}
