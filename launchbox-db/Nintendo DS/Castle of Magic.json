{"altername_name": ["Chibi Shounen no Mahou Daibouken"], "name": "Castle of Magic", "overview": "Be prepared to face anything and everything as you try to save your friend from the clutches of the horrifying magician Nefastax in Castle Of Magic! To survive, you\u2019ll have to stand up to wild monsters whilst exploring environments that directly influence your movement. In this platform-based universe, the ground will make you stick, slide, sink, swim, levitate, and even walk on the ceiling when gravity disappears! As well as varied environments, giant bosses and beautiful environments, Castle Of Magic features innovative use of the Nintendo DSi Camera - allowing you to transform yourself into powerful new forms. Visit a Photo Cabin in the game and search for an object in real life that matches the colour of the character you want to transform into. Take a picture of a blue object with your Nintendo DSi Camera and abracadabra - you\u2019re transformed into a swordfish! The Nintendo DSi Camera also comes into play as you customise in-game items using pictures of your choice. Are you ready to dive into the unique world of Castle Of Magic?", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "November 23, 2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Gameloft", "publishers": "Gameloft", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_of_Magic", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/159636-castle-of-magic\n"}
