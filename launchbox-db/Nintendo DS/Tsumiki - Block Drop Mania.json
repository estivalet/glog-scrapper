{"altername_name": ["Tsunde Tsumikiss", "Tsumiki: The Infernal Tower", "\u5806\u79ef\u6728"], "name": "Tsumiki: Block Drop Mania", "overview": "Pile up blocks that fall from the sky until you reach the 'zone ceiling' target. Once a block touches the ground or another block, it will stick and the next block will start to fall. If a block comes to rest in a position that isn't well-balanced, it could topple off. You can grab hold of falling blocks using the stylus and slide them around or rotate them by manipulating their centers of gravity. The key to building a good stack is landing blocks in a stable, well-balanced position. Features \u2022 Stack piles of colorful shapes without dropping them. \u2022 Use realistic physics and gravity to keep the pieces from falling.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "October 21, 2011", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Nobilis", "publishers": "Southpeak Interactive", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/47697-tsumiki-block-drop-mania\n"}
