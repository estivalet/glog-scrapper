{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ultimate Spider-Man", "overview": "Like last year's game, Ultimate Spider-Man approaches the action in a very Viewtiful Joe-inspired design. The characters, objects, and environments all utilize the Nintendo DS system's 3D capabilities complete with a free-flowing, almost dynamic camera to follow the action. But the gameplay itself is strictly restricted to a 2D plane instead of the exploration heavy design of the upcoming console versions. But it's a decision that works for the unique nature of the Nintendo DS hardware. The Nintendo DS version is a completely unique experience, and what's more the development team have worked in some really great dual screen and touchscreen elements into the mix.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "September 22, 2005", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "Vicarious Visions", "publishers": "Activision", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.95", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21495-ultimate-spider-man\n"}
