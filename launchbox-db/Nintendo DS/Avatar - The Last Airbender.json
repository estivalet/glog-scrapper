{"altername_name": ["Avatar: The Legend of Aang", "Avatar: Der Herr der Elemente"], "name": "Avatar: The Last Airbender", "overview": "Based on the animated television program of the same name, Avatar: The Last Airbender follows the adventures of a group of kids living in an Asian-inspired fantasy world where the nations have been divided up according to the four classical elements: Air, Water, Earth, and Fire. Within each nation are people who can control that one element, known as benders. The Avatar is a person who can control all four elements, and is charged with keeping peace between the four nations. However, 100 years previous the Avatar had disappeared, making it possible for the Fire Nation to wage a war of conquest across the world. As the show begins, the new Avatar, Aang (originally an Airbender, hence the title of the series), has been found, and now he must travel the world, learning how to bend all four elements and fighting against the Fire Nation alongside his friends Katara (a Waterbender of the Water Tribe) and Sokka (her older brother).", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "October 10, 2006", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "THQ Studio Oz", "publishers": "THQ", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.9", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/8225-avatar-the-last-airbender\n"}
