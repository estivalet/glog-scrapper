{"altername_name": ["Tashiten: Tashite 10 ni Suru Monogatari", "De 10 en 10 - Una Aventura Matematica"], "name": "Make 10: A Journey of Numbers", "overview": "The player is taken to Make 10 Kingdom, a land ruled by Numbers, where they are requested by King Decimus to journey to meet with the 9 Make 10 Masters. Make 10 contains over 30 minigames, for which the rule is always to make multiples of 10: 10, 20, 30, and so on. That can be achieved in various ways by using the console's stylus: by covering up some numbers, switching numbers around, writing a number, etc. The minigames can be accessed through different modes: - Make 10 Kingdom, the story mode where the player journeys through Make 10 Kingdom, meeting the 9 Masters and unlocking minigames as they go. - Trial Mountains, where the player can test their skills at the minigames that have been unlocked - Make 10 Test, where the player can get their Make 10 skills evaluated. If stuck, the player can use Assist Points that are scattered all around the Kingdom.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "October 10, 2007", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "MuuMuu", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "7", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_10:_A_Journey_of_Numbers", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/102012-make-10-a-journey-of-numbers\n"}
