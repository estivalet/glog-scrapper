Climb the corporate ladder in the world of BOXLIFE using your wits and\u2026 paper? Use the Nintendo DSi Stylus to cut and then manipulate the paper into a box shape.

Success in each mode brings its own reward: clear ranks to be promoted and change your character\u2019s appearance and use your earnings to acquire new items for your character\u2019s miniature garden. With its stylish graphics and catchy sound, you may just find that thinking inside the box isn\u2019t such a bad thing sometimes!Games in the Art Style series feature elegant design, polished graphics, and pick-up-and-play controls, creating an experience focused purely on fun and engaging game play.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "June 22, 2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Skip", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.88", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxlife", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/30142-art-style-boxlife\n"}
