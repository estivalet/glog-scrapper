He is tasked by Commander Ikari to take care of the pilot Ayanami Rei. The gameplay consists of taking decisions upon Rei\u2019s weekly schedule, such as when she should attend classes, perform her duties as a NERV pilot, or simply go out and have fun. Graphically, the whole game is viewed from a first person perspective, with transitions between different scenarios, just like in visual novels. Sound-wise, music from the series is used. The game spawns over the period of one year, and takes place during the events of the main series, while also encompassing the movie The End of Evangelion.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "August 27, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Broccoli", "publishers": "Gainax", "genres": "Life Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.17", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion:_Ayanami_Raising_Project", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/51393-neon-genesis-evangelion-ayanami-raising-project\n"}
