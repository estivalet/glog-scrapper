{"altername_name": ["Trailblaze: Puzzle Incinerator", "Moyasu Puzzle: Flametail"], "name": "Flametail", "overview": "Blaze a path across the galaxy in this unique puzzle game. Holding the Nintendo DSi vertically, you must plot a route for your Flametail pod, using its red hot exhaust trail to burn through obstacles on your way to the next planet. Manoeuvre around a maze of blocks to burn them away as your pod passes by to clear the stage. Fortunately, there are plentiful power-ups and items such as the Bomb to blast a wide radius, or Radar which grants you a map to aid your route. In the main Space Tour mode, journey from Earth into outer space on a block-burning and brain-busting voyage. Or set yourself a challenge against the clock in Time Limit mode. Plus \u2013 if you achieve a high score, you can even take a photo of yourself with the inner camera of the Nintendo DSi system and show off your winning smile!", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "January 27, 2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Mindware", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/160156-flametail\n"}
