{"altername_name": ["KuruKuru Action: KuruPachi 6"], "name": "Spin Six", "overview": "Spin Six is a puzzle game guaranteed to bring a new twist to the genre. It\u2019s all about rotating number panels to make horizontal or vertical lines of the same number to clear them from the board. While that sounds simple, the challenge lies in your ability to make chains of number panels to score even bigger points. There are four unique game modes, each with various skill levels. Puzzle mode brings you nearly 200 puzzles, split into One-Turn or Chain categories, or you can challenge your panel elimination skills in Time Attack mode. Pit yourself against a time limit in Score Attack mode (use the Spinnerator to get into Fever Time and really boost your score!), while Chain Challenge is about making as many chains as you can in one go. With easy to master, but deep gameplay, it\u2019s about time you gave Spin Six a whirl!", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "June 21, 2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Zener Works", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/160127-spin-six\n"}
