{"altername_name": [], "name": "Fighting Fantasy: The Warlock of Firetop Mountain", "overview": "Fighting Fantasy: The Warlock of Firetop Mountain follows a lone adventurer on his travels through the old Dwarven keep within Firetop Mountain. Now the residence of an evil warlock and hordes of foul creatures, the keep is a mysterious and dangerous place from which no one has returned in many years. As players guide the adventurer through the many passageways and dungeons, they develop the character's abilities and attributes to suit their play style. Enemies will fall before the player's brute strength with sword and axe, power of the arcane arts, nimble quickness or custom combinations of skills. A wealth of weaponry, armor, potions and enchantments are equipped through an intuitive drag-and-drop inventory system while helpful (or not-so-helpful) NPCs provide guidance, quests, trade goods and skill training.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "November 23, 2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Big Blue Bubble", "publishers": "Aspyr Media", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.55", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighting_Fantasy:_The_Warlock_of_Firetop_Mountain", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZRjcQwQrU0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/14672-fighting-fantasy-the-warlock-of-firetop-mountain\n"}
