The game starts out when Shawn loans his brother's Nintendo DS to a boy named Miguel. Shortly after, Miguel's father hurriedly pulls up in a limo and tells Miguel to hop in, leaving Shawn DS-less as the car speeds away with the police in hot pursuit. Now with the help of his Aunt Gina and other odd characters, Shawn is on a quest to Mexico to retrieve the game system and learn basic Spanish. The game consists of three minigames: Hangman, a word search, and a card-flipping memory game.
