{"altername_name": ["Need for Speed Carbono: Domina la Ciudad"], "name": "Need for Speed Carbon: Own the City", "overview": "The Nintendo DS receives its version of Need for Speed: Carbon with Own the City, a The Fast and the Furious-themed arcade racer in which you take the role of a novice street racer out to avenge the seemingly accidental death of your older brother. With the aid of his ex-girlfriend and a few friends you'll have to take on all the racing crews of the city to get your answers, who'll only answer to you once you beat them in racing duels. Winning also allows you to cash in points for new cars, upgrades and racing kits, which become essential for getting the edge over the competition. You can race alone with the aid of your NPC wingmen and uncover the plot behind your brother's murder or race vs multiple opponents via Nintendo Wifi to see who's king of the streets in a variety of racing modes.", "platform": "Nintendo DS", "release_date": "October 31, 2006", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Electronic Arts Canada", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.24", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Need_for_Speed:_Carbon#Need_for_Speed:_Carbon_%E2%80%93_Own_the_City", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/85451-need-for-speed-carbon-own-the-city\n"}
