{"name": "Burn 'Out", "overview": "Burn 'Out is an arcade-style racing game where you drive a small buggy around a twisting, torturously undulating log track.<br>To complete Burn Out you have to take part in a series of races, coming first, second or third in each race and finishing inside a time limit.<br>You can start at either the first track or one of two later tracks - supposedly harder to start from, the idea being that if you start from the first track you can upgrade your car from the in-between level shop to the point where the harder levels are actually considerably easier by the time you reach them. You get money to buy upgrades with by winning races - the better you do the more money you get.", "platform": "Acorn Archimedes", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Oregan Software Developments", "publishers": "Oregan Software Developments", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/79768"}
