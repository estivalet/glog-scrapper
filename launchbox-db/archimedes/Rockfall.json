{"name": "Rockfall", "overview": "Rockfall is a Boulder Dash variant. It is not related to the Atari ST series with the same name more than being inspired by the same game. Like in the original game the objective is to collect a certain number of gems in each of the game's levels. At the same time falling boulders have to be avoided since being hit by one leads to a loss of life. There are also some creatures moving around the caves that the player can kill by letting boulders or gems fall on them. Some of them will then be turned into gems. There are also bombs that can be collected and used to kill the creatures. Once enough gems have been collected an exit will open that the player can escape through. This all has to be done before the timer reaches zero.", "platform": "Acorn Archimedes", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Software Evolutions", "publishers": "Eterna", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/80410"}
