The aim of the game is to move through the labyrinths of the monastery, collect treasures and use golden keys to unlock the Doors of Destiny. On each floor three goblets need to be collected.<br><br>The monk is controlled from a side view which looks similar to a platform game but there is no jumping since the monk can levitate through the air. The monastery is full of strange objects that zaps the monk's energy when touched but these can be destroyed by throwing bombs. These bombs can be thrown through walls and at specific places it is also possible to walk through walls. Energy also decreases automatically with time and when throwing bombs which means the player can't take too long since a life is lost when energy runs out.", "platform": "Acorn Archimedes", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Steve Minifie", "publishers": "Minerva", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.88", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/80489"}
