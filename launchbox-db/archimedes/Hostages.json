{"name": "Hostages", "overview": "Terrorists have overrun an embassy and hold the people inside as hostages. You control six counter-terrorists whose mission is to eliminate the terrorists. In the first part of the game, you have to bring three men into position so they can snipe the building. The second part involves entering the building with the other three men to kill the terrorists and rescue the hostages. Depending on how well you positioned your snipers, you can use them to assist you on that mission.", "platform": "Acorn Archimedes", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Obscure Designs", "publishers": "Superior Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hadyCMsNqwY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/122743"}
