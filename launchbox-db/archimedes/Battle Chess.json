{"name": "Battle Chess", "overview": "Battle Chess is a quite typical chess game, but it comes with a twist: all pieces are represented by small, realistic figures that walk around on the chessboard, and when one piece takes another, they both take part in an animated battle. There is a different animation for each permutation, depending on which pieces are capturing or being captured. You can also play in 2D without animation.<br><br>The game's opening library includes 30,000 different moves, ensuring a variety of games will unfold across the 10 skill levels.", "platform": "Acorn Archimedes", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Krisalis Software", "publishers": "Krisalis Software", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.07", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75053"}
