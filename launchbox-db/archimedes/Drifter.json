{"name": "Drifter", "overview": "Drifter is a racing game in the style of console games like Wipeout, in which you control a craft with jet engines and no actual contact with the ground.<br>A number of different craft are included as well as the \"Hyper\" bonus craft, which travels much faster than any of the standard ones, and the \"Exocet\", which has an extremely useful self-repair feature. The computer drivers swerve to avoid you but they also make mistakes (crashing into walls and bridges), and can be quite aggressive (towards each other, as well as the player) when a suitable opportunity presents itself.<br>Tracks are grouped into pairs, and when you can come first or second in both of a pair you are allowed to move onto the next two tracks.", "platform": "Acorn Archimedes", "release_date": "1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Andrew Docking", "publishers": "The Fourth Dimension", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/79795"}
