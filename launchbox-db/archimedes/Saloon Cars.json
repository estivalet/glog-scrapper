{"name": "Saloon Cars", "overview": "Saloon Cars gives you the chance to take part in a touring cars championship. Upon loading you are presented with the main menu. From here you can watch the demo mode, set up the controls for the game, select a course and load or save a new player file. Then there is the race option which leads to the game itself. You can practice a track with or without other cars and then the actual race itself. Once you have qualified on the grid then the race can begin.<br><br>The tracks you race around are real racing tracks, so Silverstone, and Brands Hatch are included, although since this game was released the real circuit layouts have changed. The pit lane also features in this game, as you can come in for pit stops and have your car worked on if there are any problems with it.<br><br>When you start a race you can choose which car to race in subject to the amount of money you have, and the more races you win the more money you will have to upgrade to a better car. Whichever car you buy you have the option of having either automatic or manual gearboxes, plus the option of having large wheel arches and front or rear wheel drive. You can also upgrade your car throughout races with more powerful engines and better tyres.<br><br>As an added bonus the original Saloon Cars Extra Tracks release is included which includes Oulton Park, Donnington circuits and a made up Seaside track.", "platform": "Acorn Archimedes", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "The Fourth Dimension", "publishers": "The Fourth Dimension", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/80412"}
