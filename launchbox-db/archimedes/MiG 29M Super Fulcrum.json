{"name": "MiG 29M Super Fulcrum", "overview": "Taking off from where MiG-29 Fulcrum left off, Simis created a new simulator based around the top-modern MiG-29M. The M model has been equipped with modernised avionics, a fly-by-wire system and stronger engines.<br><br>As opposed to its predecessor, Super Fulcrum takes place in one big scenario instead of single missions. Your task is to represent the Soviet Union in a UN force sent to South America to defend a small country that is being threatened by a bigger and stronger neighbour. The game is relatively open-ended, allowing you to fulfill your missions in the way you see fit instead of monitoring your every step. All missions and their results are handled in your pilot's log.", "platform": "Acorn Archimedes", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Simis", "publishers": "Domark Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/81608"}
