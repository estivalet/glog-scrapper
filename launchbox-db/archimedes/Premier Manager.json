You have an overdraft available, but make sure not to exceed it.<br>The game supports up to 4 players, whose matches all take place at the same time. You can make tactical changes and substitutions mid-match.", "platform": "Acorn Archimedes", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Realms of Fantasy", "publishers": "Gremlin Graphics Software", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/80099"}
