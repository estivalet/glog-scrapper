{"name": "Wonderland", "overview": "Wonderland is a text adventure with graphics, based on Lewis Carroll's classic novel Alice in Wonderland. The game follows the book's general story, while adding many descriptions, locations and puzzles of its own. The interaction with the environment is done mostly by typing; however, commands may also appear in pop-up menus and can be selected by the player. Sometimes puzzles need to be solved in order to be able to advance. The game features windows with adjustable size, separating graphical display from inventory, command interface, text descriptions, and other options.", "platform": "Acorn Archimedes", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "magnetic Scrolls", "publishers": "Virgin Mastertronic", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/80501"}
