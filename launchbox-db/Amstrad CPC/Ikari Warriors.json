According to designer Keiko Iju, the game was inspired by the popular Rambo films and takes its name from the Japanese title of Rambo: First Blood Part II (Rambo: Ikari no Dasshutsu or \"The Furious Escape\"). Ralf and Clark also make an appearance as playable characters in Metal Slug 6 and Metal Slug 7, as well as the King of Fighters series.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "January 1, 1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "SNK Corporation", "publishers": "Elite Systems Ltd.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFSXIy2_71I", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/28398"}
