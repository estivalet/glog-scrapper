{"name": "Skateball", "overview": "Skateball is a futuristic sports game in which two teams try to score goals by putting a puck into the opponent's goal. Just like ice hockey, the team members skate on ice and use a hockey stick. However, the active team only consists of two members: a field athlete and a goalkeeper. The player controls the field athlete and tries to score goals or tackling the enemy when in defense.<br><br>As with many futuristic sports games, a match can be hazardous to the athletes. Not only are rude actions like flying kicks allowed, but the playing field is filled with obstacles like pits or disintegrators. Stepping on those causes the athlete to die and the need to use one of the two substitute athletes. Those have different stats (strength, reaction, shooting and balance) which influence the match - if there are enough alive, the player can choose the used athlete at the start of the match. The scrolling screen keeps on the puck and a radar helps to navigate the obstacles off-screen.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ubi Soft", "publishers": "Ubi Soft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109454"}
