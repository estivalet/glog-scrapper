{"name": "Rollaball ", "overview": "The objective of Rolaball is simple: Move your ball on the isometric landscape guarded by baddies, pick up the crosses and go for the exit. After you clear the first few levels, the game becomes more involved, with each level having several exits, some of which teleport you between different platforms without any natural collection. Though this might look and sound like Marble Madness, that is not the case, since the ball is moved in steps between tiles and without any inertia.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Timeslip Software", "publishers": "Strategy Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109418"}
