There are a total of 40 levels of increasing difficulty, with each wave of enemies being more deadly and numerous. The starting wave has 4 passive enemies, and walls of energy that suddenly appear and annihilate your ship on contact. Later enemies also shoot back.<br><br>Bonus points are given for the time remaining at the end of the level, as well as collecting tumbling satellites that appear throughout the game.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ian Beynon", "publishers": "Amsoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YL80jKFIM2A", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/74802"}
