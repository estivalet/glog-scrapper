{"name": "Spindrone", "overview": "THE author of Spindrone seems to have discovered the solution to a problem that has bugged governments for years - the way to get rid of plutonium. You simply leave it outside in neat rows and let some aliens take it away.<br>The setting is the planet Fungii 7, where the only native lifeform is a type of toadstool. As you may know, to colonise a planet you need plutonium, and as you have just colonised Fungii 7 you have tonnes of the stuff lying around in large baked bean tins. Leaving all this nuclear fuel in nice rows is just too much of a temptation to the unfriendly neighbourhood aliens, who have decided to relieve you of it.<br>Although the CND supporters among the colonists might be pleased, your bosses aren't. They have given you the task of convining the nasty Kermatoid aliens that stealing is morally wrong, using the tried and trusted technique of blowing them up. The plot makes all the difference in games like these, doesn't it?", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Atlantis Software", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109548"}
