It is your job to destroy them, skimming the planet's surface and blasting them out. Forbidden Planet is viewed form the cockpit of your craft, with the action displayed in vector graphics. You must shoot out Anti-Aircraft towers and guided missiles for points, while avoiding the damage they can inflict. As well as controls, options include limiting some of the sound effects, and arranging the in-game display in 3 different ways.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Design Design", "publishers": "Design Design", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/108950"}
