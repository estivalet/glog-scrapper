{"name": "Groops", "overview": "TILE MATCHING CAN BE FUN<br><br>here's a distinctly Tetris drift to this riveting puzzler, but with one major difference: all of the blocks are given to you right at the start.<br><br>With Groops, the aim is to attain the biggest score you can. You do this by identifying any matching tiles in groups of more than two before blowing them up. This leaves a gap, into which the tiles above will fall and sometimes this results in another group of more than two matching tiles.<br>The player simply goes through the board until either the screen is cleared - a difficult task, for sure - or you end up with tots of individual blocks which cannot be paired up and evaporated.<br><br>At first, the game is rather dull, but the more you play, the more you realise the extent of the challenge. You begin to plan ahead, working out the effect of the moves you make on the overall game. And with big points to be had for blowing up large groups of matching tiles, there's always something to strive for.<br><br>The beauty of the presentation in this colourful game is worth pointing out. But it's the modes of play which are most important, with a choice of normal, fast (giving you half the number of tiles but making scoring more difficult) and challenge (presenting you with one of 16 screens that are accessed when you achieve a particular score) to keep you hooked.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "2007", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "BINARY SCIENCES", "publishers": "", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/152891"}
