{"name": "Knight Games", "overview": "Knight Games consists of eight self-contained small games with a medieval theme. Two are shooting games. The Crossbow event involves moving a crosshair so as to hit one of an array of rotating targets. Once you've mastered this you are ready for Archery - this time you must hit targets which move from left to right, so timing is more important.<br><br>The other six involve one-on-one combat. There are two sword-fighting battles against different backdrops; in each of them you must make 10 hits to get your opponent down, and do that 10 times to win overall. Time your jabs and shields to achieve this.<br><br>The other four events follow the same formula, but with slightly different weapons. The Quartermast event is on a log, although the action is still only 2-dimensional. Ball & Chain, Axe and Pike battles complete the set. All can be played by 2 human players.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "English Software", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "0.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/28750"}
