{"name": "Best of the Best: Championship Karate", "overview": "Best of the Best Championship Karate is a realistic fighting game. After you choose your fighter for his parameters (strength, stamina and resistance), you can choose from 55 different moves. You can now train your fighter at a gym before the real fights. To master the game, one must alternate training and fights, as training improves stamina, strength and resistance. Be careful, losing a fight reduces those parameters, so you have to be ready before getting in the ring!", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Futura", "publishers": "Loriciels", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75310"}
