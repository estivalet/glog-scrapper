{"name": "Fighting Warrior", "overview": "A Pharaoh has captured a Princess and imprisoned her in a temple, and it is your job to fight through perilous lands to get her back. This takes place in a side-view beat 'em up similar to Way of the Exploding Fist. Mythical winged and dog-headed monsters and half-human hybrids are your opponents, fought one at a time. You can duck and jump, and the weapon at your disposal can be used for high, middle and low strikes. Containers offering magical powers (both good and bad) can be found and unlocked. Once inside the temple there are more foes to defeat.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Studio B", "publishers": "Melbourne House", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/108935"}
