{"name": "Afteroids", "overview": "Take one of the earliest computer games ever (namely Asteroids), and add some nice graphics to it, along with a few bonuses to pick up. That's what you've got here. You control a little spaceship that floats around a large arena, and you have to blast all the meteors and other objects that bounce about the arena. However, shooting meteors will cause them to fragment into several smaller meteors. Another problem is that there's no friction and controlling your spaceship is difficult, to say the least.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Carlos Granados", "publishers": "Zigurat", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-RPY3xC8LI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/74758"}
