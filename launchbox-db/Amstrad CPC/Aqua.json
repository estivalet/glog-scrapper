{"name": "Aqua", "overview": "The story of this game is original; a bubble begins its quest from the bottom of the ocean, and you need to guide it through the dangers of deep water to the liberty of the surface! The controls are rather simple and easy to learn. You should try not to touch the surrounding rocks and sea creatures because the bubble will lose energy. The graphics are cute and colourful and happy tunes that remind us of old songs play during the game, although you can also turn them off. The grab factor is high. The quest of the bubble and the adventures you can experience through it can make you want to try again and again to succeed in reaching the surface", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "2006", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "CEZ Games Studio", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA0LhdnbjGg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/77417"}
