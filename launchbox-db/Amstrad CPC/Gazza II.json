{"name": "Gazza II", "overview": "In the game inspired by legendary English footballer Paul 'Gazza' Gascoigne, you play matches with your favourite international team.. Moving in eight directions on a side-scrolling pitch, you also can control the power of your kick. Teams you choose are different in difficulty - Brazil is more powerful team then Albania. But you can't play in Premier League or a knockout championship. Two human players can play against each other, although only one can use a joystick on some versions.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Paul Clansey", "publishers": "Empire Software", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMzAHR2JLmo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/85889"}
