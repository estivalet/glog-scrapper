{"name": "Spy vs Spy II: The Island Caper", "overview": "A follow-up to the first Spy vs Spy game now sees the spies stranded on a desert island. This time, instead of the four items which allow you to leave for the airport, the spies must try to collect three pieces of a missile and escape from the island in a waiting submarine before a volcano erupts. There are a few pitfalls to avoid such as quicksand and sharks. There are also new traps (hidden pits, napalm, snares and a pistol) and hand-to-hand combat is done with swords instead of clubs.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Orpheus", "publishers": "Databyte", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109556"}
