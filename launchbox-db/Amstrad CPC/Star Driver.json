{"name": "Star Driver", "overview": "Asteroids exploited to the last gram of their mineral resources and finally abandoned are used to organize races against the clock on winding roads. Enjoyable alone or with a friend, STAR DRIVER offers original direction for a well-proven style of game.<br><br>A clever coding routine offers a striking view with curved perspective that justify the idea of racing around an asteroid. On the other hand, the graphics lack of details and the sound of your engine is atrocious. Controlling the car is difficult and you have to be persevering but once you understood how it works, you should progress quickly. When you have completed the first lap imposed in less than 60 seconds on each asteroid, taking care not to hit the stage, you can try the \"double-orbit\" that consists to accomplish a second laps in a total time of less than 100 seconds. In \"versus\" mode, the fastest player wins. Despite the small size of the playing area and once overcome frustration of the first attempts, we pass a funny time in front of the CPC screen.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Shockerzoft", "publishers": "Radical Software", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2hKl7WOW-8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/127252"}
