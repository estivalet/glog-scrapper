{"name": "Slug", "overview": "Picture the scene. It's Friday night, 11PM. Slug and his sweetheart are settling down in front of the gogglebox to watch the Friday Nite Horror Movie, 'Emperor Hades Meets the Yak Faced Melboids from East London Part 37 (Revisited) when from out of nowhere, a huge mechanical hand reaches down and plucks your beloved from before your very eyes. Bewilderment quickly turns to determination as you vow, whatever the cost, to save her. You discover that she has been taken to a strange land where monstrous creatures roam. (No, not Glasgow, silly!) These creatures include snails, turtles, snakes, blobs on legs and sheep on springs (Hiya Jeff!) Your test then is to collect the hearts that will guarantee your girlfriend's release. The number needed to complete each screen varies with the level you are on. You must also be on the lookout for bombs. These count down from 9 to 0 before exploding, but you can defuse them simply by running into them. You may thing that all of this is too much for a lowly slug to handle, but you are armed with T.N.T.S. (Tri-Nitro-Toluene Slime!!) which will destroy the creatures on contact. So there you have it, your quest awaits.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/129956"}
