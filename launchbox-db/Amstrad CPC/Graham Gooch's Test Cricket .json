{"name": "Graham Gooch's Test Cricket ", "overview": "Time to get your bat and pads, put on the whites and have a game of cricket. In this computer version of the game, you have the choice of length of game (40, 50, 60 overs or two innings), how many players (one or two), skill level (one to nine) and whether you want to play a simulation or arcade version. You then choose your eleven players for each team: wicket-keepers, slip catchers and bowlers.<br><br>The main game is viewed showing a small part of the field from behind the bowler at an elevated angle. Also shown: the batters, wicket-keeper and slip catcher. In simulation mode you control the direction of the ball when bowling. In arcade you can determine the speed as well. For the batter, in simulation mode you can play defensively or aggressively. In arcade mode you always play aggressively. If a ball is hit into the field then it shows a side view at an elevated angle of the fielders chasing the ball. The computer determines how many runs you get.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Graham Blighe", "publishers": "Audiogenic Software Ltd.", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/108995"}
