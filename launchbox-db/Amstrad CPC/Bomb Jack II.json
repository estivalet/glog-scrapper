{"name": "Bomb Jack II", "overview": "Having saved the world in the first game, Bomb Jack is out to collect as much gold as possible, which is lying on a number of ledges. These vary between open and shut - the open ones offer more points, and an extra life is on offer for collecting 10 in a row, so if possible the route should take in the open ones in order.<br><br>Gameplay differs from the original, in that Bombjack's movement is no longer free and self-propelled. Instead, he moves flick-style between ledges, so long as one is directly within one of the 4 compass directions. Baddies can be pushed off ledges, but this uses up some of Jack's limited energy.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Elite Systems", "publishers": "Elite Systems", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.43", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx5p4zHYCZY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/28662"}
