{"name": "Smaily", "overview": "There is less than a year left before the Barcelona'92 Olympic Games begin. The city lives at an accelerated pace to be able to have everything ready on the big opening day. At the same time, a new international terrorist group called ANUTIL'S GROUP, aims to make itself known on the occasion of this worldwide event. His first action took place at the headquarters of the games and consisted of the spectacular theft of the Olympic Rings. It is a great catastrophe. This can endanger the good development of the competition. For the sake of the Olympics and Barcelona they must be recovered. The COOB'92 has decided to resort to the famous Professor Tenaki and his young assistant Osi Kabuto, who, thanks to the professor's latest invention and Osi's ability, will be the only ones capable of solving the problem. The mission is to recover the five Olympic Hoops before the deadline given by the terrorist organization. To do this you must enter the city of Barcelona, \u200b\u200bwhich is in the hands of the terrorists, and, helped by the numerous weapons that you will find in your path, fight with the enemies until you give, one by one, with the five rings. The weapons that you will find in your path will be very useful, so do not miss them. Some of them will last a short period of time and others a limited number of uses, so keep an eye on them and use them where necessary.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/129957"}
