{"name": "Ninja (Micro Mag)", "overview": "Another classic run'n gun in which you lead a character to the final battle against two successive bosses, one half way and the other at the end of the single level. The enemies invade the playing area, forcing you to move forward step by step launching tons of shurikens. Once again we plague against energy lost with enemies arising when we arrived in screen edge but we manage to progress with a little bit of perseverance.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "February 1, 1990", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "", "developers": "Black System", "publishers": "Micro Mag", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/127595"}
