{"name": "Fly Spy ", "overview": "Another one of those bizarre games! In this one, you must locate the brain within a maze and destroy it with a bomb. You control a little helicopter and you can pick up objects to use in certain sections of the maze. There's a lot of teleporting to be done and it's easy to get trapped, and you'll also need a pen and paper to note the codes for the teleport stations.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Richard Aplin", "publishers": "Mastertronic Ltd.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jq1ahdlv8U", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/108943"}
