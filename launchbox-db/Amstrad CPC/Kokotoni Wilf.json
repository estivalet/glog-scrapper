{"name": "Kokotoni Wilf", "overview": "Kokotoni Wilf has been sent on a bold journey through time, to recover the seven pieces of the Dragon Amulet. There are 63 screens across 6 times zones to trek through in order to find these star-like objects.<br><br>These screens are viewed from the side, and resemble Jet Set Willy, except that Wilf can fly through them and hover at a precision point. With hazards ranging from dinosaurs to spears to spaceships, and pieces located in hard-to-reach places, you will need this extra skill, especially as you have no weaponry. Most screens have more than 2 exits, but some are dead ends or lead directly into hazardous points. On each world you can immediately access the first 3 screens.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Elite Systems Ltd.", "publishers": "Elite Systems Ltd.", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/87530"}
