{"name": "Rigel's Revenge", "overview": "The Re-Unification War is in full swing throughout the 22nd Century Galaxy, during your career as reporter Harper. When you are sent to Rigel V, your partner Elliott is killed by a bomb, and attempts to communicate some instructions to you as he fades. You catch part of them, telling you to proceed eastwards, disarm a device protected by andriod guards, and find a light-guide. In this text adventure, you set about doing precisely those things. Solutions have a sense of realism - you have to dive to avoid bullets and use a mine detector. Objects include an Identicard, a Jetcycle and dipswitches. Input is mostly VERB NOUN, but a few commands require fine-tuning.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Bulldog", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109403"}
