{"name": "Miami Cobra GT", "overview": "Another racing game from Chevy Chase's Nigel Speight and it's another good one and way more fun than Out Run was supposed to be, in fact I'm willing to put this even ahead of Chevy Chase because of the view and the smaller car which makes it easier to maneuver your car. But both are really good racing games worth checking out. And you paid far less money for this and Chevy Chase compared to Out Run as well. This does what Out Run could", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nigel Speight", "publishers": "Players Software", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGWq8CJ75as", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/122381"}
