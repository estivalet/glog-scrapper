{"name": "Phantomas 2.0", "overview": "The android Phantomas is on a mission to destroy Count Dracula and rid the land of his malign influence. You must explore his castle and find the three items \u2013 a cross, a stake and a hammer \u2013 that must be used in order to slay him. You will also need to open 6 windows within the castle, to let sunlight enter and weaken the Count. Various other objects can also be collected, which will ultimately enable you to gain access to other areas of the castle. This is a remake of the Dinamic game Phantomas 2, which Code Masters also published as Vampire, and it's a worthy effort. It features music (which was lacking in the original game), much better and more colourful graphics, and a slightly different control method that makes jumping more intuitive. One thing that hasn't changed is that it's still just as difficult to complete as the original game!", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "2018", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Matra Computer Automations", "publishers": "", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/153166"}
