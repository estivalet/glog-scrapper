{"name": "Lop Ears", "overview": "Lop Ears, the rabbit went out playing, and exploring, on his own. Unfortunately, he strayed far from his normal territory and became lost. When he tried to find his way back home, he discovered that a by-pass had been completed across his route, barring his way home to his family, and friends.<br><br>You must help Lop Ears safely find his way home. You must carefully explore many different locations, including towns, gardens, woodland areas, and other rabbits' burrows. You will encounter many other animals including dogs, squirrels, birds, weasels, and other rabbits. Some of these will be your friend and help you; some will hinder you. You will need to solve puzzles, some simple, some complex, in order to get help from the other creatures that you meet. Also you must keep your energy up by eating carrots - but first you must find them!! Sometimes you may need to store them, whilst you solve another puzzle.<br><br>At first it may seem to be simple to guide Lop Ears home. But initial appearances can often be misleading, as you will soon discover. You will need all your logical powers, and lateral thinking to be successful, but if you are, Lop Ears' family will be so very happy to see him home safe and sound, and Oh! so very grateful to you!!", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Players Software", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/108662"}
