{"name": "Alcon 2020", "overview": "Take on the role of an Allied League of Cosmic Nations pilot in an SW464 fighter and take on the alien invaders of the planet Theron. Wait, this sounds familiar... It's Slap Fight! Originally released for the CPC in 1987, this faithful remake surfaces on the trusty CPC, boasting compatibility with all CPC machines thanks to its use of the X-MEM cartridge. It's incredibly faithful to the arcade original and the only thing more beautiful than the scrolling would be the music. Of course, you'll need to be pretty skilful to hear all the tunes. There's a tricky but fair learning curve to the game. The only fault is that the power-ups have been replaced with icons instead of words (like Nemesis) so it can be easy to choose the wrong power-up in the midst of battle, but other than that, it's a flawless and worthy remake.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "2020", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Abalore Games", "publishers": "", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/152887"}
