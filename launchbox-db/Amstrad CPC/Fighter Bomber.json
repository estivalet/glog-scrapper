In the end, the aircrew that has gained the post points receives the Curtis E. LeMay trophy.<br><br>In this game, you are the pilot of one of these aircrews with a choice of flying one of six aircraft, and your missions will pit you against any of seven additional enemy aircraft (although you will not get to fly them). To practice flying, you can do a Free Flight; when you're ready to compete, you will get to complete a series of 16 missions. You can also design your own missions, if you like.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Vektor Grafix", "publishers": "Activision", "genres": "Flight Simulator", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/85565"}
