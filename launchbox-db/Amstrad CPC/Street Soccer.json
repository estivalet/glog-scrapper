{"name": "Street Soccer", "overview": "Street Soccer is basically football without the rules, fouls go unpenalised and the pitch is more irregular with cars and buildings to get in the way. It was released as part of the Codemasters compilation 4 Soccer Simulators. If there are more than one players then you can have one of four combinations: player vs player, two players vs computer, two players vs one player and two vs two. The extra options add to the fun in the same way that a similar option in Matchday II did. There's also an option on the main menu for auto or manual. This allows either the computer to choose the player that's under computer control or you can select him manually by moving a pointer over him.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Supersonic Software", "publishers": "Codemasters", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/125021"}
