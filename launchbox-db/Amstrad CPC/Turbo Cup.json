{"name": "Turbo Cup", "overview": "Based on sportscar and Paris-Dakar racer Ren\u00e9 Metge and his Porsche 944 Turbo, Turbo Cup is a racing game viewed from above and behind the car, in a forced perspective. Instead of the sand of the Dakar race, the game features four conventional French racetracks - Paul Ricard, Nogaro, Magny-Cours and Dijon-Prenois.<br><br>After completing a qualifying lap you race against 21 similar cars. Contact with cars from behind causes you to spin but does not affect your rival, although side-on contact is usually beneficial. There are hazards off the track to avoid, and hitting the grass at speed causes a spin. Some early copies included a limited edition 1:20 model of the car, while later copies included a form allowing this to be bought.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Loriciels", "publishers": "Loriciels", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/108144"}
