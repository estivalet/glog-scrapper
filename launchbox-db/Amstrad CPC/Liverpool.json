{"name": "Liverpool", "overview": "The Amstrad CPC appears to be the only released version of Grandslam's original vision of a licensed Liverpool FC game (a Striker-style forced perspective 3D game surfaced for 16-bit systems in 1992, and a slightly simplified top-view version for C64 a year later). A human player must represent Liverpool, and can play either single 1 or 2 player matches or a full league. The second team always wears white. The English Division 1 teams of the time are included, with their 11 first-choice players named. Attendances are calculated, and goalscorers are recorded.<br><br>The action is viewed side-on, and uses a power bar to affect the strength of passes and shots - two bars move along the bottom of the screen in sequence, and must be stopped as close together as possible to produce a good contact with the ball. <br><br>The ball sticks to a player's foot. Players appear to occasionally freeze, and sometimes two players will get jammed together, and need a third to move the ball. The view is very close-up, but a scanner of the whole pitch is provided, as well as a running clock.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/108656"}
