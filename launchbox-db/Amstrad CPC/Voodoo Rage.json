{"name": "Voodoo Rage", "overview": "There are 20 screens to get through in sequence, and on each one you have to perform the familiar task of picking up all the objects on screen while avoiding the mutant creatures trying to stop you. The platforms on which all this takes place look different on each screen but behave in exactly the same way. Your character can walk on them, or freely jump through them to get up the screen.<br>The husband appears on a platform which also contains a video game console of some sort. He wanders randomly to and fro on the platform, and while he's doing that you can't touch him. However if he starts playing at the console and you've picked up a rolling pin you can go and beat him up for bonus points.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Remote", "publishers": "Arctic Computing", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/108637"}
