{"name": "Mobile Man", "overview": "As man in some sort of hand-made bike/helicopter you are flying down into the catacombs of some French town. These catacombs formed a labyrinth are filled with flowers, acid cans and are controlled by your enemies representing dinosaurs, mutants, robots, and undeads. The contact with enemies is lethal for you, so you have to find the flowers of appropriate color, and shoot the balls of such color at the monsters of such color to kill them. Also you should clear your way of acid cans. To do this you should most often fly to appropriate position of complex labyrinth to shoot the can through the gap in the wall. It is because of your ability to shoot in horizontal plane only. To increase your energy you should find the barbecues.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Loriciel", "publishers": "Loriciel", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/S05RiGu9d6A", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/132339"}
