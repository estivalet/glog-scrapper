{"name": "The Scout Steps Out", "overview": "Quite successful grasphisms, a good dozen of tables, a lot of difficulties, funny music: the recipe for a good game. In this game, you must be the example of your troop. Gathered in front of the camp, all your comrades are watching you leave to carry out your good deeds (BA for the elders). You must wash the windows of a boarding school, collect mushrooms while avoiding those that are poisoned, collect samples of marine life in order to study them later in class, master the electronics to be able to repair the camp radio . And that's not all, you will have other missions. But be careful, do not think that we will let you act quietly. Others have too much interest in savoring your failure. It will be necessary to get around obstacles using your address, but also your head.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Amsoft", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109434"}
