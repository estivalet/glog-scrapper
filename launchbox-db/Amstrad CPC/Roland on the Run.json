{"name": "Roland on the Run", "overview": "A bit of a Frogger clone with a frosting of the popular Roland franchise to make it all go down easily. You need to jump from the moving train to open bed trucks or pickups, then to less frequent trucks in the second lane of traffic and then to the hideouts on the side of the road to score. Not just one frog at a time, you need to \"juggle\" quite a number of travelers who need to leave the train and get to the the roadside hideouts quickly. Using keys you can simultaneously progress in different waves at the same time so it can get pretty complex.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Egypt", "publishers": "Epicsoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuQIVTvZPqA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109417"}
