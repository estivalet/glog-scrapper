{"name": "Cubit", "overview": "Noughts and Crosses (tic-tac-toe to North Americans) is brought into three dimensions as you play either a friend or the computer to be the first to line up four tiles in a row. Of course, as well as stopping your opponent making lines on one level, you've also got to keep an eye on them making lines that cross all four levels, if you see what I mean. However, this is easier said than done when you're playing the computer \u2013 maybe the human brain just isn't capable of visualizing the lines in 3D. It's probably better to play with a friend, although the controls are awkward; you have to press fire quickly twice to place a tile, and it often doesn't work.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mr. Micro Ltd.", "publishers": "Amsoft", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/108741"}
