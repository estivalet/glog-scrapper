{"name": "Spannerman", "overview": "This is a very good little arcade game, by Gem Software, who seemed to do the better games for Amsoft.  Every screen has pipes and platforms and ladders and nasty rats.  The pipes start to leak and you have to use your trusty spanner to stop them.  As the water leaks out, it starts to fill up the screen from below, if the water gets too high then it covers some of the platforms and pipes.  This means to fix those pipes you have to hold your breath, once under water a counter starts counting down from 99, once it reaches 0, you drown (it resets when you come up for air).  And if that wasn't bad enough, there are huges rats after you as well AND there is randomly falling debris coming from the top of the screen, which you have to dodge.  To get around the rats you can either jump over them or kick them.<br><br>The action gets quite frantic, with the pipes leaking, the water rising, debris falling and rats everywhere\u2026 you are madly trying to run and jump and climb up and down ladders to fix the leaks.  You know eventually you will croak from something, it's only a matter of time\u2026", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Amsoft", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109545"}
