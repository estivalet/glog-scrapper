{"name": "Laserwarp", "overview": "The Master is threatening to take over the galaxy, and you must stop him. Before you can battle against him, though, you must prove that you are a worthy opponent by fighting your way through eight waves of alien creatures, ranging from whirling dervishes to space mines, interstellar pogos, and hyper space chickens! Of course, it's just another simple clone of Space Invaders with primitive graphics and sound effects, and unexciting gameplay, and there's nothing else for me to say about it.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Indescomp", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU4oLr_d31A", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/108552"}
