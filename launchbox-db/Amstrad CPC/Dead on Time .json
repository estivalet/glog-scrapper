When you kill all the enemies in a formation, they leave capsules. Collect these to grant extra time. Collect three of the same color to get the bullet field. This allows you to absorb enemy impact, for a time.<br>In Score Challenge, there is no time limit but too many impacts will end the game. Score as many points as you can. You can still collect capsules to get the bullet field.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/108833"}
