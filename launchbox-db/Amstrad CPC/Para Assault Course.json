{"name": "Para Assault Course", "overview": "Para Assault Course is a game that allows you to train like a paratrooper and attempt four assault courses in the fastest time. You can attempt each course in competition mode or practise mode with both being played solo or against a friend and there are three levels of difficulty. You can also have a preview of each course. The actual game is viewed from the side and the screen scrolls from left to right as you waggle the joystick (or keyboard) left to right to move. If playing in two player mode then the screen is split into two and you compete at the same time. There are various obstacles you need to clear to complete the course and these include walls, parallel bars, rope swing, thin wall and a death slide. The winner is the person with the fastest time.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Zeppelin Games", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109082"}
