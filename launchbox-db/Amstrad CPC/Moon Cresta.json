{"name": "Moon Cresta", "overview": "Moon Cresta is a vertical scrolling shoot-'em-up. The action involves the player moving their ship along the base of the screen, while wave after wave of aliens come towards it. The yellow aliens split when shot, while the magenta ones are the toughest of all. Once the coast is clear, the player must attempt to manually dock their ship in a limited amount of time. Docking successfully will earn the player bonus points.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Alternative Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtube.com/watch?v=KvXJtAH3xGI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/108786"}
