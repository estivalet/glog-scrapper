{"name": "The Jetsons", "overview": "The definition of a game as defined in the Oxford dictionary is \u20181. an amusement or pastime\u2019 or \u20182. a contest with rules, the result being determined by skill, strength, or chance\u2019. Bearing these in mind one wonders whatever possessed the Hi-Tec peeps to release this with the word \u2018game\u2019 anywhere on the disk or packaging. Fair enough it does pass the time, but then so does a party political broadcast. This, not to put too fine a point on it, is pretty tedious stuff indeed. Initial impressions are more favourable, however. You can\u2019t deny The Jetsons looks pretty much like you\u2019d expect Hanna-Barbera\u2019s family of second- string cartoon characters to look, but decent-enough- cartoony-graphics is about as far as its list of good points goes. To be honest, the list of bad points is equally short - there\u2019s no gameplay to speak of here at all. All that happens is, one after another, members of our 1950s-style space family explore a boring space-age maze, dodging dull traps and picking up the odd even-more-boring collectables. Obviously Hi-Tec thought that the graphics and animation were ample to sell this as a \u2018game\u2019 and, indeed, I dare say they\u2019ll sell quite a few on the name alone. Don\u2019t let one of them be you - not least because they\u2019ve got the cheek to charge a distinctly un-budget thirteen quid for it.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Hi-Tec Software", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/130024"}
