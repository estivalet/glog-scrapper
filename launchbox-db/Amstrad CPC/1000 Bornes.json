Driving ahead is done by playing distance cards but they can only be played if a green lights card has been played first. To prevent a player from moving it's possible to play a hazard such as flat tire or out of gas. To start moving again the player needs to play the corresponding remedy card. There are also safety cards that give immunity to hazard cards.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "December 25, 1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Free Game Blot", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/32013"}
