{"name": "Glen Hoddle Soccer", "overview": "Tottenham midfielder Glenn Hoddle got his own game with this Amstrad exclusive football game. The game is played from a sideline perspective, graphically similar to Commodore's Cup Final. The control method is a bit different from other football games, in the way that you simply press the fire button to select the player closest to the ball. Only single matches can be played, no cup or league competitions exist. There's three different skill levels available in the game.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Amsoft", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/108991"}
