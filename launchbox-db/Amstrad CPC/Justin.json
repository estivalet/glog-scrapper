{"name": "Justin", "overview": "Basically, if you remember the hits Head over Heels and Batman, well, it's pretty much the same thing. Justin evolves in a universe while pseudo 2D seen from above, while the characters are in semi 3D. You will therefore have to make Justin evolve diagonally, something which is more than strange at the beginning, but which in the end, becomes something quite natural. Suddenly, the handling is really very good, but requires a little time to adapt. Finished the good old levels that we travel at a frantic pace, now makes for a title with a slower pace and the grip that miserably lousy. The problem is that the adopted view prevents us from normally appreciating the distance which separates two platforms or from precisely assessing the height of a staircase.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/108565"}
