This clan is known for their dark arts and their deals with the Y\u014dkai (supernatural monsters), and it is believed that they hide it now in Akasaka Castle, trying to subjugate the power of the stone.<br><br>You play the role of the ninja spy, who is on a mission to steal the Golden Tail from the Yiga clan, and hopefully use it to break Kitsune\u2019s Curse.<br>Controls<br><br>The game can be controlled with the keyboard or a joystick.
