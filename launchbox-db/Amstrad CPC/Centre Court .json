Finally, it should be noted that this is the first program from Egypt, which shows that IT has hit all the countries.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/129170"}
