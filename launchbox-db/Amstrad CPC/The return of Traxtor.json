{"name": "The return of Traxtor", "overview": "A thousand years have passed since Traxtor saved us... With his memory long gone, this new game is the story of his legacy. The Return of Traxtor is a very nice puzzle game in the style of Magical Drop. You must match the tiles so they disappear. The graphics are colourful and well drawn with vivid colours. The sound is good with different interesting tunes playing during the game. Where the game excels greatly is the gameplay. This is an incredibly addictive game which requires you to think quickly.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "2015", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Juan J.
