There are 97 of these in the game, so reaching the top of the rankings will take about 15-20 fights. Choosing a beatable opponent who can get the fight as high up the Friday Night bill as possible, as well as negotiating the best financial deal and a mutually agreeable dare, are the main considerations.<br><br>Two different governing bodies are included in the game, each with subtly different rules. A fight in one set of rules won't be viewed quite as significantly by the other.<br><br>The matches are presented from the commentary box, with the two expert analysts exchanging textual descriptions of the key punches, and who is dong the best (a clue to how any judges\u2019 decision would go). Before and during the fights the player can instruct the boxer as to what tactics to adopt.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/108682"}
