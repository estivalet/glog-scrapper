{"name": "Hirise", "overview": "Hi-Rise takes you at high speed into the world of optical illusions and frantic hunting. The principle remains simple: it's a Q'Bert. In other words you must, by passing on the boxes whose soil is composite, make them change color. Three Machiavellian pursuers are there to prevent you from succeeding in your business, only the super-glue you have in limited quantity will allow you to temporarily block your pursuers. The territories to be transformed in each table (the software has 100) are distributed on different levels joined by scales. Beware of the high velocity of the killers in these areas: they will catch you in a few strides.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Bubble Bus Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109040"}
