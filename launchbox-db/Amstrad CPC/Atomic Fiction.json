{"name": "Atomic Fiction", "overview": "To  recover  Kyrium,  the  ore  that  is  the last chance to avert the current energy  crisis, world authorities have selected you as the first R.O.M. pilot,<br>of  which  only  three  working prototypes have been built. This would be easy enough  if  the  eighteen galleries which are to be your theatre of operations were  not  populated  with radioactive monsters and heavy gold ingots. If they collide  with the pipeline that connects you to the surface, you will lose the R.O.M.  To  avoid this, you'll have to use the winch to get the R.O.M. back to safety.  On  the  other  hand,  you  can  absorb  them,  which  will net you a substantial  bonus.  It is also possible to blast monsters and ingots to ashes by  lashing  out  with  an  energy  beam.  You  are  given two of those at the beginning of the game, and will gel one at the end of each level.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Benoit Varasse", "publishers": "Chip", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/127333"}
