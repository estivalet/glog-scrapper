The evil Dargons, masters of the planet Dartress, have masterminded a plot to enslave the populations of the entire galaxy. As a Commander of the Liberation Fleet, it is your mission to stop the Dargons' invasion forces from overrunning the galaxy. The Dargons utilise colony ships, known as RingWorlds, which are ordered to fly towards targeted planets, conquer, and then occupy them. Once occupied, a planet can act as a base for the further expansionist activities of the Dargons. Soon, the evil Dargons will have conquered the entire galaxy - only you can stop them!!!", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Players Premier", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109465"}
