{"name": "Munch-it ", "overview": "Munch-it is based on the arcade game Pac-Man where you have to move around a top view single screen maze and eat all the dots. While your eating the dots, there are three ghosts moving around the maze looking to kill you. If you touch a ghost, then you lose one of three lives. In the four corners of the maze are power-pills, and when eaten allow you to chase and eat the ghosts for a short time. Before the game starts, you can select a skill level (1-4).", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "QuelleSoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/108796"}
