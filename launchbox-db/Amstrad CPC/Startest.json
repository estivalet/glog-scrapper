{"name": "Startest", "overview": "The Time Lord, a being from deep space, has announced a cosmic competition to bring some variety to his infinitely long life. It is the start test. The price is additional years of life. Any form of intelligence can participate, whether spider creatures from Andalus, humans from Earth or sleeping stones from Botchy. But before the longed-for prize, eight tests must be passed, which require both intelligence and dexterity. Few can master them all, but those who do will have their lifespan extended.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Thomas M.
