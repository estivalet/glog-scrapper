{"name": "Seas of Blood", "overview": "You can leave the ship to go pillaging on land \u2013 should you sight it! Mind you, on land you may not find the plundering too straightforward, fox as well as some typical adventure problems, you are likely to meet some stubborn resistance from natives, ghoulies, and ghosties.

What do the sea Sprites want? What i the best way to defeat a zombie? Aha, and there's \"the traditional red-herring in there somewhere, too' Mike Woodroffe told me!<br><br>All this combines with excellent graphics to make a very good adventure, easy enough to get into \u2013 but it's not so simple to tie things up on the mountain top!", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Adventure International", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/127117"}
