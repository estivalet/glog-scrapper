{"name": "Top Gun ", "overview": "The Tom Cruise film featured an F-14 Tomcat plane, and this licensed game recreates this. Viewed from the cockpit in full 3D, the game is a straight head-to-head duel, against another player or the computer. You are armed with missiles (while put you in control of a small target zone, which must remain over your opponent for 3 seconds), flares and cannons (which overheat when overused)- use these more wisely than your opponent. Pay attention to speed and altitude too. The computer has 3 planes to throw at you, of which the last is the toughest, while each player in a 2-player game also has 3 'lives'.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/110270"}
