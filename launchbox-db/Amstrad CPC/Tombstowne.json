{"name": "Tombstowne", "overview": "Your task is to rescue some ripped out pages of a spell book from the Castle of Tombstowne to enable the completed book of spells to lift the curse from the town. The pages are colourful little blue things that are picked up with a flash when you talk into them. Getting to some of the pages is difficult and this is where the adventuring element comes in and you have to solve various problems.<br><br>The rooms are shown in 2D but you can move \"into\" a doorway by jumping up at it, staking you into another room at right angles. Connections are also made just by walking off the edge of a screen or by jumping up staircases to a different level. Each location will contain furniture, ghostly enemies or objects, which may be jumped on, avoided and picked up respectively.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Amsoft", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/110269"}
