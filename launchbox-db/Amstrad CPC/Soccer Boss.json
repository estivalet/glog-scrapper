{"name": "Soccer Boss", "overview": "Take control of a football team in a division below the top one, and try to lead them to glory in both league and European competition. You start with a squad of 12 players, whose names can be changed, but have room for 15 players in total, with chances to buy and sell players. You can take out a bank loan, the level of which depends on your division.<br><br>The team's formation can be customised, and as outfield players are not limited to a single position, you can customise the team's strengths and weaknesses in quite a precise way. Matches are played out by listing scorers as they happen, and are followed by a full list of the division's other results. Finances change after each match to to wages, gate receipts, and possible incidents such as riots and illegal player approaches.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Peaksoft", "publishers": "Alternative Software Ltd.", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/130186"}
