{"name": "Night Boosters", "overview": "Night Boosters is a light cycle game for two players or one player against an AI opponent. The game works like any other games of its kind with the objective being to stay alive as long as possible without crashing into either player's trails or any of the walls. There are also a few obstacles on the screen that have to be avoided. Each player has four lives and when the opponent crashes, the player gets points based on how much time has elapsed. The player that first runs out of lives loses the game regardless of the score.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Cobra Soft", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/130342"}
