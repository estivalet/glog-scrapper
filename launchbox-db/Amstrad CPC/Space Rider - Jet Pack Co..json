{"name": "Space Rider: Jet Pack Co.", "overview": "If you're in the local Job centre looking for an exciting new career, then \"tester for the Space Rider Jet Pack Co.\" may sound appealing. There's travel to the 23rd planet test site, adventure, glamour and the like. What they don't tell you, however, is the rather important fact that the aforementioned planet has been claimed by aliens - big nasty ones, with guns!<br><br>But if the idea of testing new kit in a war zone is your cup of ros\u00e9, then lead on Macduff and become a Space Rider. The mission that has been devised - by those who are nice and snug and safe back on Earth no doubt! - is one of mineral collection. You have to find the route across the planet, zapping bug guys and grabbing any gem stones (there are 99 in all) that happen to fall into your path.<br><br>The gravity (or lack of it) hinders control of the jet pack slightly, with first-timers rocketing upwards rather than floating. Life isn't all that difficult, though, because the only other control to worry about is the gun, and you wouldn't be seen dead without that would you? (Well you might be seen dead, but doing little else!)?<br><br>So the whole game is just bu2zing around blasting and grabbing - nowt that difficult and nowt that thrilling. The complex you end up invading is big, but is all much of a muchness, put together well enough but lacking pace and and any real sense of danger. All of a sudden you're dead, with \"oh what a shame\" more of an apt comment than the usual string of expletives used in gaming.<br><br>Graphically, the game is easy to look at with large (if unoriginal sprites) in strong basic colours. The gun sounds cute, but that's hardly enough to keep anyone riveted.<br><br>All in all, Space Rider mimics it's own story line and appears to be a test and not the real thing. If it were, you'd be more than concerned about the likelihood of death on a cold alien planet, But in Space Rider death's more of an inconvenience than an appointment with the big guy.<br><br>FIRST DAY TARGET SCORE: GET 10 CRYSTALS", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "PAL Developments", "publishers": "Hi-Tec Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/c1FT-_FvS54", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/142805"}
