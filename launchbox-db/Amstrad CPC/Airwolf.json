{"name": "Airwolf", "overview": "The game of the TV show is viewed from the side and puts you in command of an attack helicopter. Your task is to rescue 5 scientists from an underground lair by destroying its layer of protection and then getting to the core. Moving onto a screen at a time you must shoot out anything and everything in your path, including lots of regenerating static targets. Realistic gravity takes effect, so you can't simply hover in a set position.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "June 1, 1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Elite Systems", "publishers": "Amsoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.45", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9h77_veRI4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/28909"}
