{"name": "Frankenstein", "overview": "I am Doctor Victor Frankenstein. I believed... Oh foolish man! I believed I could equal the wonders of God. For I, in my researches had discovered the secret of life! For two wearisome years I experimented with my secrets of life force. Long hours spent in the laboratory tolling over bloddy tissue. Re-animating dead animal muscle: Notes, experiments, more notes, adjustments to my apparatus. My experiments became an obsession! I forgot about food, my body became wasted. My eyes stared wildly from sunken sockets. Friends had deserted me, considering me eccentric, I did not care! For I was destined to stand among the gods! Their equal, a creator... A giver of life itself!", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "CRL Group", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/128780"}
