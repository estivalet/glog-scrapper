{"name": "La Mal\u00e9diction de Thaar", "overview": "In the vein of Poseidon, this pointillist adventure game takes you to the depths of the devastated city. The object of your quest is the Mermaid Sapho. The atmosphere is no longer in mythology but in the \u201czone\u201d of the black jacket with an eagle on the back. The vocabulary used is to match: snooping, clearing, dropping, roaming, beating. The first letter is enough to validate the order. This saves some of the time wasted when viewing graphics. Superb but so slow ... Symbolized by a red cross, you explore the basements of post-nuclear Paris between stalactites and stalagmites or the skeletons of old buildings. The map is divided into zones: Bolivar / Pigalle, Trocad\u00e9ro / Sentier ... The underground harvest is fruitful.Among the rat colonies and skulls you \"prick\" the gomlna, a disc, a crossbow, a defensive bomb or even a tattoo. Glean the maximum of prizes, they will unleash the languages \u200b\u200bof your Interlocutors. No need to mess with the undead, it will cost you a life. Little by little the meetings guide your research, the road to success is above all a matter of patience. A fun and accessible adventure game.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Coktel Vision", "publishers": "Coktel Vision", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/132267"}
