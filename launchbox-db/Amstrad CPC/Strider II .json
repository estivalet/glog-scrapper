{"name": "Strider II ", "overview": "Strider has been called into action to save the people of the planet Magenta, armed with a Gyro laser and matter converter. He must fight his way through a forest, a ruined city, underground colonies, a roof-top battle, and finally the prison ship in which the Megantan leader is held.<br><br>The gameplay is similar to the original, consisting of running, jumping and attacking, with a very dynamic central character. The laser gun can be used while standing still; moving attacks with the sword are still possible, with the two weapons combining similarly to the Switchblade games. Tokens can be collected, which will turn you into a robot to face the end-of-level enemies if enough are collected.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tiertex", "publishers": "U.S. Gold", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109581"}
