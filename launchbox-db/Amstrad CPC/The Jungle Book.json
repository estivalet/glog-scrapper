{"name": "The Jungle Book", "overview": "I had quite wonderful childhood memories of this film, until they got bulldozed by this turgid piece of software. Let\u2019s be fair though - I guess it\u2019s not a complete disaster. It\u2019s presented as if it were a film, the audience lined up along the bottom of the screen. Lose a life, and one of them visibly falls asleep. A cute idea (sadly one of the few). Ah, yes, the game itself. This is a poor flick-screen, arcade-adventure thing, with jungle animals making life that that bit harder. So where have they gone wrong? Well, everywhere. I don\u2019t think I saw a single exciting thing happen the whole time I was playing it - to be honest, it stinks. Just say no. You know it makes sense. Awful in almost every way, it really is quite sad. A contender for worst film tie-in ever, no problem. Disney must be kicking themselves over this one.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Coktel Vision", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/129495"}
