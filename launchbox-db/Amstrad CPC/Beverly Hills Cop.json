{"name": "Beverly Hills Cop", "overview": "Eddie Murphy became a star in the police film Beverly Hills Cop, and it was this license that Tynesoft used to create a game featuring four distinct sub-games, each of which can be practiced from the main screen in some versions. First Axel Foley visits a warehouse to shoot out some bad guys in a Green Beret-influenced sequence.<br><br>The second level (first on the C64 version) involves driving after 3 lorries full of weapons, and shooting them out one by one, Chase HQ-style. Avoid contact and stay on the road to complete this. Next you must cross the grounds of a mansion, shooting anyone who gets in your way.<br><br>The final section is set within the mansion, and is first-person 3D, although with few movement angles and only one enemy on screen at a time.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "May 30, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Subway Software", "publishers": "Tynesoft Computer Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75317"}
