{"name": "Outlaws Reloaded", "overview": "Daniel Colt has returned to the town of his birth to find it overrun with bandits and outlaws. With his Colt pistol, Daniel must clear each level of outlaws while avoiding their bullets. Your enemies run from one side of the screen to the other, or they can appear from windows, taking aim at you. Certain objects can also be shot, and they may reveal bonuses, such as money or a can of cola (which gives you an extra life). This game won the 2016 #CPCRetroDev Game Creation Contest overall and it also received two additional awards, and deservedly so. The graphics are beautiful and very colourful, the music and sound effects are excellent, and the action is fast-paced; you'll need good reflexes to survive!", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "2016", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "cpcretrodev.byterealms", "publishers": "", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/153111"}
