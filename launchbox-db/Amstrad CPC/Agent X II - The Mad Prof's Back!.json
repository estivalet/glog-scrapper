{"name": "Agent X II: The Mad Prof's Back!", "overview": "With Agent X having been a success in both critical and commercial terms, a sequel was inevitable. The Mad Professor's cunning plan this time is to infect everybody with acne, thus causing the economy to crumble (and not just the economy for Valentine's cards). As with the original, the game is split into distinct sections - as with the original these are each loaded one at a time.<br><br>The first section is a horizontally-scrolling shoot 'em up, where Agent X flies freely and must collect powerful weapons to be able to get through. This is followed by some platform action, which involves climbing a tower collecting code pieces along the way. The final section is a Breakout clone, pre-dating Arkanoid as the first game to give a plot behind basic brick-bashing, with the twist that a moving bat at the top of the screen fires the ball back towards you unpredictably.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Software Creations Ltd.", "publishers": "Mastertronic Ltd.", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/74760"}
