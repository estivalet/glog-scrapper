{"name": "Solar Coaster", "overview": "Solar Coaster is a fast and furious space shoot-em-up, alien annihilation at its most basic level. Your mission is to shoot each wave of aliens defending their moihership and then to blow that up again.<br><br>There are four levels. The first, second and third are pure and simple alien-bashing. They differ in shape and colour from one level to another. They also think up new ways of diving and bombing you.In the first level, the aliens swoop down randomly with varying speed and accuracy. They drop bomb after bomb in their never-ceasing mission to blow you off the face of the universe.<br><br>Movement left and right causes your ship to tilt quite realistically. You'll be thankful for the option to thrust it higher up the screen. This can make the difference between life and death.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Optyx", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109464"}
