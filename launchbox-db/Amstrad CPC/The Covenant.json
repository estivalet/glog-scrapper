{"name": "The Covenant", "overview": "The eponymous Covenant refer to a long lost parchment which carries the entire cultural record of long dead people, who have now mutated and are scattered along with fragments of the Covenant among the 256 caverns of a subterranean world. Your task is to find the 64 pieces of parchment and also to gather the mutant creatures, so that when you have the complete parchment the planet surface can be repopulated. <br><br>You travel in a globe armed with a stun gun. The globe itself is rather difficult to control! Whenever you or it come into contact with a creature, energy will be lost, so your first task in any cavern is to stun the creatures within and take them on board by maneuvering your craft over them.<br><br>The whole cave system is divided up into blocks of four rooms. Each area has a key, a piece of the Covenant and some anesthetic. The latter refills the stun gun; you must stun all the creatures in a zone before you can move onto the next area.<br><br>You only have one life, so be careful! However, lost energy can be regained by standing on a power point. At any stage of the game you can see your current status by pressing the space bar.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Paul Hutchinson", "publishers": "Ere Informatique", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe35Msm7Y-8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/108745"}
