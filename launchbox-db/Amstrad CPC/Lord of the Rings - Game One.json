{"name": "Lord of the Rings: Game One", "overview": "Welcome! You are about to enter one of the most famous and well loved fantasy worlds in the annals of fantasy fiction: J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle Earth. Melbourne House, in association with the Tolkien estate, are proud to present the Lord of the Rings adventure game. The background to the Lord of the Rings includes some events with which a player of the game The Hobbit will be familiar. This is the first game in a series of three, which deals with the material found in Tolkien's The Fellowship of the Ring, the first book in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Subsequent games will deal with the stories covered in the next two volumes in the series, The Two Towers and The Return of the King. In the Lord of the Rings adventure game, you will be able to play the role of one of the four Hobbits: FRODO, SAM, MERRY and PIPPIN. FRODO bears a magic ring of power, a ring which, in the hands of the DARK LORD, could cause the destruction of all that you hold dear. You will need all of the cunning and luck at your disposal to complete your quest and survive. In playing this adventure game, you in effect assume the role of the characters from J.R.R. Tolkien's fantasy world. You must detail out the actions that you will perform, your reactions and movements, and the computer will perform them accordingly. Best of luck my furry-footed friend. The fate of the entire world of Middle Earth rests upon you alone, but don't let that pressure you ...", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Melbourne House", "publishers": "Beam Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/132266"}
