In a strange dwelling strewn with traps and pitfalls , our six detectives face each other in the greatest uncertainty. On each game turn, only people in the same room are allowed to watch the screen. In view of the reactions of your partners, you identify the purpose of each. The action is then coupled with an astonishing climate of suspicion where alliances are more than ephemeral! If it is indeed important to preserve its own existence, the many puzzles encountered in each room will only increase the difficulty of your maneuvers.
