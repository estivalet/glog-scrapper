The game comes with a very limited range of items, 'knowing' just two objects in each category. When the player submits an item the game does not have in its database the player is asked how the new item differs from the best answer the game could give. This information is then stored and so the game's repertoire grows.<br><br>The game allows the player to review, edit, and store the database.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Bourne Educational Software", "publishers": "Amsoft", "genres": "Party", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/77353"}
