The battle to defeat the Vampire Master is underway, and Jasper must complete the job if he is ever to wake up again.<br><br>Jump through the 8 screens, collecting all the crosses before going through the exit, and avoiding snakes and other hazards. Watch out for booby traps, and make sure not to touch the crosses when they have become burning effigies - either of these indiscretions costs one of your nine lives. The Master must be defeated five times before the world is finally safe.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Shockerzoft", "publishers": "Radical Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/98761"}
