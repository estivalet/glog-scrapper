{"name": "Roland Goes Square Bashing", "overview": "A logic puzzle game in the popular Roland game series. In this game Roland looks a little more square and squashed than usual but he has a very square job to accomplish, as the goal of the game is to visit each square in the game area just a single time as they start to dissolve as soon as you step on them. So you have a short period of time to determine the path that will get you to every square and then you have to do it with a quickness or go falling into space. <br>It isn't exactly Ethel the Aardvark goes Quantity Surveying but it ramps up to a pretty good challenge.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Simon Francis", "publishers": "Durell Software", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOH4E33aMRw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109414"}
