{"name": "A Midsummer Day's Dream", "overview": "You are sitting on a grassy bank alongside a small stream trying to come up with a new idea for an adventure when a small red dragon about a foot high, scuttles past through the long grass. It peers anxiously at a cheap Japanese digital wrist-watch and mumbles something about being late for a Convention. As you've had no luck with a new idea for your adventure, you decide to follow it. The dragon coughs quietly to itself and sets fire to the field in the process, then it sets off in the direction of the woods.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Peter CLARK", "publishers": "The Adventure Workshop", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/81022"}
