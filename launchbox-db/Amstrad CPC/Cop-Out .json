{"name": "Cop-Out ", "overview": "Cop-Out is a crosshair shooting game. The player controls a prohibition-era policeman who must shoot his way through 10 levels of criminals, jeeps and bi-planes, as well as birds and bottles. If the player survives long enough they will advance to the next level.<br><br>The player can walk left and right at the bottom of the screen, while at the same time moving a crosshair to shoot at the targets. When shooting, the bullets take a while to get to the crosshair point so the player must shoot a little ahead of the targets. Walking is necessary to avoid the bullets and molotov cocktails that the enemies shoot or throw down the screen.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Mikro-Gen", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/108729"}
