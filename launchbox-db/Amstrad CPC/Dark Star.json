There are plenty of energy dumps along the way, which you'll need to collect in order to be able to reach all 256 sectors. The game is largely customizable, with almost all controls redefinable, and the speed and power of the enemy variable.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Design Design", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/96746"}
