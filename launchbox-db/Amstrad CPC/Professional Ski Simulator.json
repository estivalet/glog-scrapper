{"name": "Professional Ski Simulator", "overview": "Players have to guide a skier down the piste in the specified time limit. The ski is against a competitor but the clock is the main enemy because if the player doesn't cross the finishing posts in time it is game over. The controls are fairly simple: left and right on the joystick rotates the skier and the fire button propels the player character forward with his sticks. Avoid obstacles such as trees, gates or log cabins.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Codemasters", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/129505"}
