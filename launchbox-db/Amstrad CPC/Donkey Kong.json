{"name": "Donkey Kong", "overview": "Donkey Kong is a platform-action game that has Mario scale four different industrial-themed levels (construction zone, cement factory, an elevator-themed level, and removing rivets from girders) in an attempt to save the damsel in distress, Pauline, from the big ape before the timer runs out. Once the rivets are removed from the final level, Donkey Kong falls, and the two lovers are reunited. From there, the levels start over at a higher difficulty.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Arcana Software", "publishers": "Ocean Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.26", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNXLsobO3Gk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/28395"}
