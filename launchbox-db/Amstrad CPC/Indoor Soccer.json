{"name": "Indoor Soccer", "overview": "Indoor football is recreated in this game notable for the large amount of colour clash during play. There are walls around the pitch, off which the ball ricochets in play, and 5 players on each team. There are no dead-ball plays other than centres and penalties. 3 skill levels are available, as are 2-player games. Off-the-ball fighting is a common feature of the game, which can lead to penalties being awarded.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Alternative Software", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109066"}
