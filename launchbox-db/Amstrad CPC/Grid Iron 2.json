{"name": "Grid Iron 2", "overview": "This (American) football management game uses a menu-driven system. There are 16 teams to choose from; the Dolphins, Packers and 49ers are all in there. Players are rated out of 10 on skill, energy and form. Player trading is handled in a soccer-style transfer market, rather than with a US 'draft' format - mid-season trades for money are common. Matches have no direct tactical input, and are viewed from remote highlight shots, which do not have the distinct pitch markings of the original (an old Softstone game released under three different names).", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109008"}
