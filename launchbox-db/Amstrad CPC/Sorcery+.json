{"name": "Sorcery+", "overview": "The player embodies a magician whose goal is to find and deliver 8 colleagues who were captured by a necromancer. The environment, represented in profile, is made up of about forty paintings interconnected by doors (one place can give access to four other places), which makes it complex to explore. To carry out his quest, he must discover the usefulness of the many objects found along the way and get rid of the enemies that threaten him. The player only has a few minutes to complete the mission, which requires reflexes, sense of direction, memory, and tactical sense.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "January 1, 1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gang of Five", "publishers": "Amsoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBBrKcBfmkk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/28531"}
