The gameplay is viewed from above and behind the net, with a slight 3D effect. The type of shot played is determined by how high the ball is as you hit it. The full service rules are implemented, and the fire button must be pressed once to throw the ball up, and a second time to hit it with the racket.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Codemasters", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/125017"}
