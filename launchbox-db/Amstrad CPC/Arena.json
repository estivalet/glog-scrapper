{"name": "Arena", "overview": "In the year 2027 Earth bound conflicts and disputes were resolved by a return to a medieval concept. You have been selected to compete in the magnificent Battle Arena for the currently vacant position of Champion of England following last month's death in combat, of your predecessor during a bout against Wales. To succeed, you must demonstrate your command of the battle field tactics together with a keen mental agility. Searching the battle fields for signs of your opponent, you have the facility to view the areas of the battle field and the locations of your slave tanks. The speed with which you absorb reports and give orders to your slave tanks will determine your life expectancy in the most hazardous career. Control of all weapons systems is effected only from your command tank, combat being displayed on your master console giving vector graphic display of the movement and action of enemy units. Ammunition is strictly limited and you are well advised to hold your fire until you can see the whites of their V.D.U's.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/125472"}
