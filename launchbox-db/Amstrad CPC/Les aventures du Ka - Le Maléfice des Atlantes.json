{"name": "Les aventures du Ka: Le Mal\u00e9fice des Atlantes", "overview": "Since the earliest times, two legendary worlds have clashed in the depths of the oceans: the kingdom of Neptune and the Atlantean continent. The current rumor would like to see the Atlanteans take the advantage and the fragile balance established by the God of the sea would risk being broken ... and storm, hurricane, tidal wave and destruction would ensue. ! Only a series of tests would save Neptune from its \"immobility\", but no Neptunian champion has so far achieved the impossible. Amphytrite, the king's partner, then thought of calling on Karl ADRIX, the \"KA\", whose fame had reached the bottom of the sea. Will it succeed where the fishmen have failed? To finish the game, you must bring Neptune the Vial of Life in the last room of the game.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Chip", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133892"}
