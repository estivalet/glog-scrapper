Although Spanish, the game has almost no text. The Ulysses character moves from left to right throwing hammers to kill an incessant wave of enemies. The game doesn't have levels, but sections within one expansive level. Precise jumps are required to clear abysses and gorges, and to avoid collision with dangerous objects. Ulysses can also crouch. The game starts with three lives, and each rescued damsel adds an extra one. There isn't any form of saving progress.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Opera Soft", "publishers": "Opera Soft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/142827"}
