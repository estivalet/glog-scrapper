{"name": "Dandy ", "overview": "Although directly licensed to John Palevich's earliest interpretation of top-view dungeon-based slashing, this game's features are closest to Gauntlet, the coin-op it inspired.<br><br>You play either Sheba or Thor (both are active in a simultaneous 2-player game) as you move through 15 dungeons, with the aim of collecting all the available treasure. If this is done successfully, a code will be granted - put them all together at the end of the game. Foes are released in swarms through a control box. Once all these are dead you must destroy the box, to prevent respawning.<br><br>The dungeons feature treasure, food (for energy), and spells. Be careful not to destroy these by shooting them. Each spell has a random function - disorientating, paralyzing or killing the opponents on screen. Like Gauntlet you are constantly losing energy, however treasure can be traded in for energy.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Electric Dreams", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/108829"}
