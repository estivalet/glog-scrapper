{"name": "Short's Fuse", "overview": "Special agent Sam Short is tasked with going around the world defusing bomb detonators planted by his archenemy Boris. Bombscare is a pretty straightforward fixed-screen platform fare. Sam jumps around platforms chasing the detonators with 9 seconds to collect each and every one. Once a detonator is defused, the timer resets to 9 seconds. If the timer reaches 0, a life is lost. When all detonators have been defused, the level is cleared and play proceeds to the next one.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/129242"}
