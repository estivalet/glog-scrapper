Graphics adventure in the old sense, ie, a text adventure with graphic illustrations for each scene.<br><br>The graphics are fairly plain, not in the Interceptor league and take a while to draw.<br><br>Nevertheless, they have a certain character and add something to the important part which is the actual text element.<br><br>The title implies that this is something to do with pirates and salty seadogs and (his impression is reinforced by the irritating 'OK me dear' and 'och aye me hearties' style of computer response.<br><br>The plot was quickly engrossing. though, with a lot of possibilities in the opening sections which I always find is the key to getting into an adventure.<br><br>The first object is a rusty torch and you find yourself in a maze of dark tunnels. Fortunately the instructions to get the torch going are relatively simple.<br><br>A good, well-designed game.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Camel Software", "publishers": "Camel Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/129960"}
