{"name": "Alien Break-In", "overview": "An early mix of Galaxian and Space Invaders. Motherships appear in the sky releasing alien invaders that swarm around dropping slow-moving bombs. Pods are also dropped, and if they land, they form into crab-like mutants that crawl along the ground towards you. Luckily, you are able to create holes in the ground to trap and kill these mutants. Well that's the good news, because you can only dig these holes five times in total \u2013 so only good shots need apply here! This game has no progression as such; no levels or stages, just a single screen of endless minions. It's easy at first, but once many pods begin to drop, you end up in trouble.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Romik Software", "publishers": "Amsoft", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seDxJEWv7dk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/74766"}
