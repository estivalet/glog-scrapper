The five stages are:<br><br>The Fighter Stage: Alien ships move about the screen and you have to destroy them all.<br><br>The Asteroid Stage: You must avoid all asteroids moving down the screen.<br><br>Alien Command Ship: A huge ship sits on the screen and you must destroy all it's turrets.<br><br>The A.L.L.O.Y. Robot Stage: A huge robot now sits on the screen and once again it's turrets need destroying.<br><br>Docking Stage: A ship appears on the screen and you must touch the back of it with your craft to re-fuel and move to the next level within a time limit.<br><br>You are armed with a gun to shoot with but if you fire for too long then your ship starts to overheat shown by a gauge. If the gauge fills up then the ship is destroyed. If you touch a ship, asteroid or are shot then that pilot is killed and the next pilot starts from stage one.
