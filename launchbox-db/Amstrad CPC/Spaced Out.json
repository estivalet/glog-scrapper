{"name": "Spaced Out", "overview": "Spaced Out is undeniably a computer board game. Like all good (and not a few bad) games, the rules are simple. There's a grid of points on which players move. The idea is to move your player (a cosmic cowboy in ten-parsec hat and stellar leather boots) from the bottom left of the grid to the top right.<br>Movement is either along or up - no diagonals allowed - and the distance moved is cast by a couple of numbers which try ever so hard to be a pair of dice. No spots, but they do randomly set up two numbers between zero and six. Throwing a double means you move twice.<br><br>There has to be competition, in this case the Nasties. These swarm over the playing area and try to get in your way. You can't jump over them, but you can move on top of one to space it out. Hence the name of the game. You, too, can experience the unique delights of getting well wasted if the Nasties manage to prevent you making any legal move with the numbers the dice give you.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Firebird Software", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109543"}
