{"name": "Relentless", "overview": "Relentless was the winner of CPCWiki's 16KB ROM game development competition held in 2013. As its name implies, get ready for the most relentless 16 kilobytes of action you will ever get. The game begins with a great tune. Straight away, you are plunged into relentless, non-stop shoot-'em-up action with smooth 50fps scrolling. The graphics are very detailed with a great colour selection that does not tire out the eyes. The sprites are creatively designed. The sound is as good as it could be for a 16K game, with numerous effects. The gameplay is really good but sometimes it gets very difficult. Thankfully, you can adjust the difficulty level if you like. The grab factor is strong until you complete it \u2013 something that will not take a lot of time since this game is not lengthy. Overall, this is a good shoot-'em-up.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "2013", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Paul Kooistra", "publishers": "Psytronic Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/153185"}
