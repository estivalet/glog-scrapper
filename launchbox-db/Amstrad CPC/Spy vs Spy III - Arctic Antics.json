{"name": "Spy vs Spy III: Arctic Antics", "overview": "The third and final installment (after Spy vs. Spy and Spy vs. Spy: The Island Caper) sees the spies on an iceberg. They're seeking items (gyroscope, fuel canister, key card) and then seeking to leave via a rocket-ship before a blizzard sets in. New trap items include a saw (for cutting holes in ice), a plunger detonator (with dynamite), an ice pick and snowshoes. There are some pitfalls (thin ice and snow drifts). Hand-to-hand combat is done with snowballs. Watch your spy's body heat or he'll become a permanent resident.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "First Star Software, Inc.", "publishers": "Beyond", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kdLowOue8s", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109557"}
