{"name": "Amnesia", "overview": "So it's very simple:<br>You have circles and crosses. The goal is to place the round in a table (variable size) according to the orders which are in-line head and the table columns. These orders are in the form of numbers (1, 2, 3 or 4) that indicate the number and order of the round to be placed in the row or column. For example, if you have a 2 in a column header, that means you have to place 2 circles side by side in this column. If you have a 3 and 2, then you have to place 3 balls side by side and 2 other side balls next in this column. It's the same for the lines. Finally a table requires that all order (columns and rows) are fulfilled.<br>Another thing: when you finish a painting, you save money. When you have more than 60 pieces, you can \"buy\" the current table if you find it too hard; clear, so you will spend the next level for 60 balls.
