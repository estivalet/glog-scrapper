{"name": "Beyond the Ice Palace", "overview": "This platform romp has similarities to Ghosts 'N Goblins, sending you on a journey to defeat the forces of evil. You start the game with nine lives, and you'll need them although there are only 3 (large) levels, each finishing with a boss. All manner of monsters block your path and must be attacked with your horizontally-travelling daggers. Additional weapons can be collected, as can bonus orbs, and the chance to summon a spirit to attack for you on the toughest sections.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "David Perry", "publishers": "Elite Systems Ltd.", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.73", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/28638"}
