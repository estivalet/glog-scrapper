They start at the top of the screen and<br>They descend through holes, filling them in their path. But<br>To do this, another hole will appear on the same level.<br><br>While all this happens, a BONUS counter is decreasing, so<br>so, when you get home, you'll have the remaining bonuses.<br><br>The faster you get it, the more points you earn.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Britannica Software", "publishers": "Amsoft", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109044"}
