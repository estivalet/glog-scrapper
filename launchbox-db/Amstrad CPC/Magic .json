{"name": "Magic ", "overview": "This is the latest in Macmillan's rather strange software range Strange, because the programs are neither games nor straightforward learning programs, but aim to combine the best of both these worlds. <br><br>The program, with the accompanying booklet, is supposed to teach: he young beginner the rudiments of magical skill, the booklet is useful and informative, but the program really is a waste of time.<br><br>In the booklet you get instructions and diagrams teaching you how to perform a number of classic magic tricks such as making a coin disappear, producing an egg from nowhere or finding a card chosen by a member of the audience. The program aims to let you rehearse these tricks wiht the aid of 'a unique assistant - your computer.'<br><br>Well, give me a person any day. The graphics represent a stage with curtains and flickering foo: lights. You rehearse; he trick with the computer For instance, in 'Number divination a series of figures will appear You. the magician, key in who: you think should be correct If you re right, a crocodile will emerge from a box and gobble up the number It s pretty boring, but if you stick at it it will probably instill the magical routine in your memory.<br>You can also sequence a complete show and choose the musical accompaniment from a number of tunes. Then you can go through the whole tiling with your 'unique assistant'.<br><br>The trouble with this program is that it will appeal only to those with a prior interest in magic and will pretty quickly exhaust even their patience and attention", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Macmillan Software", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/108669"}
