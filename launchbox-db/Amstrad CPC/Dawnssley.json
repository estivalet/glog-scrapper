{"name": "Dawnssley", "overview": "The Gauntlet scenario is revisited in this budget-price game in which Hobbo the Elf and Thor the Warrior are trapped underground, with 27 levels to fight through. Hobbo is armed with fireballs and Thor with axes. <br><br>Keys must be collected to open doors, spells must be collected and used as appropriate, and energy recharges can be collected. The two-player mode is competitive, with each player capable of harming each other. Monsters emerge from the walls as you travel, and must be either killed or avoided, as contact with them drains your energy.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Top Ten", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/96747"}
