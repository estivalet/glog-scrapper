{"name": "Space Moves", "overview": "Commando Shura has been given orders to travel to an enemy space station and find and destroy a laser weapon on board the station. This game, which is an updated version of the winning entry in the 2015 #CPCRetroDev Game Creation Contest, is divided into two parts that load separately, like many Spanish games of old. In the first part, you must negotiate enemy territory and reach the space station by various means \u2013 firstly by parachute, then by quad bike, and finally by spaceship. In the second part, you must explore the station and find 6 disks to insert into the computers around the base in order to retrieve the code for arming the bomb that will destroy the laser. The graphics are very colourful and the second part is fun to play (even if the music isn't so good), but the first part unfortunately suffers from an unreasonably high difficulty level.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "2015", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Toni Ram\u00edrez", "publishers": "", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/153167"}
