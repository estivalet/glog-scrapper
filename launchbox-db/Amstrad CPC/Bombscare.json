{"name": "Bombscare", "overview": "Special agent Sam Short is tasked with going around the world defusing bomb detonators planted by his archenemy Boris.<br><br>Bombscare is a pretty straightforward fixed-screen platform fare. Sam jumps around platforms chasing the detonators with 9 seconds to collect each and every one. Once a detonator is defused, the timer resets to 9 seconds. If the timer reaches 0, a life is lost. When all detonators have been defused, the level is cleared and play proceeds to the next one.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dollarsoft", "publishers": "Firebird Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsY8Fed2B9I", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/127370"}
