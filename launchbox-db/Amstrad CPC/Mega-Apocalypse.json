{"name": "Mega-Apocalypse", "overview": "It is a very strange universe really - isn\u00b4t it? All those millions of planets and moons and stars and comets swirling about in the vastness of space. Imagine what fun it would be to explore - to boldly go where no boldly goer had boldly gone before - unless they happened to live there. <br><br>Latest research from the Institute of Advanced Research (I.A.R.) indicated that there are quite a lot of planets with things living on them. Some of these things are pretty intelligent like us really. Other of these things are really stupid, like whelks, for example. <br><br>Anyway, to cut a long story short, you have been selected to explore the universe, boldly seeking out strange and exciting new worlds. If you find any, your instructions are quite clear. <br><br>BLAST THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS OUT OF THEM!!", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "John K.
