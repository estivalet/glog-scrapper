{"name": "The Trial of Arnold Blackwood", "overview": "Arnold Blackwood awakes in the grounds of Lord Erebus's estate, but why is he there? He can work out that he would not be there without the Lord's authority so he must be carrying out a job for the old man. His only hope is to pick up enough clues so that he can complete the mission without Erebus suspecting Blackwood's loss of memory, and as you are with him, you can give him a helping hand.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Colin Harris", "publishers": "Nemesis", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/142816"}
