{"name": "Atomic Driver", "overview": "You are driving a small car, in a small town where the streets are swamped in atoms. These can be shot and must be avoided. There are power-ups to freeze atoms for a time. There are also barriers in the road, which must be shot, but can't be shot while you are right next to them. The road network is complex and mazelike, with only a small amount on screen at a time, so a sense of direction is required. You only have one life, so a crash with an atom in town means the end of your driving. Score you earned will be written in Hi-Scores table.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "December 16, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Loriciels", "publishers": "Loriciels", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/79568"}
