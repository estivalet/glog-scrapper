{"name": "Starlife", "overview": "We are in the Middle Ages; beings from another planet have landed on Earth not with very good intentions. Let's do some history.

I'm not saying the best because of its virtues, but because its inhabitants were \u201ccousins\u201d enough to be able to take it without any problem.<br><br>Heh heh !! What they don't know is that our alter ego will defend us. Because it is so, right?
