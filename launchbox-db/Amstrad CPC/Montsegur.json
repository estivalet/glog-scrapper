{"name": "Montsegur", "overview": "A french language text adventure with added graphics. If you have issues reading cursive you will have an extra level of difficulty on this. The scene takes place in the Ch\u00e2teau de Monts\u00e9gur, a major tourist attraction and stronghold of Catharism. Your goal: to find the Holy Grail or philosopher's stone.<br><br>The game is designed to be run on a monochrome or color monitor. The characters have been completely redefined, which gives the text a very nice effect. In this adventure game, you will not need to search for the vocabulary: it is given to you. Likewise, a plan of the castle will guide your first steps.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Christian Hugel", "publishers": "Norsoft", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/142778"}
