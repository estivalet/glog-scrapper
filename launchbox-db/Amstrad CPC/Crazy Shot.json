{"name": "Crazy Shot", "overview": "This is a rather simple shooting range game simulating what one might find in an amusement park. From the menu you can choose between six different shooting range events such as shooting at moving ducks or shooting at balloons. When you run out of time or bullets you are presented with a prize that corresponds to how well you did on the event, for example a key ring if your aim was really bad.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hitech Productions", "publishers": "Loriciel", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/129164"}
