{"name": "Arquimedes XXI", "overview": "Your objective is to enter the base, place the bomb particle beam on the central generator and escape. Said like that, it looks easy, especially when we know that labor moist is already done and you just activate the countdown detonator. You have 1200 seconds to escape, or else you will fly to pieces like the whole base. Entering was easy, but the security system has detected your presence and robots arrive. At work ! No time to waste !", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "2011", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "ESP Soft", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/79164"}
