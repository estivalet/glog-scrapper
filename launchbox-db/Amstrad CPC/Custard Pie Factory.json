{"name": "Custard Pie Factory", "overview": "You have returned to the factory after your holidays to fine a big flap on. The factory is in chaos, nothing seems to be working and there's an order due out. As the factory handy man, it is your job to see that the order is delivered on time.<br><br>But what to do first? There is so much to do. The generator has run out of fuel, the milk vats and custard powder hoppers are empty and the sugar levels are low. But of course as the boss said \"I don't want it finished in any hurry, yesterday will do,\" nice man that. As far as you are concerned you'll be glad when all of your work is done and you can climb into the cab of the works van and deliver the pies. Good luck and don't worry, it's just your job that's at stake.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Tynesoft Computer Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1cnyckqVuA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/108742"}
