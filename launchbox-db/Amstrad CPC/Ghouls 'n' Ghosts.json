{"name": "Ghouls 'n' Ghosts", "overview": "Ports of Ghouls 'n Ghosts were released in Europe in 1989 for the Amstrad CPC, Amiga, Atari ST, Commodore 64, and ZX Spectrum. These ports were all handled by Software Creations and all omit a great deal of detail from the arcade version.<br><br>The gameplay for Ghouls 'n Ghosts is similar to that of Ghosts 'n Goblins. The player controls the knight Arthur, who must advance through a series of eerie levels and defeat a number of undead and demonic creatures in his quest to restore all the people killed by Lucifer (Loki in the English-language Sega Genesis and Master System versions), including his beloved Princess Prin-Prin, back to life. Along the way, Arthur can pick up a variety of weapons and armor to help him in his quest. While the core gameplay remains the same as its predecessor, the game now allows Arthur to fire directly upward and directly downward while in mid air.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Software Creations", "publishers": "Kixx", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.32", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbZVmi9hiG0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/28413"}
