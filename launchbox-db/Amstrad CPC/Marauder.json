{"name": "Marauder", "overview": "Captain C T Cobra has the task of travelling through planet Mergatron where the jewels of Ozymandias have been placed by their captors. The road is long and tough but he has a Battlecar at his disposal.<br><br>You play Cobra as he journeys vertically, taking out the mounted turrets and enemy cars as he goes. There are also colored turrets to shoot at - each colour represents a particular change to your car's performance (there are a few temporary negative ones alongside the upgrades). You have 16 smart bombs, which may sound generous, but just watch them go. A boss must be beaten at the end of each level.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Arcanum Software Developments", "publishers": "Hewson Consultants Ltd.", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/108747"}
