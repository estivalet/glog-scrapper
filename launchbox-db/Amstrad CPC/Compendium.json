The differences being that if you bump into one of other any other character on the board your turn will end and the next players begins. In Snakes and Hazards there are also some objects that stop your movement because your piece likes it, Sniffer the dog likes lampposts and bones for example.<br><br>In Shove-a-Sledge you push Tiny Tim on a sledge and try to make him stop in each of ten different zones in the snow. The first player to stop him in all ten zones wins the game. In Tiddly Drinks the family is in the local pub.
