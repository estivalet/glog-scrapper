{"name": "Le Sceptre d'Anubis", "overview": "Le Sceptre d'Anubis is a French text-based adventure game with graphics set in the Pyramid of Djoser. The player takes a role of an experienced archeologist on vacation in Egypt, who occasionally discovered an ancient papyrus in one of the souks or Cairo. Deciphering its hardly readable hieroglyphs, he realized that the secret entrance within this pyramid leads to the tomb of Amenhotep II, holding the gift of the gods: The Scepter of Anubis. Trying to find it, the archeologist was going on an expedition equipped with a high-tech hieroglyph decryptor, a flashlight, and a gun, but forgetting to take a water. So, typing in the commands in form of \"verb + noun\", the player should help the archeologist to find the Scepter of Anubis avoiding the numerous traps and hostile pyramid's inhabitants.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Eric Chahi", "publishers": "Micro Programmes 5", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/142755"}
