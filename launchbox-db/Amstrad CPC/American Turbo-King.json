{"name": "American Turbo-King", "overview": "The object of the game is to drive your turbocharged, armour plated supercar across America. There are 5 stages to your journey: CALIFORNIA BEACH RACE, ROCKY MOUNTAIN PASS, GRAND CANYON JUMP, GREAT LAKES STAGE, NEW YORK CITY IN SIGHT. Steer through rough terrain and drive over ramps to jump over rocks and other obstacles but you must avoid driving through water as your car will become waterlogged and unable to continue.
