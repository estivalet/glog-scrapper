In pus v / ho periodically leap up and down. If you clear them you ascend a ladder and try to hop on a rapidly moving platform Get to the top of the screen and you go on to the next wall. Which looks remarkably like the first.<br><br>But now you're faced v / ith the additional problems of rocks dropping down and a rampaging duck patrolling the screen.
