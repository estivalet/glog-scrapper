{"name": "Stryker in the Crypts of Trogan", "overview": "As a noble and righteous wizard, you must beat the evil Trogan the Diabolical. This involves travelling through flick-screen Switchblade style environments both above and below ground. Using your sword, you must flatten Trogan's many henchmen, and avoid skeletons. You have limited energy, but can collect top-ups. Tokens to both improve and weaken your weaponry are also scattered throughout. The Amstrad version adds a silhouetted backdrop (similar to that in the C64 version) when ran on the Amstrad Plus, making it the only cassette-based game released in the UK to cater to the system.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Simmer Software", "publishers": "Codemasters", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/131052"}
