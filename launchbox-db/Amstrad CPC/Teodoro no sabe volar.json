{"name": "Teodoro no sabe volar", "overview": "Teodoro No Sabe Volar is a great arcade adventure game that features great graphics, fast-paced gameplay and strong grab factor. The graphics are really cool; something between \"Rick Dangerous II\" and \"Phantomas Saga: Infinity\", they have great colours, smooth animation and great sprite design. The scenery is also very detailed. A minus here is the small playing screen. The sound is not the strong point of this game but it is adequate and fairly supports the game. The gameplay is excellent; assisted by the graphics and the good collision detection, the scenery keeps evolving and changing until the game is completed. This is a magnificent, albeit short, gem.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "2012", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dimension Z", "publishers": "Retroworks", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/153184"}
