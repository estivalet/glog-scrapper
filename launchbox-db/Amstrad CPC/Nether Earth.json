{"name": "Nether Earth", "overview": "Nether Earth is a realtime strategy game that takes place in the distant future. A war is being waged between humans and ancient race of aliens called Insignian. On their mysterious planet there are four bases to capture - Kerberus, Tarras, Faretra and Diolkos. Use factories to build giant battle robots, similar to Mech units in other games. Commanding robots, capturing factories and defeating enemies in realtime are the player's primary goals.<br><br>The player controls a small flying robot, instead of mouse cursor. With this robot the player can enter a factory to design unique battle robot from parts like wheels, antigrav, radar, laser gun or nuclear weapons. After that the player has to command the robot. Artificial intelligence works well at first, but in tough times it is possible to control the robot manually. As the balance of power changes with each conquered base, the player must also adjust strategies and tactics.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Argus Press Software", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/108802"}
