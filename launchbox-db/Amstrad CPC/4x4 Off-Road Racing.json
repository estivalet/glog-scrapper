{"name": "4x4 Off-Road Racing", "overview": "As well as recreating off road racing, this game has considerable capability to upgrade your vehicle. There are four choices of vehicle on offer, each of which has its own weight/top-speed/build strength and so on, and thus is suited to different circuits. You can also buy upgrades and repairs, including carrying some spares.<br><br>There are four completely different types of course, each taking place on a different surface - Mud, Ice, Desert and Mountains. Each of these is littered with hazards, which can either be painstakingly avoided, or driven through (with the resultant risk of damage).", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ogdan Micro Design, Inc.", "publishers": "Epyx", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.57", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE450W8B9Gs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/74743"}
