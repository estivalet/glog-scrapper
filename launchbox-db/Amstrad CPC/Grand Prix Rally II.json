{"name": "Grand Prix Rally II", "overview": "Ten testing stages await the potential rally-driver in a reasonable version of the old arcade classic Pole Position. There are six different types of weather conditions you have to drive in with each one presenting its own particular problems that may stop you completing a stage within the time limit.<br><br>Your screen view is of the back of your car as it heads along the curving road encountering other uniform cars as it goes. Acceleration is automatic, leaving you free to control left-right movement and the brake. At full speed you approach the other cars very fast, but unless you meet them on a corner they are easy to pass. Every car you pass gives you more time to complete the stage while crashing takes a large chunk off your allowed time.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Loriciels", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/108997"}
