{"name": "Detective", "overview": "Detective is a game of deduction and tactics. It is set in an English country house, where the body of the butler, foully murdered, has been found dumped at the top of the staircase. Each player takes the role of one of the characters in the game, and each of you falls under the suspicion of Scotland Yard. Unimpressed by the police, you each decide to clear yourselves by finding out who committed the crime, the weapon used, the place of the murder and the killer's motive.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Argus Press Software", "publishers": "Amsoft", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/108849"}
