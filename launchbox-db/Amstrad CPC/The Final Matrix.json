{"name": "The Final Matrix", "overview": "An impossible mission has fallen into the most improbable hands. Poor Nimrod is sent to rescue a few of his Biopton companions from the hands of the brutal Cratons, who have imprisoned them in a chain of prison planets collectively known as \"The Matrix\".<br><br>Nimrod must travel throughout the galaxy, infiltrate each planet where matrix activity is detected and rescue his friends. He may use the objects left at his disposal, such as TV cameras, which provide valuable intel about each complex, the ammo crates, which contain weapons needed to defeat the disruptors and guards, and the building blocks, which can be used as protection or to activate weight sensors.<br><br>At the same time, he must avoid, if possible, the armed guards, the disruptors, which will block his way, the mines and the black ice. Once Nimrod locates a hostage, he needs to take him to the landing zone and extract him to his spaceship in order to complete the rescue.<br><br>\"The final matrix\" is an isometric arcade with adventure elements, such as puzzles and traps. A novelty feature is that every matrix can be entered at any time, following no particular order, which may appeal to casual players.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Gremlin Graphics", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/108960"}
