{"name": "Rad Zone", "overview": "The colonisation team had almost completed their task when a nuclear power unit went super-critical. The base had to be abandoned. It is now down to you to make the planetoid safe again! You do this by moving around the planetoid, \"decontaminating\" it - collecting all the radioactive objects - and when each screen is cleared, it becomes a Safe Zone. A screen which no longer exposes you to radiation - something which happens all the time in non-safe screens. Of course, there are highly radioactive life forms to avoid as well. Once all screens have been made safe, you complete the game. You have a few spare radiation suits (lives) on the start screen. Without a suit, you are highly vulnerable.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Mastertronic", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109233"}
