{"name": "The Brick", "overview": "The Brick is an Arkanoid clone embodied in the interior of a mechanic system. As such, you will have to help the racket (in this case, a nut), to impulse the ball in order to break as much bricks as possible, although there would be others that will be indestructible by your hit. To make your work more complex, there will be some flying enemies that will modify the trajectory of your ball and in the worst of the cases even shot at you, thus reducing your energy bar. In order to avoid being defeated by these creatures, you have one laser which just one projectile that recharges itself occasionally, so you will have to use it wisely too.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Diabolic Software", "publishers": "Delta Software S.L.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/130865"}
