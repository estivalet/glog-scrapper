{"name": "Les Griffes De La Nuit", "overview": "You have been contacted by an old scientist friend who wants to show you the fruits of his last experiences. So you join him in his isolated cottage in the heart of the Pyrenees. But your stay will not go as planned. <br><br>This second title developed by Bruno Fronters contrasts with The Forgotten Island. The action is nowadays on a thriller background and the parser has left room for a \"point'n click\" interface of the most beautiful effect. Alas, if the context of the island paradise seemed to inspire the author, it feels much less comfortable here with a really wobbly story. The title, however, foreshadowed scenes worthy of the great horror movies of the 80s but the souffl\u00e9 falls quickly. Interactive objects are not necessarily visible and we tend to fall on them by chance. You still have to be desperate before having the crazy idea of \u200b\u200bfeeling rocks! As for the outcome... let's say that it can be puzzling. The scenery, superb although few, however, is a good motivation to discover The Claw of the Night, an adventure that finally takes place in broad daylight.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bruno Fronters", "publishers": "", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/99516"}
