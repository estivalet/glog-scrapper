{"name": "Epimetheus", "overview": "\"The Martians are coming!\" Once again the alien hordes erupt with a new space invasion and once again someone has to help contain it until victory is achieved. So once again we invite the player to strike down everything that moves on the screen. The objective of the game is to defeat ninety-nine waves of space artifacts that follow one after another, as well as take down the meteors and flying saucers that appear from time to time to make things more difficult, in a margin of ninety minutes. The player has a spaceship capable of traversing the playing area in all eight directions and shooting forward. The attacking space artifacts have a very limited firing capacity, but they undertake suicide \"kamikaze\" tactics to pursue the player and crash into him. They also attack in groups and gain stamina and maneuverability as the game progresses.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "2019", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "CNGSoft", "publishers": "", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151290"}
