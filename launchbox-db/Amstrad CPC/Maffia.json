{"name": "Maffia", "overview": "Learn the Italian accent, put on a soft hat, wear a satisfied and abusive look, and you will have quite the look of the perfect mafioso. Precisely that is what it is, but unfortunately, all the cities that you held in your iron fist were robbed by an opposing gang during your absence. It is you alone, with your submachine gun, who will put the ten cities to fire and blood to recover your property and show all these brats who it is who commands here! No but no jokes! First appears the map of your dear country: Italy, with the ten cities to visit. The game itself takes place in two stages: in the city, facing a wall of building exeepdonnelle-ment ugly, you must shoot anyone appearing at the windows, also without any graphic interest. Second step: the path between two cities that you travel by car, followed by other motorized bandits. The system repeats itself ten times, and ten times you play with excessively simplified graphics, sky-blue windows plated on a rectilinear red brick wall. Quite frankly, they didn't get tired of tweaking the designs. As for car chases, it's a little more beautiful: the vehicles are simple but the roadside decor is pretty, and it's pumped outrageously on Asphalt, as some say. It is all the same and despite everything the best passage of the game, when you zigzag between cars and motorcycles.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Cosmic Software", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/130508"}
