{"name": "Turbo Esprit", "overview": "You are a special agent trying to prevent a gang of drug smugglers from completing drug deliveries using your high tech Lotus Esprit car. You can either track down and destroy the cars or ram them until they no longer function. Travel around four cities and find the evil drug lords. HQ helps by keeping you up do date on an armoured car targeted by the baddies on your map. Stop them before they transfer the drugs and flee to a new city, but be careful they are wily and may be using duplicate courier cars.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "May 8, 1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mike Richardson", "publishers": "Durell Software Ltd", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/108146"}
