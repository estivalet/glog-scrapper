{"name": "Daley Thompson's Decathlon", "overview": "The player takes part in the ten events of the modern decathlon: Day 1: 100 metres, Long jump, Shot putt, High jump, 400 metres Day 2: 110 hurdles, Pole vault, Discus, Javelin, 1500 metres The player starts the game with three lives; failure to reach the minimum standard in an event results in the loss of one life. Success in the 1500 Meters event results in the game returning to Day 1 to repeat the events with more difficult qualification criteria. Running is simulated by hitting two keys (representing the left and right leg) alternately and as quickly as possible. The game rapidly gained a reputation amongst players as a \"joystick killer\" because of the constant vigorous waggling of the joystick required during many of the events.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ocean Software", "publishers": "Ocean Software", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/88477"}
