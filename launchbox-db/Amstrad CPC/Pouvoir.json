{"name": "Pouvoir", "overview": "It starts doing well: Lori-clicks has yet to get out a good software! It's intolerable ! I waited impatiently for their last to be able to drag him into the mud pitifully and here they make us a funny, funny, funny game, I would say M\u00f4me Plus: original, which is more than very rare in recent times. \"Power\" takes place during the last day of an election campaign. Everything is located in a district of Paris while a member of the world that is not specified in the Soft Doc must make a closing speech. The game is played for two or alone. In case you play alone, you control a CRS battalion and your role is to physically intercept, ie to eliminate all the protesters who do their shit for Prevent the hon. Member's speech. If you play two, one of you will have to choose the Camp des Cops and the other one of the shitheads. The game is divided into two phases: the movement and the offensive . During the movement phase, you move your troops and you ask barriers and in the offensive phase, you type the resistance of the protesters. The fights are either to the tomato or the pavement or the molotov coktail.<br><br>If you do not miss the presentation that is well fucked and hyper nice, you will conclude like us that it is a well done, well done and original as I said it earlier. In short, it's power of the doors for Amstrad.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Bruno Masson", "publishers": "Loriciel", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161190"}
