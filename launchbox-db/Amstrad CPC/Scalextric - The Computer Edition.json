{"name": "Scalextric: The Computer Edition", "overview": "Scalextric is a brand of slot cars and Hornby slot car racing system sets which first appeared in the late 1950s. This game brought that to life in first person for the fans of the brand, though this was good enough that it was also released as Gran Prix later in Europe. European version / Radio Elettronica & Computer 1987/12 (Anno XVI Numero 10) / a.k.a. \"Grand Prix\". Released in North America as Slot Car Racer. The game is a simple two car, split screen racing game. Cars cannot come off the track but they do lose speed when driving along the track edge or when skidding in the chicanes. Cars can crash, a crash is when one car hits another from behind at a speed that's in excess of 20 mph. In a crash such as this the car that's behind automatically loses the race. However if the cars are level the race does allow one driver to move sideways to push the other player out of the way, either to make passing easier or to distract the other player. Each race can be for one or two players and when racing against the computer the player an select one of three difficulty levels to play against. Races can be from 1 to 99 laps long and the player has a choice of racing on one of the 2 supplied circuits or they can design their own. The C64 version of the game was released as Slot Car Racers in North America.", "platform": "Amstrad CPC", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Andrew Bradley", "publishers": "Leisure Genius", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/129245"}
