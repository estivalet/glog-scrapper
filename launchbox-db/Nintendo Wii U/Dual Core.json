{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dual Core", "overview": "A vibrant, futuristic, twin-stick style shooter. It's 2147 and the human colony on Europa has suffered a terrible fate. Rebooting after hibernation, two super-intelligent AI cores awake to find themselves installed within a couple of old security drones. Their attempts to uncover what occurred may end up becoming a lower priority than merely surviving... Lots of robots, lots of lasers, lots of aliens, lots of explosions! Retro arcade influences are front and center, but spiced up with a colorful modern style, a generous helping of sci-fi intrigue, and a dash of RPG ELEMENTS! Don't fight alone! Up to 4 players can battle together, but you'll always have your trusty (AI-controlled) robo-buddies by your side. In Story mode, battle through the labyrinth-like colony as you attempt to shed light on the calamity that has ocurred. Hone your skills in the arena-style Arcade mode. Battle wave after endless wave of the alien horde. Versus mode pits you against up to 3 friends.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii U", "release_date": "May 26, 2016", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "Gray Fin Studios", "publishers": "Gray Fin Studios", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/jU-EUE4PJZs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/94678-dual-core\n"}
