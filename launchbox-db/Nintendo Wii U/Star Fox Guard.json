{"altername_name": [], "name": "Star Fox Guard", "overview": "Star Fox Guard is a 3D tower defense game in which players must protect various bases, owned by Slippy Toad's uncle, Grippy, from oncoming attackers by monitoring security cameras. The television displays footage from all of the available security cameras while the Wii U GamePad features an overhead view of the base. To defend the base's core, players must watch the monitors carefully for any oncoming attackers and switch control to one of the available cameras in order to fire its weapon. Enemies are divided into two classes; Combat robots, which must all be defeated in order to progress, and Chaos robots, which hinder the player by tampering with the cameras, such as obscuring the view or showing fake footage. The game features 100 missions and an editor mode that allows players to edit the behavior of enemies in levels and share them online.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii U", "release_date": "April 22, 2016", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Nintendo EPD", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.55", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Fox_Guard", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=392lf7OzC7E", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40932-star-fox-guard\n"}
