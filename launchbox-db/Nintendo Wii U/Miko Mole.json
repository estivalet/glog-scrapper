The game contains 5 challenging environments with 40 levels per world for an impressive 200 total levels. Dig down, dig deep, and uncover precious gems for Miko, but be careful, as each level requires quick reflexes and cunning strategy to avoid the many obstacles, surprises, traps, and tricky puzzles, not to mention the many enemies such as bats, skunks, and rats.
