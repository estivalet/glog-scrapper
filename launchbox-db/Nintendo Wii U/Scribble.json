{"altername_name": [], "name": "Scribble", "overview": "Scribble is essentially an enhanced digital version of the classic word guessing game. On first glance, the title's offerings might not look like much - and feel all too similar - but upon closer inspection there is a barrage of content and game changers also referred to as \"mutators\" to keep the timeless formula feeling fresh. Scribble for the Wii U eShop caters to 2-8 players - making it an accessible party title for all ages and skill levels. Arguably, unlike a lot of traditional video games on the Wii U, the GamePad in Scribble is actually put to constructive use. The inclusion of the device never feels forced. One player draws on it, while other players use the television to guess what exactly the drawing is - it is indeed a modernised version of Pictionary. Once a round is finished the GamePad is passed on; it's that simple.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii U", "release_date": "December 15, 2016", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Bear Box Media", "publishers": "Bear Box Media", "genres": "Party", "max_players": "8", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/146982-scribble\n"}
