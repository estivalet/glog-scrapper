{"altername_name": [], "name": "Little Inferno", "overview": "Little Inferno is a puzzle video game developed by American independent game developer Tomorrow Corporation. The game was released for the Wii U on November 18, 2012 in North America and November 30, 2012 in Europe and Australasia. Microsoft Windows, iOS, OS X, Linux and Android versions followed throughout 2013. A Nintendo Switch version was released on March 16, 2017 in North America, and on March 23, 2017 in Europe and Australasia. Little Inferno is set in front of a brick fireplace, which the player uses to set various objects, such as toys, dolls, and electronics, on fire. The game encourages the player to burn any combination of objects to see how they react when lit ablaze, as most of the objects have unique properties. Little Inferno is classified as a sandbox game as it offers few traditional objectives to complete and has no states of failure. The game was designed as a satire of similarly themed video games in which the player dedicates long amounts of time to performing tasks considered to be unrewarding.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii U", "release_date": "November 18, 2012", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Tomorrow Corporation", "publishers": "Tomorrow Corporation", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Inferno", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/15586-little-inferno\n"}
