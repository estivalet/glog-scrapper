{"altername_name": [], "name": "Paparazzi", "overview": "Avoid the paparazzi. Catch the celebrity. It's a game of cat and mouse. Celebrity and paparazzi go head-to-head in this 2-player action/party game. The paparazzi must snap quick pictures of the celebrity, while the celebrity tries to escape to the limo with their dignity. Each level is a tug of war between the paparazzi's money and the celebrity's dignity. The game includes 6 unique levels, including a movie studio backot, a night club, and a high-class ball. The celebrity can play as one of 7 silly characters, anywhere from a mulleted movie star to a bear on a tricycle.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii U", "release_date": "February 17, 2015", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Pringo Dingo Games", "publishers": "Pringo Dingo Games", "genres": "", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQMWAjAfdtE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/84410-paparazzi\n"}
