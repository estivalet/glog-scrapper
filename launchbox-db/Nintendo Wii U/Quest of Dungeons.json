{"altername_name": [], "name": "Quest of Dungeons", "overview": "Quest of Dungeons is a turn-based dungeon crawler game, a rogue-like featuring a good old 16-bit retro artistic look. An evil Dark Lord has stolen all the light, so your mission is to enter his lair and defeat him. By playing as a Warrior, a Wizard, an Assassin or a Shaman, you have to traverse dungeons, defeat enemies and loot everything you can in order to survive. You can learn new skills in Tomes you find along the way and buy and sell items at shops. The entire game is procedural, so you won't find items and enemies in the same place each time you play.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii U", "release_date": "September 29, 2016", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "Upfall Studios", "publishers": "Upfall Studios", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quest_of_Dungeons", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0HGrk1b_UE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/163841-quest-of-dungeons\n"}
