{"altername_name": [], "name": "Infinity Runner", "overview": "The Infinity is the largest spaceship ever built by man-kind; flung into the void of space to secure humanity a new home amongst the stars. However, instead of discovering paradise, the inhabitants of The Infinity unlocked the door to a long forgotten nightmare. Deep inside this leviathan something terrible hunts, out of myth and legend the last werewolf stalks the ship. Infinity Runner centres on a prisoner desperately trying to escape the decaying ship and the clutches of the terror within. The player controls the protagonist, the prisoner, from a first-person perspective as he is challenged to escape from the gargantuan spaceship. Infinity Runner packs a lot into one super slick sci-fi action game and with it re-invents the running genre!", "platform": "Nintendo Wii U", "release_date": "March 24, 2016", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Wales Interactive", "publishers": "Wales Interactive", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X1ZtXjjjM0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/99707-infinity-runner\n"}
