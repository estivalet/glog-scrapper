{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mario vs. Donkey Kong: Tipping Stars", "overview": "Mario vs. Donkey Kong: Tipping Stars is a 2D puzzle game starring Mario and Donkey Kong. The monkey still likes to kidnap and the player has to complete levels helping Minis, wind-up toy versions of Mario and other characters, while solving puzzles. They walk by themselves and need to be guided to an exit. The player interferes by using touch on the GamePad to manipulate the environment. This is done by leading enemies away, covering traps, building or removing girders and adding or removing springs. Some levels have a character that needs to be freed and guided to safety. Other elements are escalators, conveyors with different directions, free-form building blocks, spikes to avoid, hammers to defeat Donkey Kongs blocking paths, toy Donkey Kongs with cannons heads, cursed Minis that need to be reclaimed etc. Levels are grouped per eight and each group introduces a new mechanic before mixing them up.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii U", "release_date": "March 5, 2015", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Nintendo SPD", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.94", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_vs._Donkey_Kong:_Tipping_Stars", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iR3A_3GVcXc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/26113-mario-vs-donkey-kong-tipping-stars\n"}
