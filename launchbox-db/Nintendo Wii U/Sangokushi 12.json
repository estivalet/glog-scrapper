{"altername_name": ["Romance of the Three Kingdoms 12"], "name": "Sangokushi 12", "overview": "Romance of the Three Kingdoms 12, also known as Sangokushi 12 (\u4e09\u570b\u5fd712), is the 12th installment in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms (Sangokushi) strategy game series by Koei. Unite chaotic China via Sangokushi. By using the online facilities, the battles and the simulations becomes more complex than ever. In this warring era, a fully equipped leader with the right amount of skills and ambition can develop their country and take over other people's territories. The game is split into three linked parts. You have to run a country, build facilities and develop skills. The skills can be military based, politics based or fundamental. You have to balance everything. Skills can be developed as you recruit people to join your camp. To keep your people working for you, you have to dish out punishments and rewards deftly. Sangokushi 12 has had a mixed to poor review ever since it was launched in 2012. Complaints include the lack of naval warfare, lack of unit types, and the overall gameplay. Though overall cities have been replaced by detailed maps with buildings you can place, the elaborate 3D duels throughout Sangokushi 11 have been downgraded to a video. The game is released in Japanese and Traditional Chinese. Additional scenarios can be unlocked throughout the game.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii U", "release_date": "December 13, 2012", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Koei", "publishers": "Koei Tecmo Games", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_of_the_Three_Kingdoms_12", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/15906-sangokushi-12\n"}
