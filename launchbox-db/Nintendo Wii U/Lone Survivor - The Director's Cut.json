{"altername_name": [], "name": "Lone Survivor: The Director's Cut", "overview": "In this psychological survival adventure, the masked protagonist must escape from a city ravaged by disease, by any means necessary. Starving and exhausted, he has begun to question how much of what he sees is even real. Lone Survivor: The Director's Cut is a new kind of adventure where the choice of how to survive is up to you. Sneak through without firing a single shot, or kill everything in your path. Eat and sleep well, or resort to drugs to keep going. Search for survivors, or try to escape the city alone. Look after your mental health, or descend into madness. Lone Survivor is a game where your choices genuinely matter. This extended edition of Jasper Byrne's horror masterpiece expands Lone Survivor's deep story with hundreds of tiny new details, more locations, more dialogue, more side quests, more craftable items, and even two completely new endings. Lone Survivor: The Director's Cut really is the ultimate version of this acclaimed game.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii U", "release_date": "September 24, 2013", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "superflat games", "publishers": "Curve Digital Publishing", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "0.75", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lone_Survivor_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGmrqNJixfo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/112823-lone-survivor-the-directors-cut\n"}
