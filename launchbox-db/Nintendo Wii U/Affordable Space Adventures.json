{"altername_name": [], "name": "Affordable Space Adventures", "overview": "Affordable Space Adventures is a 2D adventure game in which the player takes control of a spaceship named Small Craft, provided by the in-game fictional company of Uexplore. The game is split into several levels in which players have to control the Small Craft from the entrance of the level until the exit. To do so, players must use a variety of systems via the touch-screen on the Wii U Gamepad, such as switching from a fuel engine to an electrical engine, changing the thrust level and changing the landing gears, among others. In each level, players will encounter a series of obstacles, some of them environmental, some other being enemies that players have to find a way to sneak around from by tweaking the ship's systems to go through undetected. Players can always look at the Small Craft's output meters on the Wii U Gamepad's screen to see how much heat, electricity and sound they are producing, as well as which of the ship's systems are causing it, in order to reduce them and go past the enemies. Some enemies will also react to the ship's presence and will have to be scared away by pointing the ship's flashlight at them.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii U", "release_date": "April 9, 2015", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "KnapNok Games", "publishers": "KnapNok Games", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordable_Space_Adventures", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/65623-affordable-space-adventures\n"}
