{"altername_name": [], "name": "A Drawing's Journey", "overview": "Did you know that every drawing we make can come to life in the World of Drawings? A resident of this world contacts you because he needs your help! To convince you to help him, he offers to tell you his misadventures. With him, you'll go from one sheet of paper to another, each with a hand-drawn background. Pencil, pastel, painting, detailed or simplistic every place visited is unique! Talk to other drawings, and pick up and use objects to advance your journey. Some dangers may also prove useful: ink stains, torn sheets... Perform all actions with simple controls: just point at elements on the screen with the Wii Remote and press a single button to interact. So go on A Drawing's Journey!", "platform": "Nintendo Wii U", "release_date": "June 1, 2017", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "M. R. Games", "publishers": "M. R.
