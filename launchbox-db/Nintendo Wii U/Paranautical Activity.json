{"altername_name": [], "name": "Paranautical Activity", "overview": "Paranautical Activity is a first-person shooter game which uses elements of the roguelike genre. It uses a retro graphical style, with all objects and room architecture made of large cuboid voxels. The game takes place in randomly generated levels, where the player fights their way through a series of rooms. In each room the player must kill all enemies (such as flying skulls, giant spiders, ninjas etc.) to open the door to the next chamber. The final room contains a boss monster. Killing the boss rewards the player with an upgrade and allows him to access the next, more dangerous level. At the beginning of the game the player can choose one of the five classes, each with a different health, speed and starting equipment. The game uses a permanent death mechanic, similar to roguelikes; dying at any point forces the player to lose all game progress. There are a number of power-ups available, which can be both found dropped by bosses, and bought in special shop rooms where gold dropped by dead enemies can be exchanged for items. Effects of the power-ups include increased weapon damage, attracting money, the ability to double-jump, the necessity to use health instead of gold to pay in shops, and more.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii U", "release_date": "April 14, 2016", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Code Avarice", "publishers": "Digerati", "genres": "Horror", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranautical_Activity", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/163832-paranautical-activity\n"}
