{"altername_name": [], "name": "Toki Tori 2+", "overview": "Toki Tori 2 is the fourth main game in the series and just like the previous titles it is a puzzle platformer. There are two major differences compared to the previous games. Toki Tori, the yellow chicken, no longer has items at its disposal to solve puzzles. In addition, the sets of independent levels have been replaced with a large world connected through teleporters. Rather than acting like separate areas, the player can move between them in an unrestricted way once they have been discovered on the overhead map and the level design borrows from the metroidvania genre with different paths where areas need to be revisited. There is also no longer a single goal per level, but larger goals scattered through the world.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii U", "release_date": "March 31, 2013", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Two Tribes Publishing", "publishers": "Two Tribes Publishing", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toki_Tori_2", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/15589-toki-tori-2\n"}
