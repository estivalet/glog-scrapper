{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Swapper", "overview": "What if somebody knew your mind better than you did? The Swapper is an award-winning, narrative driven puzzle game set in the furthest reaches of space. The Swapper takes place in an isolated and atmospheric sci-fi world. Players wield an experimental device which allows them to create clones of themselves, swapping their entire consciousness into new bodies to overcome the challenges of the environment. Fiendishly designed puzzles with equally clever solutions that are never more than a few steps away. The art in The Swapper is constructed using clay models and everyday materials, which combine to create truly unique visuals in a detailed and atmospheric environment. A powerful and thoughtful story, told through the game's environment with narrative design from Tom Jubert, the writer behind hits including Driver: San Francisco and Faster Than Light.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii U", "release_date": "November 6, 2014", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "Plaything", "publishers": "Curve Digital Publishing", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.75", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Swapper", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjWFXHYtAWI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/84367-the-swapper\n"}
