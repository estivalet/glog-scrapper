{"altername_name": [], "name": "Adventures of Pip", "overview": "Adventures of Pip revitalizes the classic side-scrolling action platform genre. Pip -- the ultimate digital underdog \u2013 is a lowly single pixel in a 32-bit world who proves that you can\u2019t judge a hero by the fidelity of his shaders. During the game, Pip gains the ability to evolve and grow by absorbing pixels from his fallen foes. Those same pixels can then be used to blast through environment puzzles and enemies, devolving Pip back to a single pixel. Players will explore five stylized worlds and experience up to 10 hours of epic adventure saving Pip\u2019s village from the evil Queen DeRezzia.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii U", "release_date": "June 4, 2015", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "TicToc Games", "publishers": "TicToc Games", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventures_of_Pip", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/99694-adventures-of-pip\n"}
