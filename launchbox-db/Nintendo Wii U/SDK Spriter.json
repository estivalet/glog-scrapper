{"altername_name": [], "name": "SDK Spriter", "overview": "SDK Spriter is an all-in-one studio for creating retro video game assets, including character sprite sheets, tile sets, maps, and full levels. The final assets can be exported to Miiverse\u2122 or SDKSpriter.com. Sprite sheets are comprised of 64x64 pixel art characters that have eight frames of animation for each compass direction. The resulting sprite sheet is a PNG image. Tiles sets are comprised of 64x64 tile pixel art that is assembled into a 16x16 grid. The resulting tile set is a PNG image. Maps are 256x256 grids of tiles that reference an existing tile set. Levels are a combination of layered maps, a player sprite, and multiple non-player sprites. Levels come in three forms: Overworld, Platformer, and Terrain. Each level can be entered on Edit Mode or Play Mode. In Edit Mode, the player sets up the placement of layers and locations of sprites. In Play Mode, the levels follow standard mechanisms for physics and collision-detection.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii U", "release_date": "December 15, 2016", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "HullBreach Studios", "publishers": "HullBreach Studios", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xv04asI-R2E", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165693-sdk-spriter\n"}
