{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hold Your Fire: A Game About Responsibility", "overview": "Save the galaxy, be responsible, or die! Within each of us are a number of expectations about the responsible way to save the galaxy. HOLD YOUR FIRE: A GAME ABOUT RESPONSIBILITY seeks to exploit your assumptions about what it takes to be a video game hero and show how they are lacking. Will you play this game like you play other arcade shooters? Then that will likely lead to your demise. That stray bullet you shoot out of your cannon? It could lead to the loss of an innocent life and thus your own life! Play carefully and think carefully as you partake on this intergalactic adventure. This game features a single player arcade-style shooter where you try to topple the high score and a death counter so that you can keep track of the ways you die if you enjoy pain and defeat! Perhaps by playing this game you will become a responsible digital space hero!", "platform": "Nintendo Wii U", "release_date": "September 24, 2015", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "Alkterios Games", "publishers": "Alkterios Games", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/116177-hold-your-fire-a-game-about-responsibility\n"}
