{"altername_name": [], "name": "Toki Tori", "overview": "Toki Tori is the first of three Two Tribes classics to arrive on Wii U eShop. Next up will be 3D puzzler RUSH and retro platformer EDGE. While the classic gameplay has remained intact, Toki Tori has been adapted to make use of the Wii U Gamepad, allowing for off-TV play and optional touch controls. The gameplay in Toki Tori is a blend of two genres. While it looks like a platform game, it's a puzzle game at heart. To progress through the game, the player must pick up each egg in a level using a set number of tools. Players will have to look and plan ahead carefully while using items such as the Telewarp, Freeze-o-Matic and InstantRock. Additional tools are gradually introduced as the player progresses through the game's 80+ levels covering five unique worlds. Off-TV gameplay supported Both touch screen and traditional controls A wide variety of items and weapons Over 80 levels spread over 5 worlds For all ages - accessible and hard levels available", "platform": "Nintendo Wii U", "release_date": "November 7, 2013", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Two Tribes Publishing", "publishers": "Two Tribes Publishing", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toki_Tori", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVW7BYGT0qk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/99730-toki-tori\n"}
