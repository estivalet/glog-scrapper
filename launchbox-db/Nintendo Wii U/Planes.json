{"altername_name": ["Disney Planes"], "name": "Planes", "overview": "Get over your fear of heights and take to the skies for a daring mid-air adventure that will test your pilot skills and your sense of humor. After a few flight lessons with Skipper, throttle forward over the world of Cars, just like Disney's hit movie Planes. Fly solo or fly with a wingman to complete flight objectives, or challenge each other to an Air Rally race or a Balloon Pop challenge. And if you want to stretch your wings, get airborne with a leisurely Free Flight. Just don't look down!", "platform": "Nintendo Wii U", "release_date": "August 16, 2013", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Disney Interactive Studios", "publishers": "Disney Interactive Studios", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/87418-planes\n"}
