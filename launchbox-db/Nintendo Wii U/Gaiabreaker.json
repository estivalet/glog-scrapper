{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gaiabreaker", "overview": "Take to the skies and protect Earth from a previously unknown threat in this fast-paced shooter! In this scrolling shooter, take control of a hi-tech gunship and blast your way through six different stages to protect Earth from an invading menace. Your ship is armed with standard guns, as well as a powerful homing laser. Your guns can fire bullets directly ahead, damaging any enemies they collide with. By using your homing laser, you can lock on to up to four enemies at a time. When a green target appears, fire the laser and it will pursue the targeted enemies and bring them down! Connect to Miiverse to interact with other players. On completing a stage, a Miiverse posting form will be displayed, allowing you to post your comments for others to see. Your play data will also be contained in any post you make. When the viewing of Miiverse content is enabled, other users' data will also be displayed in game. You can see their scores and where they were defeated. Try to beat them all and be the very best!
