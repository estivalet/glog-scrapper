{"altername_name": [], "name": "Asdivine Hearts", "overview": "One year ago, the world of Asdivine was enveloped by a brilliant flash of light. Since that time, the influence of shadow has only continued to grow ever more powerful across the face of the land. Although the event itself was undoubtedly connected with the heavens, few people seem to have realized the far-reaching implications of what transpired. Now turning to the present, a surprising revelation awaits a young man by the name of Zack and his childhood friend, Stella, in the capital from a chubby cat claiming to be none other than the Light Deity and declaring the world to be on the verge of destruction... Asdivine Hearts boasts of groundbreaking visual quality, plenty of subquests, a battle arena, treasure to dig for, and an enemy guide to complete. By taking puzzle piece-like jewels and setting them in a box known as a rubix, players are able to customize characters! How far can you level and how many millions of damage can you dish out? All these challenges await you and more!", "platform": "Nintendo Wii U", "release_date": "April 14, 2016", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "EXE-CREATE", "publishers": "Kemco", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhF_H2Kvm0I", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/81845-asdivine-hearts\n"}
