{"altername_name": [], "name": "Spheroids", "overview": "Spheroids is a 2D sidescroller that mixes mechanics from classic platformers such as Super Mario Bros or Umihara Kawase with 'combat' sections inspired in Pang! (or Buster Brothers), within a comical science-fiction setting inspired by films and series such as Futurama, Rick & Morty, Ghostbusters, Back to the Future or Spaceballs. In Spheroids you take control of Lucas, a jumpy Canadian boy who sets out on an adventure with his crazy scientist companion Otto after it's discovered that the government has been hiding alternative universes from the cubic world they live in. Unfortunately, these alternative universes contain spheres that wish to turn everything round, so it's up to Lucas to save the world from these dangerous aliens: the Spheroids. Throughout Spheroids 32 levels, you'll encounter many different environments, with multiple hazards to avoid and enemies to destroy. Items such as the Modified-Drilling-Hook Otto lends Lucas will help you traverse the environment with ease, with many more to find throughout.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii U", "release_date": "February 10, 2017", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Eclipse Games", "publishers": "Eclipse Games", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdvaXuIP54c", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/112663-spheroids\n"}
