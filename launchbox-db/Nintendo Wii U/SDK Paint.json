{"altername_name": [], "name": "SDK Paint", "overview": "SDK Paint takes a unique approach to Wii U\u2122 artwork creation, by stacking 5 layers onto the artwork canvas. Each layer can independently be utilized to create the next masterpiece. By combining the artistic modes (Normal Paint, Noisy Paint, Smudge, and Spraycan), the numerous filters (Blur, Negate, Lighten, Darken, etc.), the shaders (Pattern Fill, Flood Fill, Texture, etc.), and the tools (Gridlines, Stencils, Drag, Swap, etc.), possibilities of what the stylus can paint onto the canvas are endless. Oops, a mistake... 10 levels of Undo will help with that! The artwork need fine precision? Just zoom the canvas! A large color palette, with dragging support, lets artists easily choose exactly the color desired, and a Dropper tool makes identifying previous colors a simple task. The features don't just end with painting, either! How does the artwork look on a wall? Explore the retro 3D Galleries to see all 18 paintings framed on the walls. Is the artwork ready show off? Jump into the Sharing area and prepare it for either 2D or anaglyph 3D (special glasses required) posting of screenshots to Miiverse.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii U", "release_date": "November 6, 2014", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "HullBreach Studios", "publishers": "HullBreach Studios", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIiJPavxlUU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165691-sdk-paint\n"}
