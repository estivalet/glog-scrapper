Rayman Legends takes full advantage of the Wii U controller to bring players innovative multiplayer interactions that go beyond those found in traditional platform games. Players can use the Wii U controller's touch screen to take out enemies or clear paths and use the gyroscope technology to manipulate and rotate platforms on the TV screen. The Wii U controller also allows players to continue the adventure of Rayman and his friends on the controller's screen even while the television is off.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii U", "release_date": "September 1, 2013", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Ubisoft", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.41", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayman_Legends", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVtkqypEBw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/11800-rayman-legends\n"}
