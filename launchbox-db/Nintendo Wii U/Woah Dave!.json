{"altername_name": [], "name": "Woah Dave!", "overview": "Woah Dave! focuses around Dave Lonuts and his survival during an alien invasion. Players will need to jump around the various platforms to avoid the aliens. Hurling eggs, skull bombs and explosive WOAH blocks aid in killing the aliens. Killed aliens drop pennies which can be collected to increase the player's score. Occasionally, alien ships appear on screen. Destroying those causes all enemies and alien eggs to explode. There is also another mode called Bonkers Mode that contains more aliens, lava and chances to get killed. The PlayStation 4, Wii U and Windows versions include a local 2 player competitive mode.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii U", "release_date": "August 20, 2015", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Choice Provisions", "publishers": "Choice Provisions", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woah_Dave!", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXHGyIUMGgA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/118080-woah-dave\n"}
