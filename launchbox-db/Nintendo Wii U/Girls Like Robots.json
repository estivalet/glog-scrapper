{"altername_name": [], "name": "Girls Like Robots", "overview": "Break hearts. Eat pie. Fight aliens. Everybody wants to sit by their friends. Arrange for happiness. Ridiculous seating arrangement puzzles, wrapped in an epic tale of love and danger, topped off with an authentic old-time stringband soundtrack! Their faces are the playing pieces. The rules are their emotions. Put every one next to their friends. Customize every face in the game with dozens of swappable parts. Better yet: Use the Wii U\u2122 GamePad's camera to capture the varied emotions of your friends and family (or enemies or those towards which you feel indifferent). Did we mention competitive pass-and-play local multiplayer?! It's like playing chess but every piece is a picture of you sticking your tongue out. But you can't please everybody all the time. Sometimes you gotta break hearts to save the day. And the day definitely needs saving: Volcanoes, exploding chickens, planetary invasion and a boy who just wants to dance with a girl.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii U", "release_date": "November 12, 2015", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/84338-girls-like-robots\n"}
