{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tetrobot & Co.", "overview": "Tetrobot and Co. is a pure puzzle game. Absorb blocks of matter and throw them around to fix everything! Tetrobot is the world's most popular and reliable robot, but he's not perfect. That's why I, Maya, have built him a microscopic little brother, Psychobot. Help me guide Psy through Tetrobot's cogs and circuits: by swallowing blocks of matter and spitting them out, we can repair anything. Learn how pipes, lasers, fans and other electronic devices work, learn how to alter the chemical properties of slime, and collect all the memory blocks that you find on the way. The owners of damaged Tetrobots all around the world rely on us because we are the only people who can repair their precious robots.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii U", "release_date": "October 30, 2014", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Swing Swing Submarine", "publishers": "Neko Entertainment", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9RB1w8HiEI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/84366-tetrobot-co\n"}
