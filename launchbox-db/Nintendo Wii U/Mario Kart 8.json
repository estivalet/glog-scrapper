{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mario Kart 8", "overview": "The gameplay maintains the traditional elements of previous Mario Kart games, mostly from the two recent installments on the Wii and 3DS respectively. Karts, which feature similar designs from Mario Kart 7, can be customized once again, alongside the returning bikes, which handle similar to the karts now and can only perform a wheelie via a boost, and the newly introduced buggies, as well as, according to an interview, more customization options that have yet to be revealed. The hang-glider and underwater mechanics also return, as well as Coins, with the player being able to collect up to ten in one race as in Mario Kart 7. Like Mario Kart Wii, twelve racers are present in normal races. The newest feature for the series is anti-gravitational segments, that not only allow for more dynamic track design, but also for racers to drive across walls and ceilings. When in anti-gravity, if a racer bumps into another racer, the kart spins rather than just bumping and both racers receive a speed boost. These tracks have been described as more narrow when compared to previous Mario Kart tracks, specifically those from Mario Kart Wii. For the fifth time in the series, courses from previous Mario Kart games will be included, and both the game's anti-gravity mechanic, as well as Mario Kart 7 's \"air, land, and sea\" mechanic will be incorporated into these retro courses, much like the retro courses in Mario Kart 7.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii U", "release_date": "May 30, 2014", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Nintendo", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.66", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Kart_8", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mU7tXqYplA8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/16908-mario-kart-8\n"}
