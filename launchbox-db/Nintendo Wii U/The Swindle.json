{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Swindle", "overview": "The Swindle is a crime caper about breaking into buildings, hacking, stealing and getting away fast. The Swindle is a steampunk cybercrime caper about breaking into buildings, hacking their systems, stealing all their cash, and quickly running away again before the police show up. London, 1849. Scotland Yard will soon activate its breakthrough surveillance technology, \"The Devil's Basilisk\". Its surveillance capabilities will be total and your career as a master thief will be over. Steal it, before that can happen. From the safety of your rickety airship, you can modify your thief with new skills, tools, and all manner of technological horrors to tackle the richest and most secure buildings in London. All the buildings you'll be robbing are randomly-generated, so you'll never get the same level twice. Have you got what it takes to pull off The Swindle?", "platform": "Nintendo Wii U", "release_date": "September 10, 2015", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "Size Five Games", "publishers": "Curve Digital Publishing", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Swindle_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgDCkP_GebY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/84402-the-swindle\n"}
