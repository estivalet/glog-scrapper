As the captain you will board, loot and shoot your way through enemy spaceships. Overcome the challenges of the vast frontier by upgrading your recruits with unique abilities, weapons - and even stylish hats! Strategy focused on skill rather than chance, procedurally generated levels and 15-20 hours of playtime. Followed by New Game+ Kind to newcomers, deep and challenging for veterans.
