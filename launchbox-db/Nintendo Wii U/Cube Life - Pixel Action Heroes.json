{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cube Life: Pixel Action Heroes", "overview": "Cube Life: Pixel Action Heroes breaks away from the gameplay introduced in Cube Life: Island Survival. Rather than obtaining resources, building forts and crafting weapons, the game focuses largely on Run and Gun FPS action. Players take on the role of a Pixel Action Hero of their choice (you can also create your own Hero) and charge gun-first into several action-packed missions and non-stop zombie modes. Play as an iconic action hero from the 80s in a fully destructible block-building world. Become a FPS level designer! Create your own map, share with friends, let them try it out, and get their feedback.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii U", "release_date": "March 30, 2017", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Cypronia", "publishers": "Cypronia", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147492-cube-life-pixel-action-heroes\n"}
