{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Deer God", "overview": "The Deer God is an indie platformer originally funded through a Kickstarter campaign. The game starts with the player being a hunter. As a deer hunter, he gets attacked by wolfs and dies. Mother nature wants the hunter to learn his lesson, and thus the deer hunter reincarnates as a deer himself. At this point the player can start controlling the character. The game features a 2D platforming world in which the player encounters food sources, obstacles, enemies, and NPC's. Surviving for a long time lets the player grow to an elder deer. The game contains a lot of NPC's which are friendly to the player. These can nonetheless be killed, but it'll affect the in-game moral system, giving bad points for killing innocents and good points for enemies. Enemies in the game include ex-fellow deer hunters and foxes. Several bosses are an alternation to the normally encountered enemies, including an eagle, snapping turtle, beaver, snake, and a toad. The world features big deer statues which can be used to upgrade the antlers of the deer.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii U", "release_date": "April 28, 2016", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Crescent Moon Games", "publishers": "Mobot Studios", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJbtLiRTJKw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/163885-the-deer-god\n"}
