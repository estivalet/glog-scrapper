Players can perform a double jump as well as perform attacks to defeat enemies or gain extra reach whilst jumping. The background of each level constantly shifts between a cycle of colors, causing obstacles of the same color as the background, such as blockades and spikes, to disappear. By using the Wii Remote's connectivity to utitlise the Wii Nunchuk or Wii Classic Controllers in addition to itself, the game is capable of supporting up to nine players.[5] The game will support many features such as achievements, time trials, a special mode called \"Master the Bowhemoth\", and many more. There is also character customization, as well as other modes that are not racing-focused, such as \"King of the Hill\" and \"Arena\".", "platform": "Nintendo Wii U", "release_date": "August 27, 2015", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "13AM", "publishers": "13AM", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "9", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runbow", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV2BZl17gMI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/65619-runbow\n"}
