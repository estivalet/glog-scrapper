{"altername_name": [], "name": "GravBlocks+", "overview": "Reinventing the Match-3 Puzzle Game. Puzzle challenges with gravity twists! GravBlocks+ is a new and different take on the traditional match-three style puzzle game. Rather than building combos the old fashioned way, the gameplay is designed around strategic planning and changing gravity and earn Score Multipliers. However, it's not as easy as it sounds! The walls are filled with Destruction Hazards, and dropping blocks into those Hazards instantly resets the Score Multiplier. Using a Wild Block closes the Hazards making gravity changes safer, but players need to plan well for these moments!", "platform": "Nintendo Wii U", "release_date": "February 26, 2015", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "From Nothing Game Studios", "publishers": "From Nothing Game Studios", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147677-gravblocks\n"}
