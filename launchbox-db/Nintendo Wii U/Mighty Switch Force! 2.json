{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mighty Switch Force! 2", "overview": "Patricia Wagon returns, but this time as a firefighter. Tangent City is on fire, and it's up to Officer Wagon and Corporal Gendarmor to save the day. Gameplay-wise, the game is very similar to the original Mighty Switch Force!, a puzzle-platformer-shooter where the player must maneuver through the level, shooting down enemies and switching blocks in and out of the level. But this time, Patty Wagon's armed with a fire hose and must rescue the now reformed Hooligan Sisters instead of arresting them, along with putting out fires. Fire is everywhere, not only making it time consuming to put it out, but potentially hurting Officer Wagon. New gameplay mechanics are new types of blocks, such as mud blocks that can be dissolved with water and pipe blocks that redirect the water stream, and the mission of seeking out the lost USBs (Ugly Secret Babies) hidden in each level. As in the first game, each incident has a target clear time.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii U", "release_date": "October 17, 2013", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "WayForward Technologies", "publishers": "WayForward Technologies", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.45", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mighty_Switch_Force!_2", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/81380-mighty-switch-force-2\n"}
