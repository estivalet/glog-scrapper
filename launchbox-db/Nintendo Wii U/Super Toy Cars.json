{"altername_name": [], "name": "Super Toy Cars", "overview": "Super Toy Cars is a tabletop arcade combat racing game featuring fast and cool looking cars, impressive tracks made of everyday objects and a bunch of power-ups that will let you destroy your opposition. Collect all cars and upgrades to keep up with competition while you progress in career mode or have a quick race either against AI opponents or against friends. You can play up to 4 players locally. There are 16 different cars in the game each one with its unique handling model. You can experiment with them and play the ones that best suite your driving style and the different situations you'll find in our 12 tracks. Oh, and maybe you'll want to use different cars depending on which type of event you're playing, because we have 48 events in career mode, but not all of them are races! Super Toy Cars is big and with lots of options for you to tinker and play with, but most importantly this game has been carefully crafted to be fun play and fun to race, either alone or with friends.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii U", "release_date": "July 24, 2014", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Eclipse Games", "publishers": "Eclipse Games", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jD3GuGao3qU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/84375-super-toy-cars\n"}
