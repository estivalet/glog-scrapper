It was developed in conjunction with Nintendo. Though the mechanics of Minecraft remain the same in the pack, everything has been visually changed to match the aesthetics of the Mario franchise, which includes different skins for the player and every block, item, and mob. There is also a premade world containing several Mario landmarks and multiple enemy gauntlets and jumping challenges; additionally, the Mash-up comes with its own soundtrack comprising almost entirely of music from Super Mario 64.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii U", "release_date": "May 17, 2016", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "4J Studios", "publishers": "Mojang", "genres": "Sandbox", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.08", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/88176-minecraft-super-mario-edition\n"}
