{"altername_name": [], "name": "Star Castle", "overview": "Homebrew remake of the classic arcade game. In this game you find yourself in a small ship opposed against a Star Castle. This fortress is a powerful turret placed behind three circular protective force fields. You will have to puncture through the force fields and make that demanding shot for the center. Each of the forcefields is made up of eight segments, each such segments take two hits to destroy. Of course it's not quite that easy... First small sparks will come out of the center trying to hit you. The turret in the center can also launch a very fast, and very accurate, laser at you. On top of that if you destroy a entire circular layer of force field it will regenerate along with another layer! This makes it impossible for you to stay in the same spot, as the layers rotate in opposite directions you will inevitable destroy one before breaching and destroying the center. Being hit by anything will cause the loss of one of your four lives, however if you hit the Forcefields you'll only bounce off.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "2012", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "D.
