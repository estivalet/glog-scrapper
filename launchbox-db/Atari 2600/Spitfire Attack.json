{"altername_name": [], "name": "Spitfire Attack", "overview": "Shooting game. The game was sold with the Flight Commander controller. In this game, you are an American fighter pilot. Your mission is to shoot down enemy planes, shoot enemy ammo dumps (they look like little black houses) and enemy anti-aircraft guns (they kinda look like sundials). If you fly down too long, you will get a low altitude warning. If you don't correct, you will crash. You can also be shot down by anti-aircraft guns and enemy planes. Push left and right to go those directions but push up to go down and down to go up. Push the fire button to fire machine guns.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Milton Bradley", "publishers": "Milton Bradley", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21567\n"}
