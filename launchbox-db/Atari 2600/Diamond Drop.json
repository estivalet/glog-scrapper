{"altername_name": [], "name": "Diamond Drop", "overview": "Diamond Drop is a small 4k game that is loosely based on the iOS game 'Duet'. You have two Diamonds at the bottom of the screen that will rotate in a circle in either direction along a diamond shaped path. Barriers will fall from the top of the screen in a random pattern and you must avoid them by circling around them. Every barrier you pass will score you a point. The game will slowly get faster up to it's maximum speed after you've passed 20 barriers. You can press down on the joystick to move the barriers down the screen faster. That's useful if you've got yourself positioned correctly and just want to quickly bypass the barrier. You are also armed with 6 bombs per game (indicated on the status bar) which will erase an barrier on the screen. That's useful if it looks like you're not going to be able to easily pass it. Your high score will be saved on the title screen.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "2015", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "", "developers": "Atarius Maximus", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/124412\n"}
