{"altername_name": ["Der Hungrige Panda"], "name": "Panda Chase", "overview": "Panda Chase is a strange game where, controlling a panda, you must go through the different levels of the game looking for bamboo to recover its energy, which is lost every second. When the game starts, the panda will be in an open area, with several places to explore. As soon as you enter somewhere, you will appear in a new environment, be it a cave, forest or open field. Your objective will be to go through the obstacles and dodge the enemies to get your bamboo. When picking up a bamboo, the player will recover his energy and receive points. If you run out of points or lose your three lives, the game will be over. Apparently Panda Chase is not a prototype, the game was finished and marketed, which does not justify the graphics and various bugs that happen in the game.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Home Vision", "publishers": "Home Vision", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOjkddR_QU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78403\n"}
