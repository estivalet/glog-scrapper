{"altername_name": [], "name": "X-Man", "overview": "X-Man is a pornographic video game made for the Atari 2600 by Universal Gamex, programmed by Alan Roberts and H. K. Poon. This game was released in 1983. This game has nothing to do with the similarly named Marvel's comic book series entitled X-Men. It is the only title made by Universal Gamex. It had faced protest from women\u2019s groups when it was first released, and most retailers declined to carry it - or if they did, buyers had to be 18 years old to purchase the game, or it was kept under-the-counter. It could also be purchased via mail order, and an ad inviting such purchases appeared in at least one gaming magazine a full-page ad can be found in the July 1983 issue of Videogaming Illustrated. Consequently, as of 2014, it is very hard to find. However, it is easier to find this game in PAL format and rarer in NTSC. There have been reports that there are between twenty and forty-five cartridges in existence.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Alan Roberts", "publishers": "Universal Gamex", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.41", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Man_(Atari_2600_video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/58536\n"}
