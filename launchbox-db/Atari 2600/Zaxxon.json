Your ship zooms over an alien asteroid, and dives down to attack the enemy's installations. Your ship must avoid hazardous walls, enemy fire, and other unforeseen dangers! Can you survive and score? Unlike the arcade versions (and other home ports) the 2600 version is a top-down vertically scrolling game, rather than the diagonal isometric perspective used in the original arcade version.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Coleco Industries", "publishers": "Coleco Industries", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.41", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaxxon", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAejrDtlBE4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/14577\n"}
