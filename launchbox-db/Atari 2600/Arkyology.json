{"altername_name": [], "name": "Arkyology", "overview": "Developed by Enter-Tech Ltd. for the Christian music company Sparrow Records. Although this game was finished, it was never officially released but was released for the community by the original programmer Paul Walters in 2018. Arkyology is set on Noah's Ark and sees the player control 'Noah' with the goal being to feed the animals on the Ark. The game shows three floors separated by ladders that contained animal stalls. Each 'day' has two parts. The first sees you run around and open all of the animal stalls, the second involves you 'feeding' each of the animals. Of course, there are obstacles like flying birds, scuttling spiders and alligators patrolling the floors. The game speeds up as the difficulty increases .", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Enter-Tech, Ltd.", "publishers": "Sparrow Home Computer Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE6fRPVFnC4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/167315\n"}
