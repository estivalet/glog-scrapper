{"altername_name": [], "name": "Klax", "overview": "Klax features a conveyor belt at the top of the screen. It constantly rolls toward the playing area, delivering a steady supply of blocks. The player controls a small device which sits at the interface between the conveyor belt and the playing area, and can be moved left and right to catch the blocks and either deposit them in the playing area or push them back up the conveyor belt. The device can hold up to five blocks. A block which is not caught and placed in the playing area or pushed back up the belt is considered a drop. The blocks are solid colours, but there is also a flashing block which can be used as a wildcard on any colour. According to AtariProtos.com, this was the last game released for the Atari 2600 by Atari. Although it was ported to the NTSC format, it was never released in that format. Making a big \u2018X\u2019 will warp you far ahead in the game. These secret warps are not mentioned in the game. Completing the game (wave 100) will show a celebratory screen with fireworks.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "December 1, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atari", "publishers": "Atari", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.61", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klax_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3ssXcSodzI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/5052\n"}
