{"altername_name": ["Breakaway IV", "Breakout: Breakaway IV"], "name": "Breakout", "overview": "In the game, a layer of bricks lines the top third of the screen. A ball travels across the screen, bouncing off the top and side walls of the screen. When a brick is hit, the ball bounces away and the brick is destroyed. The player loses a turn when the ball touches the bottom of the screen. To prevent this from happening, the player has a movable paddle to bounce the ball upward, keeping it in play.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1978", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Brad Stewart", "publishers": "Atari", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.48", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_(video_game)", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNeW98Xhq-I", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/5043\n"}
