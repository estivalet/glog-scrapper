{"altername_name": [], "name": "Barnstorming", "overview": "In Barnstorming, you are the pilot of a biplane. Your point of view is from the side as the screen scrolls by horizontally. Your goal is to fly through a set number of barns in the shortest amount of time possible. Several obstacles will appear in your way, including flocks of geese, windmills, and weather vanes. Crashing into any of these will cause you to lose speed which will increase your overall time. There are several difficulty levels included which will require that you fly through anywhere from 10 to 25 barns.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Steve Cartwright", "publishers": "Activision", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.57", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnstorming_(video_game)", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1omwJegOAH8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/7636\n"}
