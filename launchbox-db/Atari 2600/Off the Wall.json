{"altername_name": [], "name": "Off the Wall", "overview": "Off the Wall is a video game developed for the Atari 2600 video game console in 1989. It is essentially a clone of Breakout with a Chinese theme. It was developed by Axlon, a game development studio owned by Atari founder Nolan Bushnell. Players take control of the hero Kung Fu Lu, and the objective is smash through an evil wall to kill a dragon that has been tormenting villagers. In the game, Lu receives several power-ups to achieve his goal, and he must overcome a bat that stands in his way. Atari later released another Breakout clone into video arcades, also called Off the Wall. Off the Wall was made available on Microsoft's Game Room service for its Xbox 360 console and for Windows-based PCs on December 1, 2010. The game has an undocumented pause feature, by use of the TV Type switch. Flip it twice to turn on/off.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "John Vifian", "publishers": "Atari", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.38", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off_the_Wall_(Atari_2600)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dlz0-iAuM94", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/30151\n"}
