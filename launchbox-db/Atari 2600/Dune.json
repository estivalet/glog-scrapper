{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dune", "overview": "Based off the 1984 movie, Dune was to be an action/adventure game along the same lines the classic 2600 game Adventure. Dune was originally started by veteran programmers Bruce Poehlman and Gary Stark before they began working on the 5200 game \"The Last Starfighter\" (which also went unreleased). Unfortunately Gary and Bruce had only gone through the brainstorming process when work was stopped. However it appears that another programmer may have been assigned to pick up and continue work on Dune. Unfortunately only preliminary coding had been started before Jack Tramiel shut down 2600 game development and fired most of the staff.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atari", "publishers": "Unreleased Prototype", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXOtRSzBXVI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/82272\n"}
