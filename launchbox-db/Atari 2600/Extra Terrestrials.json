{"altername_name": [], "name": "Extra Terrestrials", "overview": "This maze game offers a two-player variation on the classic Pac-Man formula. One player controls an alien as the Pac-Man stand-in, eating as many dots as they can throughout the stage. Chasing them is the other player as a human who, like the ghosts, is trying to catch and destroy them. The long cart, the box and manual are (re)productions from 2011 with permission of programmer Herman Quast. Rarity Along with Birthday Mania, Red Sea Crossing, and Gamma- Atta\ufeffck, Extra Terrestrials is one of the rarest Atari 2600 games. Extra Terrestrials was released just in time for the crash of 1983. The few copies ever produced were sold to retailers door-to-door exclusively in Southern Ontario.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Herman Quast", "publishers": "Skill Screen Games", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRWuJgDMZjc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83246\n"}
