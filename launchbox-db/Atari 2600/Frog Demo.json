{"altername_name": [], "name": "Frog Demo", "overview": "This prototype was found in a box of EPROMs given to the Digital Press by Dr. John Bronstein, one of the co-founders of Commavid. This EPROM was simply labeled \"Frog\", and is really just a one-screen demo featuring a frog and some stationary moths. When the fire button is pressed, the frog will shoot out its tongue (looks suspiciously like the laser beam).", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "CommaVid", "publishers": "CommaVid", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM2u0JX71zQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/116888\n"}
