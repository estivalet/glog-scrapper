{"altername_name": [], "name": "Skate Boardin'", "overview": "One of the first skateboarding-based video games, you have five minutes to get from your front steps to the steps of the school. The player must locate and successfully negotiate thirty hidden tricks in the form of ramps and pipes within a time limit. To save time it is possible to skitch on the back of moving vehicles. The fire button makes the player jump, which is necessary for remounting the skateboard after falling off. Jumping can also be used to get past hurdles. Continuing to hold the fire button results in a crouch, needed for passing through pipes. Additional challenges include finding the most efficient route through the maze and avoiding various obstacles that slow the player down.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Absolute Entertainment", "publishers": "Absolute Entertainment", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.12", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skate_Boardin%27", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/28811\n"}
