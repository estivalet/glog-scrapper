{"altername_name": [], "name": "Swordquest: FireWorld", "overview": "Welcome to FireWorld. You may have already travelled through EarthWorld and succeeded in solving the EarthWorld puzzle. FireWorld is the second in a series of four worlds that you must pass through on your quest for the Sword of Ultimate Sorcery. You enter FireWorld as a mighty warrior. Your skill and courage will be tested with dangerous trials and obstacles. The object of the game is to solve the puzzle. The FireWorld puzzle is based on the Tree of Life, with ten rooms linked together by ten rooms with doorways. FireWorld has ten treasure chest rooms, some containing different magical objects. These objects will help you on your journey through FireWorld. Carrying particular objects will help you find clues. Before you can explore these rooms, you'll be called on to demonstrate certain skills, just as Torr and Tarra are tested in the FireWorld comic book. As a warrior, your skills are important to conquering FireWorld. To help you on your quest, you will be armed with the FireWorld comic book which contains additional clues. Some clues will come from a combination of both the comic book and the Game Program cartridge. These clues will refer back to the enclosed comic book and hint at the solution to the FireWorld puzzle. You have just leaped into the blazing flames of FireWorld - see if you can survive and triumph!", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "January 1, 1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atari", "publishers": "Atari", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.39", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21561\n"}
