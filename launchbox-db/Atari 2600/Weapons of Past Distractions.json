{"altername_name": [], "name": "Weapons of Past Distractions", "overview": "\"This song was a challenging labor of love, written for the Atari 2600 VCS, my first video game system. Early video game programmers worked intensely within constricting limitations to create compelling games that fueled the imagination. In my youth, I spent countless hours fighting enemies which existed more in the mind than were apparent in the pixels on the screen. This was a life lesson of sorts that I\u2019ve learned often translates to real life too. With \u2018Weapons of Past Distractions\u2019 I wanted to try to capture that feeling in song with a bombastic drum and bass track that pushed the limits of the Atari 2600. With the hardware limitations in mind, I composed the song on a keyboard and wrote the drum parts out on graph paper then translated it note for note in hexadecimal code. Then, using Paul Slocum\u2019s Sequencer Kit, I was able to assemble a working file that I could test out on the Z26 emulator. After some trial and error, and much tweaking, the finished song was sent to the good folks at AtariAge who assembled the cartridges for me from the finest stock.\"", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "July 9, 2012", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Thom Uliasz", "publishers": "NintendoAge", "genres": "Music", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://sounds.burnkit2600.com/album/weapons-of-past-distractions", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxH_GzHX9Y4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/145361\n"}
