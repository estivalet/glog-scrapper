{"altername_name": [], "name": "Private Eye", "overview": "You are the great French private eye Pierre Touche. Your job is to capture the criminal Henri Le Fiend and send him to jail. To do this, you will first need to find evidence against him and return the stolen property. During the game, you control Touche as he drive his car around the town looking for clues and the loot. As you drive around, various obstacles will be trying to stop you: questionable characters may appear and throw flower pots or daggers at you, pot holes may be found in the road, or assorted creatures may run in your path. From time to time, you will see questionable characters hiding in a window; if you jump up and catch them, you may find they are hiding an item you're looking for! If not, you will still get points for nabbing a questionable character and can move on to searching a new location. When you located an item, you need to find the proper building to return or verify the item after which you can move on to finding the next item. The game includes five different cases, each with a unique set of goals and of varying difficulty. Some of the goals you may need to complete are: find the stolen necklace and return it to the gem store, find the gun and verify it at the gun store, find the vase and return it to the museum, or find Le Fiend and book him at police headquarters. Each of the cases has a time limit; if you are unable to complete all of the tasks required by the case before time runs out, the game is over. Each case also takes place in a different part of the city, and the more difficult cases cover more city blocks so there will be a greater area to search! In addition to the various cases, several difficulty settings are included which control the speed of your car and how high you can jump.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Activision", "publishers": "Activision", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_Eye_(Atari_2600_video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMJpPMYDP0Y", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/13805\n"}
