{"altername_name": [], "name": "Entombed", "overview": "What started out as a nice little archaeological expedition has suddenly become a nightmarish fight for survival! A team of archaeologists is trapped in an underground maze of dark, winding tunnels. All around them, fearsome zombies are emerging from the crypts. The archaeologists' only hope of survival (apart from some very fast running) is an ancient device known as the 'make-break', which can be used to either create or destroy pieces of wall. In this increasingly frantic one or two-player arcade game, you'll need wits as well as dexterity. You'll have to think on the fly, plan strategically and race through the maze as fast as you can. Fail to keep up the pace and you're zombie fodder. Good luck! Trivia: Researchers going through the game code in the 2010s have been unable to figure out how the game's maze-generating algorithm managed to consistently generate playable mazes. The original coder says he got it from another programmer who wrote it while drunk.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Western Technologies Inc.", "publishers": "U.S. Games", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.12", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entombed_(Atari_2600)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB36XbNYL8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/17207\n"}
