{"altername_name": [], "name": "Climber 5", "overview": "Climber 5 is a port by Dennis Debro of an Atari 8-bit computer game that originally appeared in COMPUTE! magazine back in 1987. In Climber you play the role of a baseball player. The baseball has been hit to the upper rafters of a building under construction. Your job is to climb the ladders and retrieve the ball. Of course, there are obstacles along the way that you need to avoid or you lose a life and must start over at the bottom right corner. Once you successfully retrieve the ball, the level changes and becomes more difficult. You can view a screenshot from the original Atari 8-bit version (which you can see here) and can read the original COMPUTE! article here. AtariAge and Dennis Debro sponsored a Climber 5 Label Contest. The winning label created by Jason Dvorak adorns all copies of Climber 5 sold. You can purchase a copy of Climber 5, complete with a full-color, 16-page manual (which itself features a four page comic), in the AtariAge Store.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "2004", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dennis Debro", "publishers": "AtariAge", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.58", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYhpDkXRpAs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/46228\n"}
