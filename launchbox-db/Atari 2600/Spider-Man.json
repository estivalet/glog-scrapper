{"altername_name": [], "name": "Spider-Man", "overview": "The Green Goblin has set a super bomb at the top of a high voltage tower located on the top of a skyscaper! As Spider-Man, you need to scale the building and defuse the bomb. Use your web to climb the building, but be careful of Green Goblin's villians which appear in the windows trying to stop you. If your web line goes too close to a villain, it will be cut and Spider-Man will fall. If you're careful, you can swing back and forth to capture the villains for bonus points. When you reach the top of the building, it's time to climb up the high voltage tower which is booby trapped with bombs. The bomb can be defused or avoided to get to the top, but just make sure you aren't too close to one that explodes! Once you arrive at the top of the tower, Green Goblin himself will be protecting the super bomb he has planted there. If you can sneak past Green Goblin and defuse the super bomb, the level is complete and you then move on to the next, more challenging level.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "January 1, 1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Parker Brothers", "publishers": "Parker Brothers", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.94", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man_(1982_video_game)", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZzGaFiyezY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2803\n"}
