{"altername_name": [], "name": "Golf", "overview": "Golf features a nine hole, par 36 course which can be played by one or two players. The game is played from an overhead view of the course, which is complete with sand traps, water hazards, trees, and rough. The player doesn't have the ability to choose different clubs, so the distance the ball travels is controlled by how big of a backswing is taken. The direction is controlled by the location of the player in relation to the ball. When the player finally reaches the green, the view switches to a closeup of the green for putting. Two different skill levels are available which control the size of the cup and the amount of power lost in the rough or sand.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1980", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atari", "publishers": "Atari", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.08", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_(1980_video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSWDrJhsRWI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/7639\n"}
