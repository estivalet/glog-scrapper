You command a destroyer which can launch as many as four depth charges at a time. Your mission is to sink as many enemy subs as possible. But it\u2019s not that simple. Because Sub Scan is more than a shooting match. It\u2019s a game of strategy. A battle of wits. Can-and-mouse on the high seas between the hunter above and the hunted below.
