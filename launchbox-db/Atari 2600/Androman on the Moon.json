Androman also had a barcode scanner in his bottom that would read barcodes placed on the map so the 2600 (and the robot) knew where he was. Using a combination of the joystick and barcodes, the player could guide Androman around the floor mat and play various games. One of those games being Androman on the Moon.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Michael Case", "publishers": "Androbot", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.82", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWM3gfBn4QM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/82269\n"}
