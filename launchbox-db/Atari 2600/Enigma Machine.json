{"altername_name": [], "name": "Enigma Machine", "overview": "Write secret messages. Under the section labelled \u201cROTORS\u201d are the three rotor settings: you can select any of the five available rotors for each position. Below that, you can set the \u201cring settings\u201d, which help control how the carry works as the rotors increment their position. Below that, is the key: a three letter key, indicating the initial position of each rotor. Below that are six plug settings: these modify characters before and after they are sent through the encrypting rotors. Below that is the INPUT section. You can position the cursor around with the joystick, and select a key by hitting the fire button. The enigma machine then encrypts the character, and displays it in the scrolling display below the OUTPUT section.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "2005", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mark VandWettering", "publishers": "Self-Published", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/95558\n"}
