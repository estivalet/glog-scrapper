{"altername_name": [], "name": "RealSports Football", "overview": "RealSports Football is a one or two-player football simulation played on a horizontal scrolling field, with five players on each team. As in real football, the goal is to march down a 100-yard field using a combination of passing and running plays. There are three ways to score: crossing the defensive team's goal line is a touchdown worth seven points, kicking the ball through the defense's goal post is a field goal worth three points, and tackling the ball carrier inside the end zone is a safety worth two points.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atari", "publishers": "Atari", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.94", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RealSports_Football", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGorJSdg6ok", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/15384\n"}
