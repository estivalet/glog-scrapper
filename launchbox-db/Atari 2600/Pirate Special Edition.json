{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pirate Special Edition", "overview": "Arrrrr Matey! X Marks the Spot! Can you find the treasure of the evil pirate \"Up\" Chuck LeDuc? Beware! His bony corpse wanders the island looking to protect it! Also watch out for snakes and the voodoo priestess! Use the joystick to move around the island and use your fire button to fight/pick up items or use an item/enter or exit the hut. The window color represents what you are presently carrying (gray - nothing, blue - shovel, yellow - sword, green - shovel & sword). The color of the display in the window shows your health. You start with three hit points (3 - green, 2 - yellow, 1 - red). Snakes have 1 hit point each. The other enemies' hit points are randomly generated. There is a flower growing on the island that will restore your health, but it only works when it is fresh. Only use it when you actually need it! The treasure is marked by an X and you must have the shovel in your possession to dig it up. Can you find the treasure before LeDuc finds you? Special Edition has a move counter/score and other additions.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "February 4, 2007", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "David Weavil", "publishers": "AtariAge", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/122884\n"}
