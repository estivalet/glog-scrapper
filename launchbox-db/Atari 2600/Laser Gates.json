{"altername_name": ["Weltraumtunnel", "Innerspace", "Laaser Voley"], "name": "Laser Gates", "overview": "Laser Gates is a side scrolling shooter. Failsafe detonators inside the cryptic computer have malfunctioned, and your job is to pilot a spaceship to destroy them before they explode. The narrow passage you'll need to fly through is well guarded: deadly force fields appear and disappear, rocket launchers attack, and deadly byte bats will get in your way. Your ship has a limited shield; each time you are hit by one of these enemies, the shield loses energy. When the shields energy is completely gone, the game ends. Also be on the lookout for energy pods which can replenish the shield (these don't appear often, so be sure not to miss one)! To deal with some of the enemies and obstacles your ship is equipped with a laser. Naturally, your mission is timed: you will need to make your way to the next detonator before time expires and it explodes! Points are earned by disabling the detonators, destroying enemies and successfully making it past the force fields. When you reach the end of the 4th tunnel, there\u2019s no chip to shoot - the game just ends.
