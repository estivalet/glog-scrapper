{"altername_name": [], "name": "River Patrol", "overview": "River Patrol is a 1981 arcade game released by Orca and licensed to Kestern for distribution in the United States. A port was released for the Atari 2600 by Tigervision in 1984. Players take the role of the captain of a river patrol ship in this top-down game. Their mission: to save the poor souls who fell into the river by running them over with the patrol ship. In the ship's way lay boulders, crocodiles, and floating logs, all waiting to sink the vessel. The ship also sinks if it does not reach the dam before a time limit expires. There are 99 levels and it takes approximately 3 hours to complete. Once you have completed the game, your patrol boat crashes into the wall of the dam.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tigervision", "publishers": "Tigervision", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.88", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Patrol_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwHqJNZ_Lp8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/33173\n"}
