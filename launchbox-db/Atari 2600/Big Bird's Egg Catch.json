{"altername_name": [], "name": "Big Bird's Egg Catch", "overview": "Two chickens are laying eggs. You'll know one's about to drop when a chicken stands up. As they drop down the chutes, Farmer Big Bird moves back and forth to catch them. Different chute patterns make the game more difficult. This kids game is based on the classic Sesame Street character. It is intended for use with the kids controller, which is an oversized keyboard controller into which you insert the included overlay for this game. If you don't have a kids controller, the keyboard controller works fine, but you'll have to figure out what the buttons do.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "October 1, 1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Christopher H.
