{"altername_name": [], "name": "Balloon Trip", "overview": "You're floating high above the majestic ocean, held aloft by balloons as you gaze your surroundings. But this is no ordinary, leisurely flight! Your goal in Balloon Trip is to collect as many balloons as possible, all the while avoiding electric sparks that will pop your balloons and bring a tragic end to your journey! And if the sparks didn't provide enough danger for you, the water below is also treacherous, full of aggressive fish that will leap into the air to pull you into the murky depths below! So be sure you keep an adequate distance between you and the water, as you don't want to become fish food! Balloon Trip is a one player game using a joystick plugged into the left controller jack. Pressing the fire button allows you to flap upwards. You'll need to press the button repeatedly in order to ascend. Pressing either left or right on the joystick will allow you to flap towards the respective direction.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "2018", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bluswimmer", "publishers": "AtariAge", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.6", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/124378\n"}
