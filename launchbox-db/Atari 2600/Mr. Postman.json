{"altername_name": ["Der Postmann"], "name": "Mr. Postman", "overview": "Mr. Postman puts you in control of a mail carrier tasked with getting a very important package to a house in the City of Silence. The first step is taming the eagle that will carry Mr. Postman to his destination. This is done by climbing a tree on the far right edge of the screen, jumping onto a swinging vine and finally dropping onto the eagle\u2019s back, all while avoiding the bird\u2019s \u201cdroppings.\u201d Now, there are many things the nondescript white squares emanating from the eagle could be, and what exactly they are isn\u2019t important. What is important is that getting hit by one costs a life. So don\u2019t get hit by one.
