{"altername_name": [], "name": "Acid Drop", "overview": "A falling block game similar to Columns. The object of the game is to create a horizontal or vertical line of three or more blocks of the same color, which will then disappear. The remaining blocks will fall down, but won't disappear if they form another line. Every 10,000 points a special block will appear (the Acid Drop) which removes three columns of blocks and marks the beginning of the next level. This was the last OFFICIAL Atari 2600 commercial game. It was only released in Europe.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dennis M.
