{"altername_name": ["Sancho: Words"], "name": "Words-Attack", "overview": "Words Attack was re-discovered in 2002 and appears to be the rarest of all Sancho games. Your ship is attacked by three invaders from above, while letters and objects (fruit, hearts, creatures, etc) appear on alternating rows between you and the enemy. Shooting a letter will make it appear in the space below your ship. Shooting an object or being shot by the enemy will cause a letter to disappear from your row and will also cause you to loose a life.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sancho", "publishers": "Sancho", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "0.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78496\n"}
