{"altername_name": [], "name": "Spider Fighter", "overview": "Spider Fighter is an arcade style action game somewhat similar to Space Invaders. You control a bug blaster at the bottom of the screen, and need to defend the three pieces of fruit at the top right of the screen. Various types of attacking spiders scurry around rapidly, trying to destroy your blaster and steal the fruit. If all of your fruit is stolen or you lose all of your bug blasters, the game is over. When all the spiders on a round are destroyed, you move on to the next, faster round. If you still have all three pieces of fruit when a round is completed, you receive an extra bug blaster.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "January 1, 1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Activision", "publishers": "Activision", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.82", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider_Fighter", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBXqk8QvYoY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1316\n"}
