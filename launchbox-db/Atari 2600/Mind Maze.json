{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mind Maze", "overview": "A game based on ESP? Yes you heard me right, Mind Maze is the first (and only) Atari game to be based on the unproven (yet still popular) theory of ESP (Extra Sensory Perception). It appears Atari was attempting to develop a sort of \"Mind Reading\" game for its new Mindlink controller. So can the 2600 really read your thoughts? Read on to find out... Mind Maze is played somewhat like those old mind reading experiments where a scientist would hold up a card and ask a person to tell him what was on the other side. Depending on the game selected, two to four cards appear on the screen each round. The player then must try and guess the \"correct\" card by highlighting it (using the joystick) and pressing the fire button. Unfortunately this is where the game begins to fall apart. As you've probably guessed the theory of ESP is pretty far fetched, and the odds that the player can continually guess the correct card is slim. So the player must simply sit there and randomly select cards until he by chance selects the correct one.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gary Shannon", "publishers": "Never Published (Prototype)", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTd9YP1k05k", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78561\n"}
