{"altername_name": [], "name": "Freeway", "overview": "Freeway was one of the first titles released by Activision in their effort to publish independent games for the Atari 2600. One or two players control chickens who can be made to run across a ten lane highway filled with traffic in an effort to \"get to the other side.\" Every time a chicken gets across a point is earned for that player. If hit by a car, a chicken is forced back either slightly, or pushed back to the bottom of the screen, depending on what difficulty the switch is set to. The winner of a two player game is the player who has scored the most points in the two minutes, sixteen seconds allotted. Alternate Titles \"\"Das Verruckte Huhn\"\" -- German title \"Bloody Human Freeway\" -- Activision prototype title Trivia Before Freeway became a game about a chicken crossing the road, it was originally known as Bloody Human Freeway. While the gameplay was exactly the same, players controlled a human instead of a chicken. If the cars hit the person, he would explode into a little blood splatter instead of being bounced backwards. Bloody Human Freeway can be found in playable form on the Game Boy Advance version of Activision Anthology.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "July 15, 1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "David Crane", "publishers": "Activision", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.19", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeway_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGMnbhULr-4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/5048\n"}
