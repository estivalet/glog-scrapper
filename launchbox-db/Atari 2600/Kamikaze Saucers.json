{"altername_name": ["Kaboom: Schneller Als der Knall"], "name": "Kamikaze Saucers", "overview": "There was no mention of Kamikaze Saucers on any game list, but Syncro did take out full page ads for the game so they must have been close to releasing it. Eventually, Syncro made the decision in staying out of the crumbling video game market. Kamikaze Saucers was a little known 2600 game that most people assumed was never even started. However after the programmer gave the rom image to Atari Age to be distributed to the gaming community, the game proved to be very much real. There was no mention of Kamikaze Saucers on any game list, but Syncro did take out full page ads for the game so they must have been close to releasing it. All these things make this prototype all the more interesting, and makes one wonder what other games Syncro may have had in the works. Kamikaze Saucers is your average shooter along the lines of Atlantis or Demon Attack. You must shoot down the saucers that buzz across the screen using your oversized phallic looking ship. If if fail to shoot the saucers down in a timely manner they will go Kamikaze on you big time! Three large ships will come at you from the top of the screen, and if you can't destroy them before they crash into you you'll lose a life.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Daniel Wolf", "publishers": "Syncro, Inc.", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BD0tNDlb5g8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78395\n"}
