{"altername_name": ["Adventures on GX-12", "Robotron"], "name": "Adventures of TRON", "overview": "Adventures of TRON is based on the motion picture TRON from Walt Disney Productions. The game was released in Europe after the Walt Disney license expired as \"Adventures on GX-12\". The game environment consists of 4 floors, each with flying \"bits\" as well as enemy MCP attackers. The objective of the game is to control TRON (you) in a maze of platforms and elevators while trying to intercept the flying bits (intercepting bits on higher floors are awarded higher points). Dodge enemy MCP attackers by jumping, using elevators and hitching a ride on the Silver Sailor. Capturing all 7 \"bits\" will take you to the next level, with added speed and difficulty.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "APh Technological Consulting", "publishers": "Mattel Electronics", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.62", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventures_of_Tron", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfKvqHBBNYE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/10449\n"}
