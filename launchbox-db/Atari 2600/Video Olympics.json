{"altername_name": ["Pong Sports"], "name": "Video Olympics", "overview": "Video Olympics is an action game containing numerous variations of the game Pong. Two players (or one player against the computer) control paddles on the screen and attempt to prevent a bouncing ball from getting past them. In the most basic game variations, each player has a single paddle and there are no obstacles on the screen. The other game variations add paddles and obstacles, and some are loosely inspired by various sports and change the playfield around, but the goal remains the same: hit the ball past your opponents paddle into the goal to earn points.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "September 11, 1977", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atari", "publishers": "Atari", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.44", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_Olympics", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/7649\n"}
