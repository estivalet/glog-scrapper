{"altername_name": [], "name": "Missile Command", "overview": "Aliens from the planet of Krytol are attacking your cities! As the commander of a missile base, it is your responsibility to defend them. A variety of enemy weapons and planes will be incoming trying to destroy the six cities at the bottom of the screen. You need to fire missiles to destroy the incoming weapons. If anything gets through, one of your cities could be destroyed. When all of the cities are gone, the game is over. On each level you have a limited amount of ammo, so make sure most (if not all) of your shots are accurate or you could run out of ammo and leave your cities at risk! As the levels progress, there are more and more enemy weapons to destroy which come in at an increasingly faster rate. Other versions with a different title: Airbone Assault Comando de Misseis Fire Burg F\u00fcze Savaslari Misil Command Missele Command Missil Command Missile Attack Missile Command (Comando de M\u00edsseis) Missle Command Raumroboter Robot Fight Space Robet Space Robot Space-Robot On game #13, end the game with 90 points scored or less (score no points during the round, and have 3 or less missiles left in your base) and the letters RF (for Rob Fulop) will appear in the right-most city. Two different versions exist. One version doesn't contain Rob Fulop's initials, the other does.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atari", "publishers": "Atari", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.97", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile_Command", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eix2gPfPw1s", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/5057\n"}
