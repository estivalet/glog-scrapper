{"altername_name": [], "name": "Kool-Aid Man", "overview": "When the troublemaking Thirsties enact their plan of draining water out of the local swimming pool with their drinking straws, it's up to Kool-Aid Man to stop them! Kool-Aid man must gather up Kool-Aid soft drink mix in order to catch and put a stop to the Thirsties' scheme. The three ingredients are Water (W), Sugar (S), and Kool-Aid (K). If the Thirsties touch Kool-Aid Man, he gets bounced around the yard, losing time, and the pool gets drained further. If the Thirsties succeed in draining the pool, it's \"Game Over\" for Kool-Aid Man. If Kool-Aid Man succeeds, then he wins and goes on to the next level of difficulty. Oh Yeah! Have the TV Type switch on B&W. During a game you need to be at the top of the screen when the timer is at 40 seconds. At that moment, hit Select and you'll turn into the letters JT (for Jane Terjung) and all the Thirsties will turn into ST (for Stephen Tatsumi). If you turn into Kool-Aid Man, you'll be a large JT.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jane Terjung", "publishers": "Mattel Electronics", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.93", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kool-Aid_Man_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qg7lRnVlVLQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/28799\n"}
