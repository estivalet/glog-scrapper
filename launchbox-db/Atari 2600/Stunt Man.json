Stuntman is broken down into three timed stages. The first stage has the stuntman climbing ropes in order to get to a helicopter while also dodging flying birds. The second stage has the stuntman climbing ropes again but now arms him with a sword and requires him to defeat the flying devilfaces before he can make his escape. The third stage has the stuntman climbing ropes again dodging enemies, but he must also grab a hold of all of the balloons on the stage before he make his getaway. The stages then repeat in this order two more times with the later stages increasing the challenge by adding more enemies. After completing the nine stages, the game repeats at the next highest speed level. There are six speed levels in total and the desired speed level may be chosen from the beginning also.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "December 23, 1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tang's Electronic Co., Ltd.", "publishers": "Panda, Inc.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83259\n"}
