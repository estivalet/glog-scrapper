{"altername_name": [], "name": "Strip Off 2", "overview": "16 Game Modes to choose from! This is a 1 player game where you try to keep the alien from stealing all of your planetary barrier components. Objective: The game ends when all of your barrier has been stripped away by the alien or you are shot by the aliens reflected shot on Advanced mode. You score 1 point for each alien destroyed. When you are down to 10 barrier chunks on beginner or 25 barrier chunks on advanced the alien doubles in speed! Your barrier gets replenished every 20 points at first but increases by 2 for each two levels cleared.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "", "developers": "John Reder", "publishers": "TACTICAL NEURONICS", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/124481\n"}
