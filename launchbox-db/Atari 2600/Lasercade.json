{"altername_name": [], "name": "Lasercade", "overview": "The first thing you're bound to notice upon booting Lasercade is how nice the graphics look. It's hard to believe that the 2600 can do a 3/4th perspective shooting game, but Lasercade is the proof. The goal of the game is to shoot all the targets in the upper section of the screen before time runs out (that's original). However, while you can just start shooting willy nilly, you should probably take a second to look at the funny little targets in the middle section of the screen. In the middle section of the the screen there are three rotating mirrors. As you may have guessed, these mirrors can play havoc with your laser if you're not careful. If you shoot a mirror while it is facing you, it will reflect the laser back at you and you will lose some time and be momentarily stunned. However if you shoot the mirror while its back is to you, you can destroy it so it won't bother you until the next round. While this may sound a bit complicated, it's often best just to ignore the mirrors and shoot at the targets themselves. The number of mirrors can be controlled with the left difficulty switch.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Lee Actor", "publishers": "Never Published (Prototype)", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2VfUapQlco", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/82387\n"}
