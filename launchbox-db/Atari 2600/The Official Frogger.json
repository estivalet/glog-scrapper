{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Official Frogger", "overview": "The player guides a frog which starts at the bottom of the screen, to his home in one of 5 slots at the top of the screen. The lower half of the screen contains a road with motor vehicles, which in various versions include cars, trucks, buses, dune buggies, bulldozers, vans, taxis, bicyclists, and/or motorcycles, speeding along it horizontally. This version of Frogger is different than the Parker Brothers cartridge-based release in 1982. The 1983 Starpath version of Frogger utilized the Starpath Supercharger expansion peripheral created by Starpath for playing cassette-based proprietary games on the Atari 2600. Although Parker Brothers owned exclusive rights to cartridges of Frogger, they did not own the magnetic media rights, opening the door for Starpath to create their own version. The game is one of a few cassette based games ever released for the Starpath Supercharger. Unlike the first two games Landrum designed for Starpath, this one does not contain a secret way to see the designer\u2019s initials.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Starpath Corporation", "publishers": "Starpath Corporation", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.41", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogger", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgO2-Hy9Hi4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/33143\n"}
