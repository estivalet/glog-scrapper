{"altername_name": ["Philly Flasher/Cathouse Blues"], "name": "Philly Flasher", "overview": "This is a doubled-ended cartridge with Philly Flasher on one end and Cathouse Blues on the other. Philly Flasher is a graphically altered version of Beat 'Em & Eat 'Em with guys (or a guy) doing the catching and what they are catching looks to be milk from a witch's tit. The game plays just like Beat 'Em & Eat 'Em otherwise except the guy(s) masturbate after each round. Cathouse Blues is a graphically altered version of Gigolo in which you are a guy going to various whorehouses to get \"serviced\". The game is otherwise the same as Gigolo.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Joel H.
