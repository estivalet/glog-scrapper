{"altername_name": [], "name": "Superman", "overview": "The Man of Steel takes flight in his first video game adaptation. When Lex Luthor destroys the Metropolis bridge, Clark Kent must run to the nearest phone booth to become Superman and save the day. Along the way, Superman must be wary of thugs, a helicopter that can either help or hinder him, three Kryptonite satellites, and even Lex Luthor himself. If Superman meets with one of Luthor's Kryptonite traps, he becomes unable to fly, unless he can find Lois Lane for help. Repair the bridge, put the crooks in jail, then get back to the Daily Planet in time for the next adventure.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1978", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atari", "publishers": "Atari", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.98", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman_(1979_video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7U2TFIayos", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/5076\n"}
