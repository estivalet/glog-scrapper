{"altername_name": [], "name": "Motocross", "overview": "Motocross is a motorcycle racing game viewed from a top-down perspective. The player rides a bike against an endless number of opponents on a straight road, trying to avoid running into them. In addition, the player has to watch the amount of gas left in the tank. The fuel gauge can be restored by driving over fuel cans. The goal of the game is to overtake a specified amount of bikes. Once this is accomplished, a new \"scene\" starts, and the difficulty is increased.
