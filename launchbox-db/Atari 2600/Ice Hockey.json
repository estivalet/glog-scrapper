{"altername_name": ["Le Hockey sur Glace", "Eishockey-Fieber", "Ice Hockey: Eis-Hockey", "Ice Hockey: Le Hockey Sur Glace"], "name": "Ice Hockey", "overview": "Ice Hockey is an ice hockey game for one player against the computer or two players facing off against each other. Each team consists of two players, one offensive and one defensive. At any given time, one player is active and can be controlled while the other remains inactive; if the puck is near your goal, then the defensive player becomes active, otherwise, you control the offensive player. Each player has the ability to shoot the puck at a variety of angles, and can even body-check their opponent! The game lasts for three minutes, and whoever scores more points by the end of that time wins. The game can be played at normal or high speed, and optionally one of the players can be handicapped to give an inexperienced player more of an advantage.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Alan Miller", "publishers": "Activision", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.07", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_Hockey_(1981_video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WITab4i-8e0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/7641\n"}
