{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tomarc the Barbarian", "overview": "From the classic tradition of fantasy heroes comes TOMARC the Barbarian. Lost in a maze of underground caves, TOMARC searches for his lost sword with which he can save the lovely SENTA. She is held prisoner in a magical cage in ruins above the caves. You control TOMARC as he searches caverns and avoids deadly rat-like creatures, and SENTA as she fights off vampire bats from her prison. Multiscreen action as you control both characters in each scene at the same time! You must listen for the danger sounds from the nonvisible screen and quickly rush to the rescue.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "K-Tel Software Inc.", "publishers": "Xonox", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "0.88", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78442\n"}
