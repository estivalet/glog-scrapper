You get 10 points for each pirate killed and an extra life at 500 points.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "TechnoVision", "publishers": "Quelle", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/q-s42sW3Iow", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78416\n"}
