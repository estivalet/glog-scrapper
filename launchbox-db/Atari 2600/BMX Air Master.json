{"altername_name": [], "name": "BMX Air Master", "overview": "This isn't kid stuff! It's the fastest, flyingest, most unforgiving trio of events any biker could ask for. Start with a Half Pipe that takes you so high you won't know whether you're coming or going. Then do a Quarter Pipe that makes doing dozens of tricks easy and crashing even easier. Then try the Ramp Jump. It's the jump that's just a bit wider than the Grand Canyon. If there's a more dangerous challenge open to daredevil BMX bikers, we have yet to test it. So, if you think you're good - really good - put your freewheeling skills on the line with BMX AirMaster! Trivia Release history Soon after TNT Games released BMX Air Master, Atari purchased the rights to it. Atari then released it in limited numbers and sold even less than released. Because it was released in limited quantity, sold so poorly and near the end of the Atari 2600's life, it is one of the rarest releases from Atari.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "January 1, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sculptured Software", "publishers": "TNT", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.07", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMX_Airmaster", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uI8bjWqjhQ0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/16969\n"}
