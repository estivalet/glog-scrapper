{"altername_name": ["Bachelor Party: Gigolo", "Cathouse Blues"], "name": "Gigolo", "overview": "This was a double-ended cartridge that contained Bachelor Party on one end and a new game, Gigolo, on the other. In Gigolo, men will leave the jail and head to various houses. The player, controlling a female, must collect some money from the bank and then make their way to the houses for sex she pays these men for. Once the money is in hand, the player has to avoid the thief who is out to rob all that cash. The game will end if the thief succeeds. After the woman is finished having intercourse with a man, she has to try to avoid or outrun the police. If she is arrested three times, the game is over. To run, move while holding down the button. It's best the player doesn't make her run everywhere or the police will chase you, thinking she is up to something. The lady earns one point for each pelvic thrust she experiences from a male.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mystique", "publishers": "PlayAround", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcoRIPg6FJI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/46259\n"}
