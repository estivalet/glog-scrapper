{"altername_name": [], "name": "Okie Dokie", "overview": "Okie Dokie was the first original homebrew game written for the Atari 2600 by Bob Colbert. Okie Dokie is a fast moving puzzle game that challenges you with 30 preset puzzles and 435 random puzzles. It seems simple enough, turn off all of the squares. Well, there's a catch! Every time you select a square, it gets \"flipped\" -- if it was on it turns off and visa versa. To complicate things further, any square directly to the left, right, above, or below the square is also \"flipped.\"", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "", "developers": "Bob Colbert", "publishers": "RetroWare", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/114709\n"}
