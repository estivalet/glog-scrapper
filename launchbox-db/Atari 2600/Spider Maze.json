{"altername_name": ["Spider Monster", "Spider Kong", "Pac-Kong"], "name": "Spider Maze", "overview": "This rare game from K-Tel Vision was probably sold exclusively in Canada. It is easier to find in PAL format, as it had more distribution overseas. Game play is similar to Donkey Kong. The player controls an \"adventurer\" and has to reach the treasures the evil octopus hid away. Each level consists of a series of platforms that are interconnected by ladders. The only action the player can take besides moving around is pressing fire to make the hero jump. This is necessary to get across the gaps between some of the platforms. At the same time, the player has to avoid the smaller octopi as well as clouds of poison gas which move around the screen randomly. Once the player reaches one of the treasure chests at the top of the screen they won the level and a new round starts. Game can also be played by two players in an alternating fashion.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "K-Tel Vision", "publishers": "K-Tel Vision", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72359\n"}
