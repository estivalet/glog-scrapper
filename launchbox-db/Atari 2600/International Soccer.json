{"altername_name": [], "name": "International Soccer", "overview": "International Soccer is an action soccer game for two players. The game follows typical soccer rules; attempt to score more goals than your opponent in the two 45 minute periods (this is in simulated time). You control one player on your team at a time while the computer takes control of the rest. The game allows you to dribble and pass, and features throw ins, corner kicks, goal kicks, and in the event of a tie the game goes in to overtime! Several skill levels are available which control the speed of the game. Although the back of the box says there are two skill levels (amateur and pro), there is actually only one skill level and the difficulty switches have no effect on the game.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "APh Technological Consulting", "publishers": "M-Network", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.93", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7hERXZotkI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/8898\n"}
