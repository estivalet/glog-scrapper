{"altername_name": [], "name": "Jawbreaker", "overview": "Unlike the Apple II and Atari 8-bit versions, the Atari 2600 version of Jawbreaker is not a Pac-Man clone. Instead, you have a screen with nine horizontal levels. There are dots, candies, if you will, on each level. You must eat all the candies to get a teeth brushing and advance to the next, harder, level. Also on the levels are happy faces. They are happy to knock your teeth out, which they will do if you touch them. This will lose you a life. When all lives are lost, the game is over. Three times per level, a vitamin pill will appear in the center of the screen. If you eat this, the faces will turn red, allowing you to eat them for a short time. The faces will flash red and white, briefly, before returning to normal, as a warning. To move from level to level, there are moving openings on the levels or you can move to the far left or far right of the screen.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "On-Line Systems", "publishers": "Tigervision", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.08", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jawbreaker_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1WxPY45BAk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/34469\n"}
