{"altername_name": ["Fun With Numbers"], "name": "Basic Math", "overview": "Basic Math (re-released as Fun With Numbers) is a math game for children. Each game gives the player a set of ten basic math problems (i.e. simple addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) to solve. The player is presented with two numbers and a function, then inputs the answer by cycling through numbers with the joystick. A timer option is available to ramp up the difficulty. The game has eight primary game settings - basically two settings for each mathematical function. Games 1-4 allow the player to select one of the numbers the player will be working with, while 5-8 give random questions.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "September 11, 1977", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gary Palmer", "publishers": "Atari", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Math_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cr1hBWIAVM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/10451\n"}
