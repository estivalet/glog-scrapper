{"altername_name": [], "name": "Confrontation", "overview": "Confrontation is a strange strategy game which was never commercially released, but was available directly from Answer for a short time. Only people who saw it on display at the 1983 CES show would have know about it and ordered it so while it's not technically a prototype, it's close enough. I've racked my brain on how to best describe the gameplay of this game, and after much searching I've determined the best description is in Leonard Herman's \"ABC's to the VCS\" (pick up a copy today!). Since Confrontation uses a programming trick to display so many objects on the screen at once, screenshots will only show one players pieces at a time. Take my word for it, they're really all there.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ellis, Kim", "publishers": "Answer Software Corporation", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8jeqBQAQJc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78393\n"}
