{"altername_name": [], "name": "Alien", "overview": "In this game, based loosely on the movie of the same name, the player moves through a maze (the halls of your ship, according to the game's manual), \u00e0 la Pac-Man, collecting dots (destroying alien eggs). If you collect the power dot (pulsar), you can kill any of the three aliens, for a short time. When you grab the pulsar, it will next appear in one of two other spots. A bonus item occasionally appears. After you clear one level, you get a bonus game. You have to move up the screen to the prize at the top past several aliens, reminiscent of Freeway. You do not lose a life if you fail, but you only have eight seconds to reach the prize before you are off the the next, harder level.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "January 1, 1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Fox Video Games, Inc.", "publishers": "Fox Video Games, Inc.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.58", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOZ7TIx5Zv8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/18433\n"}
