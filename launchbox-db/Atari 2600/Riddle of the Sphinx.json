{"altername_name": [], "name": "Riddle of the Sphinx", "overview": "As the Pharoh's Son, it is up to the player to lift the curse of Anubis, God of the Dead, by reaching the Temple of Ra, and solving the riddle of the Sphinx. Armed with a sling and a pile of rocks, the Prince must navigate past thieves and scorpions on his journey. He can trade with wandering nomads, dig for buried treasure, make offerings to the gods, or seek counsel and healing with Isis, the goddess of fertility and motherhood. Great care must be exercised in his journey, for the Prince can weaken from thirst, which can be be replenished at an oasis or from certain treasures. He will also sustain wounds from the hostile creatures of the land, including Anubis himself. Once the Prince visits the various temples of the desert and makes his offerings, he must choose to make the correct offering (or offerings) to the Temple of Ra. Choose wisely, and the Prince is rewarded. Choose poorly, and the Prince loses inner strength points, and Egypt remains cursed.
