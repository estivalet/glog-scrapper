{"altername_name": [], "name": "Buck Rogers: Planet of Zoom", "overview": "It's the 25th century. You are Buck Rogers fighting the battle of Planet Zoom. This is a race against death. Your ultimate and most powerful enemy is the deadly MOTHER SHIP! There are 16 levels of increasing difficulty - each with four rounds of challenging space combat. Before you meet the MOTHER SHIP, your pilot skills and nerve are tested against deadly ELECTRON POSTS, ALIEN SAUCERS and smashing SPACE HOPPERS. This is a battle of speed, accuracy and endurance. Your time consumption is crucial to your survival. If you deplete your time you lose one of your five fighter ships. The faster you fly, the sooner you'll get to the MOTHER SHIP, allowing yourself more time to destroy it. You begin with a full time line when you destroy the MOTHER SHIP. Be aggressive but don't be reckless. This is do or die cosmic combat and it's the MOTHER SHIP or YOU!", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.58", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buck_Rogers:_Planet_of_Zoom", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ZOHdIngx0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21569\n"}
