{"altername_name": [], "name": "Football", "overview": "Football is a football game for two players. The game is played from a top down point of view of the field and features two skill levels and three game variations. Using the joystick you can choose from one of five different offensive or defensive plays. In the first game variation, after selecting a play you then control the players on the field. In the second game, you have the option of controlling your players after a play is selected or allowing the computer to control the players. The third game has the computer controlling the players at all times and you only need to select the plays you wish it to execute and indicate when you wish to punt or pass the ball. In all of the game variations the timer begins at 5 minutes, and is active only during plays. Of course, the team with the most points when the timer runs out wins! GAME 1: After programming your play, use the Joystick to control your players. The offensive player controls only the ball carrier and the flight of the pass or punt. The defensive player controls his lineman or, by holding the red controller button down, the defensive back. The players will randomly follow the play as programmed when not controlled by your Joystick. GAME 2: In this game, when your players are not controlled by the Joystick, they will follow the play exactly as programmed. Use more strategy and try to outguess your opponent's plays. GAME 3: Program in your offensive and defensive plays and watch the computer run them out. Neither player can control the players movements, but the offense can pass or punt the ball by pushing the red controller button.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "April 1, 1979", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atari", "publishers": "Atari", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.56", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_(1978_video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxjcIm-UT1g", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21564\n"}
