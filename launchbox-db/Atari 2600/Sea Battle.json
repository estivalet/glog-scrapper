{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sea Battle", "overview": "The object of the game is to deploy your battleships, submarines, aircraft carriers and more from your harbors. Then strategically battle your way across the seas in an effort to gain access and infiltrate your opponent's harbors. It's a bitter fight to the end! The game has only a player versus player option. The Atari version was simplified from the Intellivision port due to the lack of keyboard on the 2600. Sea Battle was finished at M Network in the 1980\u2019s, but never released. In 2000, Intellivision Productions released this game complete with a simple box and manual. Sea Battle is the Atari 2600 version of the Intellivision game of the same name. At one point it was called High Seas, which was consistent with M Network\u2019s policy of changing the name of a game when it appeared on a different system.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bruce Pederson", "publishers": "M-Network", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_Battle", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72724\n"}
