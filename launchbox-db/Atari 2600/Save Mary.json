{"altername_name": ["Save Mary!"], "name": "Save Mary", "overview": "Save Mary! was one of those 2600 revival titles that should have been released but was ultimately lost when Atari closed its Atari 2600 operations in 1990. Save Mary! may have been in development longer than any other Atari 2600 game (over two years according to some sources). One reason for this was Atari management constantly making changes to an already complex game, but another reason for the long development cycle was that programmer Tod Frye (of Pac-Man fame) may only have been working part time for Atari at the time and was also working on another unreleased 2600 game Shooting Arcade. No matter what the reasons were it's a shame Save Mary! never got released, as it's a fun and highly original game.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tod Frye", "publishers": "Atari", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78415\n"}
