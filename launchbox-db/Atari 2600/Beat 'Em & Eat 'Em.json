{"altername_name": ["Philly Flasher"], "name": "Beat 'Em & Eat 'Em", "overview": "Beat 'Em & Eat 'Em is an \"adult\" electronic video game based upon an ancient ritual that has been passed down from generation-to-generation as part of the culture's oral tradition. The object of the game is to eat 'em every time he beats 'em. You score one point for each and every drop you swallow without a miss. But should you miss, shame on you. You lose one turn. After all, it could have been a famous doctor or lawyer. You have four turns at the outset of the game. Small squares in the lower left-hand corner of the screen indicate the remaining number of turns at any point in the game. You can earn \"bonus turns\" for every \"69\" points you score; however, you may accumulate no more than 6 turns plus the one in play at any given time.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Joel H.
