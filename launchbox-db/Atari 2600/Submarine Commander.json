{"altername_name": [], "name": "Submarine Commander", "overview": "Submarine Commander is one of those games that taxes your ability to \"fill in the gaps\" where 8 bit pixels fail to paint the whole picture. I could have said it was \"graphically challenged\" or \"looks like Hell\", but it's a better game than first glance might reveal. There are a slew of crappy looking one-dimensional games out there for the Atari 2600, but submarine Commander isn't one of them. Someone put a good deal of thought into it and gave it life beyond a simple single-screen game.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atari", "publishers": "Sears, Roebuck and Co.", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.8", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/56313\n"}
