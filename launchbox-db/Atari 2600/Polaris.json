{"altername_name": [], "name": "Polaris", "overview": "You're the commander of a Polaris class nuclear submarine. Your mission is to defend your country from enemy attack. You must face one to three enemy subs and one to five bombers in a squad. You must destroy the bombers by shooting missiles. After you destroy the bomber squadron, you must face a dive bomber dropping torpedoes that plunge to your depth then move horizontally. After destroying him, you must navigate through a channel, avoiding or torpedoing mines to reach the next level. Occasionally, an enemy destroyer will move across the screen and will drop a depth charge.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Taito", "publishers": "Tigervision", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.38", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polaris_(arcade_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMYQ-Y_L6UU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1326\n"}
