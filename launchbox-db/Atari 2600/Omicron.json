{"altername_name": [], "name": "Omicron", "overview": "A team of four agents, each a specialist in one of the four elements - water, fire, air and earth - have been miniaturized to microscopic size in order to investigate a mysterious new virus that appears to be of alien origin. The virus mutates rapidly, mimicking each of the four elements. But something went horribly wrong, and contact with the team was lost. Now the virus threatens to grow out-of-control. You are the last hope to stop it. Having been miniaturized yourself, you now board the Omicron - a microscopic vessel designed specifically to counter the alien virus and stop it from spreading. Can you battle your way through each iteration of the virus and destroy the threat? Our enemy is an alien virus, whose behavior mutates to mimic the four elements of water, fire, air and earth. As part of its mutation, the virus periodically releases immune fragments. To neutralize the enemy you must collect these fragments. When you have collected enough, you will move on to the next infected area. When you enter an infected area, the enemy spreads without paying attention to you. Once you collect a fragment, the virus elements will become aware of your presence, and will start to hunt you down until the next fragment is released.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "2013", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Simone Serra", "publishers": "AtariAge", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eXY4Sdblo8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/124470\n"}
