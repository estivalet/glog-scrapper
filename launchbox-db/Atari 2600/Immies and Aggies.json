{"altername_name": ["Spectracube Invasion", "Immies & Aggies"], "name": "Immies and Aggies", "overview": "Immies and Aggies is an odd shooting game that involves marbles (yes marbles). For you see, Immies and Aggies are actually types of marbles (Aggies are agates, while Immies are glass imitations of agates), although from the game graphics you really can't tell. In fact the graphics consist mostly of squares that appear to be randomly placed around the screen. If you squint and stare really hard at the screen you can almost imagine that those squares are anything (marbles, alien bases, E.T. carts, etc.). However the poor graphics really don't distract much from the poor gameplay. There's a reason these things weren't released in the US... although it was released in Brazil by CCE.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Zimag", "publishers": "CCE", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zAMJhd6BL8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78556\n"}
