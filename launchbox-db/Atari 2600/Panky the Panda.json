{"altername_name": [], "name": "Panky the Panda", "overview": "As Panky the Panda, you must rescue your brother from the poacher's cave. But it will not be easy! The poacher's lair is packed with various minions as well as secret rooms disguised as unassuming walls, so stay on the lookout! Depending on the amount of keys and special items in his inventory, Panky can move through over 120 danger-filled screens. While exploring the caves, stay alert, as there are many dangers that can put a quick end to your brother's rescue! These include bats, cave pigs, duck goons, fireballs, spiked platforms, and more! And also be careful not to fall to your death as Pandas cannot fly! Be on the lookout for the six keys that will open doors throughout the cave. And watch for special items that can help you on your quest! These include the candle, high jump boots, flute, holy book, and snow boots. Remember that not all walls are as they appear! The cave is filled with secret pathways used by the poachers. If you get stuck, we've included a map that could offer a clue to help you past your current quagmire!", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "2010", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "", "developers": "Ben Larson", "publishers": "AtariAge", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/131132\n"}
