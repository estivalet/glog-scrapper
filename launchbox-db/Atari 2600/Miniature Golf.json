{"altername_name": ["Miniature Golf: Arcade Golf", "Arcade Golf"], "name": "Miniature Golf", "overview": "This is a computer game simulation of a miniature golf course. It attempts to refine your sense of timing and your perceptiveness in judging distance. As in a traditional miniature golf course, a variety of obstacles are placed in your path to the cup. Depending on the game that is selected, the course can be played solo, or a two player competition can be initiated. Rather than a full 18 holes, this miniature golf variation has a nine-hole half-course. Your goal is clear: taking the various obstacles into account, hit the ball through the course and complete each hole by knocking the ball into the cup. The number of attempts you make for a single hole is tallied as strokes. While total strokes are unlimited, each hole still has a specific par assigned to it. So ideally, you should make it your goal to not exceed the par assigned to each hole. Using the standard joystick controller, you can position the club to adjust the strength and angle of how the ball is hit. Remember that no matter how many strokes have accrued, it is necessary to get the ball in the cup before the game continues on to the next hole.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "April 1, 1979", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tom Reuterdahl", "publishers": "Atari, Inc.", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniature_Golf_(Atari_2600)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8znfj2t8WYA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/16981\n"}
