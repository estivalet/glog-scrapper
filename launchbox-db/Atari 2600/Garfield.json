When Woita heard this, he didn't take the news very well, but he had little time to protest as most of Atari's staff was laid off. To make a long story short, Garfield was never finished. According to Woita, Garfield still needed about 2 to 3 months of work before it would be complete.

Garfield finally turned up when Jim Davis finally gave Woita permission to distribute the rom", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atari", "publishers": "Atari", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.36", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garfield_(Atari_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__0xfm8lT0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/50699\n"}
