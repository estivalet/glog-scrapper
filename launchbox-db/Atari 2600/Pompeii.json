{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pompeii", "overview": "Pompeii was one of the last titles announced by Apollo, but went unreleased when Apollo became one of the first VCS game companies to fold in the wake of the crash. From box art and a few brief descriptions we can surmise that the game revolved around an Indiana Jones like archaeologist who is trying to find treasures in the ruins of the ancient city of Pompeii. Unfortunately, the only prototype that has surfaced is far from complete. It is little more than a movement demo, although bits of leftover code indicate that other features were planned such as being able to fire bullets and something that had to do with rocks. Unfortunately variable names (BULLETR and DNROCK) are all that remains of these. It's hard to judge a game based on such an early prototype, but from what's been implemented Pompeii was looking pretty good. After several mediocre titles Apollo may have actually had a decent chance with this game, but the crash wouldn't wait for them to prove themselves.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Apollo", "publishers": "Never Published (Prototype)", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hj_9EnYxqvU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72358\n"}
