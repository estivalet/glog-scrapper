{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bugs Bunny", "overview": "This game was never released and can be found only as a prototype. Pick one of the levels, steal a carrot, then jump Bugs into his hole before Elmer shoots him. Although this prototype is playable, it looks to be not quite finished. Bugs Bunny was probably supposed to be part of Atari's Children's series, but was shelved in favor of Snoopy and the Red Baron. The initials BP AJM (for Bob Polaro and Allen J. Murphy) are hidden in the game. On level 11, get shot while jumping to the right. The cart, box and manual are reproductions from 2002 with permission of programmer Bob Polaro.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Polaro, Robert C.", "publishers": "Unreleased Prototype", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa0y8WRbMFA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/33176\n"}
