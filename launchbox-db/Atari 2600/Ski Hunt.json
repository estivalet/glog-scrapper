{"altername_name": ["Mountain Man"], "name": "Ski Hunt", "overview": "Ski Hunt is an action game in which the player controls a skier driving down a 30 km slope. There are two distinct stages: During the first, the player simply has to dodge incoming obstacles (trees) and points are awarded for every kilometer. During the second stage, the obstacles are replaced by animals (e.g. deer or wolves), the player gets a gun and points are awarded for shootings. The player character can move freely during both. The two stages alternate and become faster over time.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Home Vision", "publishers": "Home Vision", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78426\n"}
