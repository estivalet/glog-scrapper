You need that fuel before you run out but watch out for colliding with that sun. You start on the screen with the artificial sun bouncing around and a fuel item on the right.

You can accelerate by pressing your button.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "December 4, 2005", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "JessCREATIONS", "publishers": "AtariAge", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD9TyQctBKU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113649\n"}
