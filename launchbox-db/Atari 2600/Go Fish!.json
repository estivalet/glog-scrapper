{"altername_name": [], "name": "Go Fish!", "overview": "Go Fish! is an original game loosely based on the Intellivision game Shark! Shark! - you are a wee fish and, to survive, you must eat other, smaller fish to grow. But watch out for the shark, as he's also on the hunt for food and you could be his next meal! Go Fish! features extensive, continuously-playing music (with an option to turn it off for those who'd rather do their fishing in quiet), as well as a two-player battle mode.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "2005", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bob Montgomery", "publishers": "Atari Age", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wtfBxs7gfM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/112465\n"}
