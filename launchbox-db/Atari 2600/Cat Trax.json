{"altername_name": ["Cat N Mouse"], "name": "Cat Trax", "overview": "It's an age-old battle of cats versus dogs. Take control of one brave cat and race through the maze, but beware--you're not alone! Dogs are lurking to find your cat and turn him into lunch! Race to the potion and transform into the Dog Catcher to impound those puppies...but watch out, they'll be back! It's a mad scramble in which you're out-numbered three to one. Can you out-run--and out-last--your canine opposition? Make CAT TRAX and find out! Cat Trax is a game originally written for the Emerson Arcadia 2001 by UA Ltd., and apparently slated to be released on the Atari 2600. While it was never commercially released by UA Ltd., it did appear on a European multi-cart under the name Cat N Mouse. It's unknown why this game (and the other UA prototypes) were never released commercially. Cat Trax is available in cartridge form from the AtariAge Store and includes a professionally printed box, manual and label, with artwork created by Dave Exton.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "UA Limited", "publishers": "UA Limited", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.32", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RWv-zL2IcM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/46227\n"}
