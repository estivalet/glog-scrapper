{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ultra SCSIcide", "overview": "In Ultra SCSIcide, you find yourself in the internals of a hard drive, a world of ones and zeros. You have been chosen to control the hard drive read head. As different colored data bits scroll by on the hard drive platter, you need to quickly read them in the correct order before you suffer a buffer underflow and cause a hard drive crash. As you complete each level, the data scrolls by more and more quickly. The goal is to score as many points and reach the highest platter level as possible. How far can you go? Ultra SCSIcide is an enhanced version of SCSIcide, an original, fast-paced homebrew game released in 2001.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "2005", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Joe Grand", "publishers": "AtariAge", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113545\n"}
