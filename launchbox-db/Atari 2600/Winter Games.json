{"altername_name": [], "name": "Winter Games", "overview": "WINTER GAMES is a series of seven exciting competitive events. Up to eight players can enter this international contest, each choosing a country for which to compete (no two players can choose the same nation to represent). The object is to see your country come out on top. You'll compete in pure speed events like skating and in speed-and-control events like slalom, biathlon, bobsled and luge. You'll test your skill against competitors in distance and style events like ski jumping and hot dog skiing. You'll win by scoring the fastest time or by earning the most points. And the nation that wins the most events takes home the gold medal!", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "January 1, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Epyx, Inc.", "publishers": "Epyx, Inc.", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "8", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.59", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_Games", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hULt5cf_DU0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21573\n"}
