{"altername_name": [], "name": "Looping", "overview": "Based on the obscure 1981 Venture Line coin-op of the same name. It's unknown why Looping was never released since the game seems to be finished and was even advertised. One reason may be the high difficulty of the game which really takes away most of the fun. As the game title suggests, this game involves looping. By looping I mean that your plane can only move in circles instead up the normal up, down ,left, right movement of most games. By pushing up or down, your plane will begin to arch and start its loop (pushing left and right has no effect). Normally this wouldn't be a huge problem, but your plane also moves very VERY fast, so it's quite easy to crash into the ground or another obstacle before your can complete your loop. One interesting thing to note is that if your plane hits the top of the screen it will nosedive straight down. While at first this may seem like a major inconvenience, it can be used to your advantage if you're crafty enough.
