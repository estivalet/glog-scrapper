{"altername_name": [], "name": "Brik", "overview": "Brik is a version of the classic brick breaking genre of games for your Atari console, featuring multiple unique levels, bonuses and enemies. The object of the game is to use the bat at the bottom of the screen to keep the ball in play as you knock out bricks to score points. Using the joystick controller you can move the bat left or right. Pressing the fire button launches the ball towards the bricks. Move the bat left or right to keep the ball in play. If the ball passes the bat you will lose a life and the ball will be reset on the bat ready to start again. If you lose all four lives the game is over. Brik Each level is patrolled by an enemy. If the ball hits the enemy the enemy is destroyed, but the ball's angle will change and speed will temporarily be increased. Destroying a brick sometimes reveals a bonus hidden underneath it, which will then fall towards the bottom of the screen. These bonuses can be collected by your bat. Brik also includes Brik 180, a new twist on the classic brick breaking genre, featuring unique levels, dual bats, and a rotated play area. Brik 180 differs from similar games by the use of two bats, one at the left side of the screen and another at the right side. The player controls both bats simultaneously, requiring great skill and fast reactions. Brik includes game cartridge and eight-page, full-color manual. Brik supports both NTSC and PAL television formats.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "2014", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Repixel8", "publishers": "AtariAge", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.36", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0q8glG88Y4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/124380\n"}
