{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pizza Chef", "overview": "At its heart, Pizza Chef a memory/guessing game combined with a poorly programmed action game. The goal of the game is to correctly match up the proper kitchen utensil/food combination with the correct cooking pot before time expires. The overall concept has promise, but the execution is downright terrible. The game is separated into five different rooms: the dining room, the refrigerator, the kitchen, the storage room, and the trash room. Each room has it's own unique purpose and goal. This prototype is the only known NTSC prototype of Pizza Chef known to exist. The prototype was found with several other ZiMAG and Vidco prototypes. The carts with the handwritten stickers were sold by Pleasant Valley Video in Ohio.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Zimag", "publishers": "Never Published (Prototype)", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uoc5OtIEUTM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78525\n"}
