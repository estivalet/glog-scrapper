{"altername_name": ["The Entity"], "name": "Entity", "overview": "The Entity is an unreleased 20th Century Fox game based on a horror movie sharing the same name. It's odd that Fox decided to go forward with this project, given the movie's disturbing adult theme where a young woman is raped by a ghost. This could very well be why Fox didn't release the game, although the game itself has little in common with the movie's subject matter. The Entity was programmed by Mark Kline, who was responsible for two other unreleased Fox games, Pick Up and Look Ahead. The cart, box and manual are reproductions from 2003 with permission of programmer Mark Klein.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mark Klein", "publishers": "20th Century Fox", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.38", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I31w8vAiA64", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/82274\n"}
