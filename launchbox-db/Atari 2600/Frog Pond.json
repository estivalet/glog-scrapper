{"altername_name": [], "name": "Frog Pond", "overview": "Frog Pond is a games that Atari never officially released to the public. 2 different versions exist with this - one with a \"rainbow\" title screen, and one with a detailed graphics screen (most likely the final version). An even earlier (work-in-progress) version was shown at the Summer 1982 CES show. Prototypes (and possibly copies) have been available for some time now. Best Electronics had it for $12 at one time. The game has nice, clean graphics. The game features nice, clean graphics, with 1 or 2 frogs on a lily pad. Each frog even has its own realistic \"ribbet\" sound. The object is to leap and catch as many insects as you can with your frog's tongue. Pressing the fire button shoots your frog's tongue out. The difficulty switches affect the length of your tongue (a little longer when set to B). There are four game variations: 1 and 3 are one-player versions; 2 and 4 are two-player versions. You are allowed so many misses-an insect will fly away if you fail to get it after a certain time limit. Games 3 and 4 allow more misses, but less time to get the insects. There are five types of insects. The game subject and total lack of difficulty shows this game was going to be aimed at small children, much like Nick Tuner's previous game Demons to Diamonds. This and the fact that it looked almost identical to Mattel's Frogs and Flies could have been the reason it was eventually not released. The cart, (green) box and manual are reproductions from 2004.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atari", "publishers": "Atari", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.44", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIPSkilaWI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/46257\n"}
