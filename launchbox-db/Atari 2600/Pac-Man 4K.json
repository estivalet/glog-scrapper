{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pac-Man 4K", "overview": "The DEFINITIVE home version of the arcade classic! Gobble your way through the maze of Pac-Land, chomping on dots and avoiding the four hungry monsters, Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Clyde. But if you can manage to eat an energizer, turn the tables on those monsters by feasting on them for bonus points! Dennis Debro sought to create an adaptation of Pac-Man more faithful than Atari's 1982 version for the VCS. Utilizing the same 4K memory limit as the original, Dennis' game is a feat of programming that finally brings Pac-Man to the Atari 2600 as it was intended. Improvements over Atari's Pac-Man Original, arcade maze layout Proper \"siren\" sound that changes pitch Monsters are proper colors Maze is correct colors Pac-Man and Ghost graphics much truer to arcade Monster behavior modeled after arcade Bonus items true to arcade Feels like Pac-Man!", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "2008", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "", "developers": "Dennis Debro", "publishers": "AtariAge", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.6", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/32714\n"}
