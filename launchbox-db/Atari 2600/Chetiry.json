{"altername_name": [], "name": "Chetiry", "overview": "The Soviet Union is crumbling, and so the most brilliant scientific minds have hatched a final master plan of world domination to save the republic. Their plan is the construction of a gigantic infernal machine, superior to all other weaponry. For the plan to succeed, vast quantities of steel beams are required. But the proletariat have become drunk on the smell of freedom and will only produce small twisted shapes of metal. Your job is to combine these feeble parts into large sturdy beams, so that the diabolical plan can be realized. Chetiry is a new puzzle game for the Atari 2600 console. The objective is to combine falling shapes of 4 squares (tetrominoes) into continuous horizontal lines of 10 squares, which will remove them from the grid. \"Chetiry\" is a loose translation of the Russian word \"Four\".", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "2012", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "", "developers": "Chris Walton, Zach Matley", "publishers": "AtariAge", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/124386\n"}
