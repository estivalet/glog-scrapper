Oh yeah, you also have a gun. :) Objective: when the two players fight for the puck, the highest player wins. The top and bottom of the playfield are fumble areas. The player with the puck moves slower. Deliver the puck to your goal to score, deliver it to the other players goal to give them a point. Loose a point if the other player scores. 4 points wins the match.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "John Reder", "publishers": "TACTICAL NEURONICS", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/124431\n"}
