{"altername_name": [], "name": "Star Fire", "overview": "This is a conversion of a 1980 Exidy coin-op game. It is a time of crisis for the Earth forces. Years of constant assault from the EXIDY coalition have left Earth almost totally defenseless. Intergalactic intelligence has discovered a new threat, several Exidy freighters, protected by an armada of smaller vessels, have entered a friendly sector of space and are advancing on Earth itself, loaded with enough weaponry to completely annihilate the planet. You are Earth's only hope. Aim your cross hair onto an enemy ship and press the button to fire. Try to shoot as many enemies as you can. Once you destroy all the enemies in a sector, a warp gate appears. Shoot it to warp to the next sector. Whenever your ship gets a direct hit from enemy fire, your shield loses energy. To restore shield energy look out for, and shoot, energy diamonds.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "August 7, 2003", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Xype", "publishers": "AtariAge", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXYb1eASBZc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113592\n"}
