The evil Dark Lord Kram, along with his army of Undead Soldiers and three ferocious Dragons, has kidnapped Princess Robyn and caged her twenty-six floors down into the very dark underworld of the Catacomb. You must rescue the Princess and defeat the Dark Lord. In each level, your goal is to explore the entire floor, clear the many rooms and corridors of enemies, collect the items left behind, and find the ladder down to the next level.
