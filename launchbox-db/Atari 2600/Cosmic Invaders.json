{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cosmic Invaders", "overview": "You control your ship at the bottom of the screen and battle the invading aliens marching across the screen. You can move sideways and fire at the invaders. There are three defenses that you can hide behind, but they will quickly get shot to pieces by the invaders, or maybe your own firing. From time to time, an UFO will fly across the top of the screen. Shoot it for extra points. An extra feature compared to the \"classics\" is the shield and the hyperspace. You can control the shield using and activate hyperspace by using a second joystick. The shield is a small line positioned just above your defenses. You can shoot through the shield, but the invaders cannot.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "2008", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Neotokeo2001", "publishers": "Neo Games", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uR_0BNTCxR0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/88637\n"}
