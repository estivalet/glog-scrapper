{"altername_name": [], "name": "I Project", "overview": "Congratulations! Your mission was a success! You, your helicopter and the other two helicopters of your squadron did very well and fought the enemy's army bravely. Your new objective sounds easy: escape the enemy territory and return to your home carrier. Due to fuel shortage you have to take the shortest way which follows a river flowing through a long canyon heading directly to the sea. Unfortunately all your ammunition is depleted and so you have to avoid colliding with objects just by your flying skills! Good luck, pilots! Your helicopter is able to fly at three levels of height. The dangerous objects in your way are fences, bars, homing missiles and columns. You either have to fly aside the columns, above the fences or above or below the bars. The missile can only be disarmed by the frequency scanner and your fire button. There is no direct score in I Project, but your progress can be judged by the entered zone and remaining distance. The game consists of 31 zones to pass. The game ends when all three helicopters of your team are destroyed or when you manage to finish the final zone.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "2008", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Simon Quernhorst", "publishers": "Self-Published", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/122878\n"}
