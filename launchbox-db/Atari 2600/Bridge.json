{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bridge", "overview": "You have in your possession the ultimate solitaire bridge game! Bridge by ACTIVISION deals you hundreds of millions of hands at random, provides a computer partner who bids by rules, and even plays as your opponents after you've established a contract. You can play the same hand over and over again until you're satisfied or keep dealing until you find a hand you want to play. Best of all, you'll never again be without a game with Bridge by ACTIVISION. Look inside to see how it's done. A NOTE TO BEGINNING BRIDGE PLAYERS: Bridge by ACTIVISION was designed for people who already know how to play the game. It won't teach you the basics - you'll want to read a good instructional book or take some classes for that. But it will give you virtually unlimited opportunities to practice what you learn and sharpen your game - at your own pace.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "December 1, 1980", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Larry Kaplan", "publishers": "Activision", "genres": "Casino", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.32", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hu2fthFxB4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21508\n"}
