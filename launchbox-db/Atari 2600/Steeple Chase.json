{"altername_name": ["Steeplechase"], "name": "Steeple Chase", "overview": "Not to be confused with Steeplechase published by Atari three years earlier, Steeple Chase is a horse racing game where the goal is to jump over a series of obstacles in as little time as possible. The top portion of the screen gives you an overhead layout of the race track, including obstacle locations and width. The side view gives you the height of the obstacles. For most barriers you need to consult both maps simultaneously.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Video Gems", "publishers": "Video Gems", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/118027\n"}
