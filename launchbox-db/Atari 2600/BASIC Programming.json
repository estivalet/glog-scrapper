{"altername_name": ["BASIC"], "name": "BASIC Programming", "overview": "BASIC Programming is an Atari 2600 cartridge that teaches simple computer programming. It was released in 1979 and was one of only a few non-gaming cartridges designed for the console. The programming language is similar to dialects of BASIC. Up to nine lines of programming code could be entered in a basic-esque programming language, using both of the Atari 2600 keypad controllers. Due to a 64 character limitation, and the Atari's own RAM size of 128 bytes, only extremely simple programs could be written and executed. Intended as a learning tool, BASIC Programming was not intended for serious programming, indeed, there is no way to permanently store a program once written, as the Atari lacks recordable media.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1979", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Warren Robinett", "publishers": "Atari", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.12", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC_Programming", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/114703\n"}
