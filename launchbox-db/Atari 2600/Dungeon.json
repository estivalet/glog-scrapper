{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dungeon", "overview": "The princess has been kidnapped and you must rescue her! Kill the demon who commands the forces of darkness and his legions that dwell in the sprawling Dungeon beneath the mountaintop castle. To aid you in your quest you will be equipped with a sword, shield and the tattered remains of an old map left behind by other brave adventurers...those who have never returned from the Dungeon to tell their tales. Dungeon is a turn-based assault in a dark and dangerous multi-level labyrinth! Along the way you'll encounter a variety of creatures hell-bent on your destruction. Aiding you in your quest is your spell book, chests containing magical items, and many wonders hidden in the dark depths of the dungeon. Can you rescue the princess and make it out alive, or will you be the dungeon's latest permanent resident?", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "2009", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "David Weavil", "publishers": "AtariAge", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/88629\n"}
