{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ikari Warriors", "overview": "You are a member of those elite combat specialists, the Ikari Warriors. Your buddy and you are on a special mission behind enemy lines, and you've been sleeping, eating, and breathing jungle combat for the last two weeks. Your tired, but that never affect your razor-sharp judgement and your will to survive. Your main weapons are machine guns, grenades, and your own cunning in the face of danger. Sometimes you'll have a tank at your disposal, which comes in handy when enemy fire is particularly brutal. You move swiftly through the jungle, wading through rivers and resting from time to time with the ruins of bombed-out buildings. You're turning out of ammunition and grenades but you know the battle can't last forever. Sooner or later, one side is going to emerge victorious. Let's just hope it's yours!", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dan Kitchen", "publishers": "Atari Corporation", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikari_Warriors", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLCy-s8k1UY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21525\n"}
