{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cathouse Blues", "overview": "This is a doubled-ended cartridge with Philly Flasher on one end and Cathouse Blues on the other. Philly Flasher is a graphically altered version of Beat 'Em & Eat 'Em with guys (or a guy) doing the catching and what they are catching looks to be milk from a witch's tit. The game plays just like Beat 'Em & Eat 'Em otherwise except the guy(s) masturbate after each round. In Cathouse Blues, you are a horny guy who has to memorize which 7 houses the ladies of ill repute wander into. Grab some cash from the teller, and visit each woman. A visit will cost $20, at which time you'll find yourself in her bed. Score with her as many times as you can before you're forced to leave for the next. The cops are in pursuit as well as a mugger who wants your money. Visiting a wrong house will cause you to be temporarily immobilized (a sitting duck for the cops) as you figure out what to do next. The roles of the men and women are switched in Gigolo.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "October 1, 1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Playaround", "publishers": "PlayAround", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.21", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDXYZhN0Pks", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/31737\n"}
