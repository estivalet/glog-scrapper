{"altername_name": ["Lunar Excursion Module", "L.E.M.: Lunar Excursion Module"], "name": "L.E.M.", "overview": "In the 1960s the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) launched the Apollo program with the goal of landing a man on the Moon before the end of the decade. This goal was first accomplished during the Apollo 11 mission on July 20, 1969 when astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed, while Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit. The L.E.M. (Lunar Excursion Module) was the lander portion of the Apollo spacecraft and was built by Grumman. Along with the Command Module, the L.E.M. was launched into space atop a Saturn V rocket. In space, the two craft docked and traveled to the Moon. Once in orbit of the Moon, the craft separated and the L.E.M. ferried two astronauts to the Moon\u2019s surface. When the astronauts completed their mission on the Moon, the craft separated from its landing struts and returned to space to connect with the Command Module for the trip back to Earth. The L.E.M. was a well built craft that never failed in any mission assigned to it.
