Now one of the most sought-after Atari 2600 prototypes is finally available. What's the story, you ask? Way back in 1983 Parker Brothers featured this game in one of their catalogs.

Lord of the Rings was never released, and Parker Brothers reportedly informed people that called and asked for the game that it was sold out in an attempt to cover up for the fact that it was never published.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mark Lesser", "publishers": "Parker Brothers", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.21", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/34472\n"}
