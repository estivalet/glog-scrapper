{"altername_name": [], "name": "Scuba Diver", "overview": "Jump out of the boat and try to harpoon the fish without being eaten. You've only got one shot. If you miss, you'll have to wait for the harpoon to return, during which time you'll be fish food. When you capture all of the fish, enter the sunken ship and attempt to retrieve the treasures while avoiding a bunch of sea creatures. You've got enough air for 60 seconds of swimming before you must return to the surface.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sancho", "publishers": "Panda", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKXjqTOBZBI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/41029\n"}
