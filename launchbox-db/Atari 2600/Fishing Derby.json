{"altername_name": ["Fishing", "Schneller Als der Hai", "Angling"], "name": "Fishing Derby", "overview": "In Fishing Derby, your goal is to be the first of two players to catch 99 pounds of fish. Each player is on a dock at the top of the screen, and you control the fishing line in the water. By moving the fishing line up or down, you can catch the fish that are swimming by. The deeper down you go, the bigger the fish are. When you catch a fish, you need to real it in! To make the game more difficult, a shark is constantly swimming back and forth. If you have a fish on your line and it touches the shark, the shark will eat it and you then will have to catch another fish. Two difficulty levels are available, and the game can be played by one person against the computer or two players against each other.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "July 1, 1980", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Activision", "publishers": "Activision", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.44", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing_Derby", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xsiqihJYBs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/19664\n"}
