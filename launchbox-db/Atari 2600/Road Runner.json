{"altername_name": [], "name": "Road Runner", "overview": "In Road Runner, the player takes control of the Road Runner. The Road Runner must run along the road, avoiding trucks, landmines, falling rocks, etc. and also not get caught by Wile E. Coyote. The Road Runner must also eat birdseed along the way or he will become faint and Wile E. will catch him. The Road Runner can earn points for eating the birdseed and also by making Wile E. get hit by trucks, falling rocks, etc. The Atari 2600 version has a difference from the other versions, in that the Road Runner isn't required to eat the birdseed but can do so for the points.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atari Games", "publishers": "Atari Corporation", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.57", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/33174\n"}
