{"altername_name": ["Kampf dem Steinfresser", "Crab Control", "Boom Bang", "Boom Bang", "Boom Bang", "Boom Bang"], "name": "Crackpots", "overview": "A barrage of bugs are attacking your home, and you need to defend it with potted plants! You control your character at the top of the screen where there are six potted plants. These can be dropped on the bugs to destroy them as they make their way up from the sewer at the bottom. Just beneath the potted plants are six windows; you need to make sure you destroy the bugs before they can reach these windows. If six of the bugs make it into the windows, a layer of your house will be eaten. This will drop you one step closer to the bottom of the screen, making it more difficult to destroy the incoming bugs! There are four different color bugs in the game, each of which have a different pattern of movement. As the levels progress, bugs will keep coming faster and faster! The game ends when six layers of the building have been eaten.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dan Kitchen", "publishers": "Activision", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.74", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crackpots", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1M8wG2pwrw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21513\n"}
