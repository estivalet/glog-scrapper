{"altername_name": [], "name": "Warplock", "overview": "Taking aim at the tormentors swarming outside your space craft's main View Port, you must destroy the space bandits' ships before they get you. At the same time, you must avoid the Photon Bombs with which some of your attackers are equipped. With controller in hand, your job is to shoot the space pirates out of the sky. Your ship maneuvers horizontally near the bottom one-fourth of the screen, and you can hold the fire button to fire continuously, or you can shoot one energy rod at a time. The space pirates' ships can maneuver in any direction all around the screen (including under your ship), but you can only shoot vertically. The enemy ships appear one at a time or in groups of two or three. If you hit any of the three ships in a group, the entire wave is eliminated. For every ship you hit, you get one point. When you reach 16 points, the pirates begin dropping photon bombs. When you earn 99 points, your score starts over again at zero.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Data Age", "publishers": "Data Age", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.19", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc0XDOUFOPI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/43941\n"}
