{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bouncin' Baby Bunnies", "overview": "Zounds! Coco the crazy monkey is in quite a pickle this time! Dr. Storkus Z. Hopperdropper (Storky, to his friends) has gone a bit mad, and is dropping baby bunnies from the sky! In fact, it's raining bunnies! What's a crazy monkey to do? Get help, that's what! Coco and his brother Haggis are out to catch the bunnies and bounce 'em to safety. It's monkey business, for sure, and they need your help, so grab that trampoline, and start Bouncin' Baby Bunnies!! A copy of the nearly complete game surfaced in the collection of a former Telesys employee in 2007. According to programmer Alex Leavens, Bouncin' Baby Bunnies is based off the old Bugs Bunny cartoon, where the stork mistakenly delivers Bugs to a gorilla family and they think he's their baby. The only known prototype of Bouncin' Baby Bunnies seems to be fairly complete, but still needs some tweaks and bug fixes. The game didn't get released because of the collapsing game market of 83/84. According to the former Telesys employee: 'Bouncin' Baby Bunnies came too late in the 2600 cycle and, at the time, wasn't worth releasing. The market was saturated.'", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Alex Leavens", "publishers": "Unreleased Prototype", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.7", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQjSkvdgtJk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/108096\n"}
