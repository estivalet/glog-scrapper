{"altername_name": [], "name": "Thrust+: Platinum Edition", "overview": "XYPE programmers Thomas Jentzsch and Paul Slocum have joined forces up to create Thrust+ Platinum, an updated version of Thomas Jentzsch's Atari 2600 port of the Commodore 64 classic, which itself took cues from the Atari coin-op game Gravitar. Thrust+ Platinum is now enhanced with a great title theme (listen to it here) composed by Rob Hubbard (who created the original theme for the Commodore 64 version), and adapted to the 2600 by Paul Slocum. Several additional audio enhancements have been added as well, bringing still further polish to what was already one of the finest homebrew games on the 2600. Additionally, a new label and manual have been designed by David Exton, who has been the creative force behind artwork gracing many popular homebrew games.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "2003", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Thomas Jentzsch", "publishers": "AtariAge", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113546\n"}
