{"altername_name": [], "name": "Fire Fly", "overview": "After your interplanetary craft accidentally enters a black hole, you find yourself in a different universe. This world is inhabited by strange, mechanical bug-like creatures. You find that this world contains both bad and good bugs; the good bugs have asked for your help, and you agree to defend them. Your first challenge is to rescue the Pixy; this is the last living creature on the planet and is guarded by a killer bee. Should you succeed, you next will need to fight off a variety of enemy creatures including a flaming pumpkin, demons, and coiled serpents. Each time you defeat the creatures on the screen, you can move to the right where a new challenge (and bonus) awaits! After you complete all of the screens of bad bugs, then the game repeats at a tougher difficulty level.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bruce de Graaf", "publishers": "Mythicon", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "0.65", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPoIcULs6YI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21579\n"}
