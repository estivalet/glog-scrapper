These nuclear bases are guarded by a protective force field and two deadly Core Ranger Tanks. You must be able to quickly maneuver your Core Capsule so that you can avoid or destroy the enemy tanks, strip away the force field, and blast the atomic bases with your laser fire. But you must hurry! You only have a limited amount of time to complete each round or you'll begin to lose your Reserve Core Capsules. So, get ready for thundering action as the pace becomes fast and furious. And, make sure to prepare yourself for a few unexpected surprises!", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/28805\n"}
