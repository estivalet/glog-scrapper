{"altername_name": [], "name": "Miss It!", "overview": "Miss It is a one player game where the object is to keep your square away from all the other objects that are bouncing around the screen. It starts out easy at first with only one square to avoid. Soon there are two squares to avoid, then three squares, then four, and then five. Each new square that appears is preceded by a warning beep. Later on in the game small rectangles come out instead of squares. The rectangles are harder to see and more challenging to avoid. The longer the game goes on the crazier it gets. The game ends when you are touched by one of the objects.
