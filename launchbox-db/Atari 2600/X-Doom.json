{"altername_name": [], "name": "X-Doom", "overview": "A ROM hack from Thiago Paiva aka the X-Doomer originally based on Megamania, a frenetic shoot 'em up that pits the player against a variety of household objects (tires, dice, hamburgers, bow ties, and more) gone berzerk. These objects attack in different formations, many of which pass through the player's field of movement at the bottom of the screen. Most of these objects also drop bombs in an attempt to destroy the player's oversized cannon, making these stages even more difficult. Players can take advantage of the game's bonus system by allowing a cannon to be lost just before reaching 10,000 points (when an extra life is awarded), and then finishing off the remaining objects from the current wave. This allows more of the time remaining from that wave to be converted to points.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "2012", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Thiago Paiva", "publishers": "", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3omzdb", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/127124\n"}
