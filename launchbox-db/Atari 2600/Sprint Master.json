{"altername_name": ["Sprintmaster"], "name": "Sprint Master", "overview": "Sprint Master is an action racing game similar to Super Sprint. The game is played with an overhead view of the racetrack, and the first of two players to race around the track for the required number of laps wins! Occasionally a bonus will appear in the roadway; collect these to increase the traction capabilities of your car or gain a temporary speed boost. Other obstacles, such as oil slicks, may also appear in the roadway which will cause you to lose control and speed. There is a total of nine different tracks with varying levels of difficulty to race on, and you can choose either blacktop, dirt, or ice for terrain.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "December 1, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Robert C.
