{"altername_name": ["Bachelorette Party: Burning Desire", "Jungle Fever"], "name": "Burning Desire", "overview": "Rescue a damsel in distress from being burned alive by moving around in your helicopter and putting out the flame with your fire hose. Meanwhile, avoid the rocks being thrown at you by the bad dudes. When you've nearly extinguished the flames, the woman will begin jumping up and down. If you swoop down, she'll latch on to your \"joystick\" with her mouth, and you can fly her off to safety before the flames move in on her. If you save her, you will be rewarded with a dirty little animation. The male and female roles of this game are switched in Jungle Fever.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "October 1, 1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Joel H.
