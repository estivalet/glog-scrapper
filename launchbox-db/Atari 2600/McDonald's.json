{"altername_name": ["McDonald's: Golden Arches Adventure"], "name": "McDonald's", "overview": "The existing prototype uses the Tutankham game code. As such, PARKERBROS 83DAVEENGMAN can be found at the very end of the compiled code listing, along with a few of the Tutankham explorer graphics. Also, the characters 0123456789, ABCDEFTWV, and PLAY are in the code. Although McDonald's is far from finished, the game's designer Isabel Garret was able to give us the details on how the game would have been played: 'You are Ronald McDonald flying in your spaceship. Hungry aliens are descending on the Golden Arches below to eat them. You must fly down to the ground and pick up McDonald's food to bring up and feed the aliens, but certain aliens will only eat certain McDonald's fast food (shakes, fries, hamburgers) so you need to feed them the right food. If you don't feed them in time, they start to eat the Golden Arches, but not to worry, you can fly back down to the ground and pick up pieces to rebuild the Golden Arches'.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dave Engman", "publishers": "Never Published (Prototype)", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.6", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78464\n"}
