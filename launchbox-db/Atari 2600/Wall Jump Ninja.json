Today you will learn the legendary technique of the \"wall jump\". Use it wisely, or face certain doom at the hands of the death beam. To play, first adjust the difficulty switches to your liking. The Left difficulty switch toggles LAVA On/Off. When lava is off, you can use your teleport ability to zip back t o the top of the wall if you slide too low. The Right difficulty switch toggles HARD mode on On/Off. Hard mode makes spikes and other obstacles appear much sooner.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "2015", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Walaber", "publishers": "AtariAge", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrWeQcUHwjM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/166089\n"}
