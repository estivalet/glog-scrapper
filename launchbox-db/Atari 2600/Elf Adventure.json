Yes it appears that Warren was tinkering with a sequel to his smash hit Adventure in his spare time while working at The Learning Company which he founded in 1980 after leaving Atari. It\u2019s unknown if Atari actually ordered a sequel or if Warren was doing this on his own and hoping to sell it to Atari.

Either way, this prototype has an air of mystery about it.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Warren Robinett", "publishers": "Never Published (Prototype)", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlaOPd015mc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/82273\n"}
