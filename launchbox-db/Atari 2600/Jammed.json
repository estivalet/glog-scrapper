{"altername_name": [], "name": "Jammed", "overview": "You want to steal your dream car. But first you must get those other clunkers out of the way. Jammed is a shifting-pieces puzzle similar to the board game Rush Hour where you are trying to move the white rectangles out of the way so the yellow car has a clear path to the exit. Place the circle cursor onto the end of a white or yellow car and if it changes from a pink circle with a minus sign to a blue circle with an arrow, you can press the button to move the car. Try to free the yellow car in the fewest moves.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "December 12, 2002", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Thomas Jentzsch", "publishers": "AtariAge", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEGrQkQmZyk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78557\n"}
