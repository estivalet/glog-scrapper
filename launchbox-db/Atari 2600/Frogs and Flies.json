{"altername_name": ["Grenouilles et Mouches"], "name": "Frogs and Flies", "overview": "You control one of two frogs sitting on a lily pad in a bog. The object of the game is to eat as many flies as you can in the three minute time limit. Your frog can jump back and forth between the two lily pads in order to catch the flies that go by overhead. When jumping, be careful not to fall in the water or your frog will have to swim back to the lily pad, which can waste time. In the Intellivision version, the game can be played during the day, or at night, making it more difficult to see the flies. In the Atari 2600 version, the game is only played during the day and, when the sun goes down, the game is over. At the end of the time limit, whichever player has eaten more flies wins! One player can compete against a computer controlled frog, or two players against each other.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "APh Technological Consulting", "publishers": "Mattel Electronics", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.42", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogs_and_Flies", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0rK-e21RdU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/17976\n"}
