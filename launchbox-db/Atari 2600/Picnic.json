{"altername_name": [], "name": "Picnic", "overview": "You are out enjoying a picnic, when suddenly a swarm of flies arrive! You control a fly swatter at the bottom of the screen; your goal in this game is to protect your hamburgers (located on the left and right bottom of the screen) from the attacking flies. When a fly is close enough, it will stick out its tongue to eat the food. If you can swat the fly right when it has its tongue out, it will be knocked out and fall into your fly trap. When all of the flies have been knocked into the trap, you will then need to face a large super fly before the level is complete (be careful, it can eat your food fast!) After knocking out the super fly, you move on to the next round. The game ends when all of your hamburgers have been completely eaten. Set both difficulty switches to B and set the TV type switch to Black & White. Power the game up and play variation #1. When the game ends, push Left on the right Joystick. The player 1's score will change to DAVID J. and the player 2\u2019s score will change to DONNA F.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Western Technologies Inc.", "publishers": "U.S. Games", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.6", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lJwUGUYWQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21534\n"}
