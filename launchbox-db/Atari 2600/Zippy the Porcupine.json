{"altername_name": [], "name": "Zippy the Porcupine", "overview": "One day an airship came to visit Zippy's happy, little, peaceful land. Curious, Zippy took a peek inside and was overwhelmed with all sorts of gadgets and things that he had never seen before. After a long while of exploring, Zippy found a nice place inside to take a nap. After his nap, he left the ship but found that he was in a whole other land! The ship must have taken off to this new place while he was sleeping. But before he could think of what to do to get back to his home, he noticed someone exiting the ship, riding a smaller air vehicle. This moustached man looked strange to him, but his appearance was the least of Zippy's worries, as he noticed that on the vehicle were the five power gems from his home! He must have stolen them! Those gems can be dangerous in the wrong hands! Now it's up too Zippy to get them back and return them to their rightful place.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "August 11, 2014", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Chris Spry", "publishers": "AtariAge", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/84762\n"}
