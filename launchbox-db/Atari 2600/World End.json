{"altername_name": [], "name": "World End", "overview": "The End of the World is a single-screen shooter. A big alien station, which occupies the top part of the screen, attacks a planet. The player controls a laser base which tries to repel the attacks. Said laser base is bound to the bottom of the screen and can be moved horizontally as well as shoot lasers (one at the time) towards the enemy. The alien station itself is outside the laser's reach, and so are the two robots it releases during each round. Those move around the screen and shoot three kinds of projectiles downwards: destroyer probes (should be shot for 100 points), spiders (must be shot because if one reaches the ground, one of the five lives is lost) and laser rays (must be avoided because they are deadly by touch). After 5000 points are reached, a new round with higher difficulty starts: the robots are faster and the playing field is reduced left and right. The goal is to reach the highest score possible before the inevitable defeat. The two-player mode is alternating and features no player interaction besides comparing the scores.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Home Vision", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83262\n"}
