{"altername_name": [], "name": "Thrust+: D.C. Edition", "overview": "Homebrew games seem to have a special feel to them. I've always thought that the extra effort that goes into a title born of passion for a particular genre or console really shows when playing such a game. Thrust is regarded as one of the best homebrew games for the Atari 2600. Loosely based on Gravitar, Thrust offeres amazing control, great game play and insane difficulty. The cover above is actually from Thrust+ (i believe) released in 2002 with support for a wide variety of controllers. The difficulty of Thrust doesn't impede on the fun of the game. It's control is so good, it's difficulty is an attribute as one masters the best way to handle situations as gravity pulls you downward. Thrust Story Arc: The Intergalactic Empire has captured several battle-grade starships in reparation for an attack by the resistance. Their weakness is an inability to power these starships, called Klystron Pods. As a member of the resistance, your job is to steal the Klystron Pods from the Empire's storage planets. The planets are heavily armed and well defended by Limpet guns. These guns can be taken out by firing on their reactors. This will temporarily disable the guns, but too many shots will cause a critical state in the reactor - blowing up the planet. If the planet explodes before you retrieve the pod it will be destroyed in the explosion rendering your mission a failure. If you already have the pod and can escape prior to the reactor reaches a critical phase, you are generously rewarded with bonus points.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "2002", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Xype", "publishers": "Atari Age", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113547\n"}
