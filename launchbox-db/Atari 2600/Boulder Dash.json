{"altername_name": [], "name": "Boulder Dash", "overview": "Following the recent release of their amazing Boulder Dash\u00ae playable demo, programmers Andrew Davie and Thomas Jentzsch, in association with publishers AtariAge and First Star Software, Inc, are very excited to announce that the original game in the Boulder Dash\u00ae series, Boulder Dash\u00ae Volume 1, will be available for purchase, exclusively from the AtariAge Store, in time for Christmas 2011! Andrew Davie and Thomas Jentzsch have been working on this Atari 2600 port of Boulder Dash\u00ae for almost a decade. Together these two Atari 2600 veterans have used their insight and sophisticated knowledge about the Atari console to bring to life a faithful rendering of the classic, action-puzzle game (first released on the Atari 8-bit computer platform in 1984) from First Star Software, Inc. Game-play, sounds, and graphics have been faithfully reproduced, culminating in a game for the Atari 2600 unlike any previously seen.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "2012", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Andrew Davie", "publishers": "AtariAge", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYH9MUDZaJg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/59839\n"}
