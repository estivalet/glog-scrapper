Earn points for each event. Highest final score wins! Up to four players compete in the ten different events of a real-life decathlon, either in sequence or individually. The game became somewhat notorious for the amount of wear or damage inflicted upon console controllers, where rapid back-and-forth movement of the joystick propels the athlete down the track.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "David Crane", "publishers": "Activision, Inc.", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.85", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Activision_Decathlon", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xrHtgYvgtM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/8897\n"}
