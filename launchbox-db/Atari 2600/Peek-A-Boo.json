{"altername_name": [], "name": "Peek-A-Boo", "overview": "Since Peek-A-Boo was intended for very young children the gameplay is very simple. The main character of this game (a cat named Smart Seymour) moves in and out from behind a square. Depending on the game selected the various elements of the game change slightly. The square may be a single block, a rectangle, or four colored squares. The cat may move far away from the square, or he may barely move half his body out. The cat may move rapidly in and out from behind the square, or he may stay behind the square. There are eight different types of games, each with a slightly different objective.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kevin Sacher", "publishers": "Atari", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.12", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=833Kf2a9bgo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78405\n"}
