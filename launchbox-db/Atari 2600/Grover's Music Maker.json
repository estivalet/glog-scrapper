{"altername_name": [], "name": "Grover's Music Maker", "overview": "Grover's Music Maker was originally called Monkey Music and featured a dancing monkey instead of Grover. Grover's Music Maker was an attempt by Atari to introduce children to the music through some well known (and some not so well known) children's tunes. Selecting one of the twenty letters (A -T), will cause Grover to start jumping around while some music is played in the background. It's unknown why the game got canned, but it may be due to Atari pulling the plug on the 2600 Children's series after its less than stellar performance. Other reasons may have been poor beta testing results or limited long term playability.
