{"altername_name": ["Home Run: Baseball", "Baseball"], "name": "Home Run", "overview": "Home Run is a 1978 sports video game developed and published by Atari for the Atari 2600. It was the first baseball-themed game released for an Atari platform. The game only vaguely resembles actual baseball as it lacks fly balls or independent fielders. Teams have only one to three players, and the fielders must run with the ball to tag players out, with throwing of the ball to force players out not being possible. There is no pitcher's mound, with the pitcher instead standing at second base. Depending on the selected game mode, only zero to two infielders are present in the game, and when either the pitcher or one of the infielders catches the ball everyone but the baserunners and the ball-catcher instantly disappears from view. The home team has to bat at the bottom of the 9th inning regardless of whether they are winning or not, and there is no extra innings if the game is tied.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1978", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atari", "publishers": "Atari", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.6", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Run_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5bKhQuzysM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/8888\n"}
