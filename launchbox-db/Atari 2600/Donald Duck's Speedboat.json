{"altername_name": [], "name": "Donald Duck's Speedboat", "overview": "Donald has entered the Duckburg boat race and has taken to the sea with his speedboat. The objective is to steer the boat away from the obstacles along the way to the finish line and do so as fast as possible without losing pressure on the throttle. The game takes place across multiple screens which each presents its own obstacle patterns and challenges. Donald Duck's Speedboat was ready for release before being cancelled for reasons unknown. It was cancelled so late in fact that a prototype box and several screenshots had already been shown in European Atari 2600 catalogs. Speculation is that the Children's line-up wasn't selling as well as Atari had hoped, and they pulled the plug on the whole operation.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Peter C.
