{"altername_name": [], "name": "Innerspace (Venture Vision)", "overview": "Innerspace was the sequel to VentureVision\u2019s Rescue Terra I. In fact, there were actually three games planned for the 'Terra I Trilogy', although only the first two were released. The first game, called Rescue Terra I, had you traveling through an onslaught of aliens and asteroids to reach the planet of Terra I. The second game, called Innerspace, has you travel through planetary tunnels to destroy the computer system and return control to the Terra I colonists. The third and final game of the Trilogy, called Solar Defense, had you defending solar reactors around the earth while the Terra I colonists supplied them with Zenbar crystals. Having all three games linked together with a storyline (as thin as it was) was a novel idea at the time, but sadly it was not to be. While VentureVision was able to release their first game, they went under before the second or third could be released. Imagic picked up Innerspace and released it as Laser Gates, but Solar Defense remained unreleased. You have reached Terra I and must now fight your way to a centralized computer system located at the planet's core. The objective of the game is to destroy the computer system and return control of the planet to the colonists. Your task will involve a great deal of skill and an element of luck.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dan Oliver", "publishers": "Venture Vision", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.62", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/122879\n"}
