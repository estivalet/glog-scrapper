{"altername_name": [], "name": "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial", "overview": "The object of the game is to find pieces of E.T.'s phone. Once all pieces are found, E.T. calls home and the spaceship arrives to pick him up. E.T. can collect Reese's Pieces scattered around in order to regain energy which is constantly depleted with time. The phone pieces are in some of the pits, and E.T. must jump in to get them; sometimes there's also a dead flower in the pit which provides extra points if brought back to life. Once E.T. has done his business in the pit, to get out he must levitate his way out, though he must watch out not to fall into the pit again after leaving. Evil scientists and agents wander around the area, trying to capture E.T. and steal the parts he's carrying.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Howard Scott Warshaw", "publishers": "Atari", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.87", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.T._the_Extra-Terrestrial_%28video_game%29", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u29Fsof2WLM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/7312\n"}
