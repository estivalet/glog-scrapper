But one thing\u2019s for sure, PANAMA JOE\u2019s a daredevil from the word \u201cgo!\u201d No risk\u2019s too great if the reward\u2019s large enough. Winning. That\u2019s what\u2019s the most important to him. And more times than not, that\u2019s exactly what he does. Because he\u2019s tough, clever \u2013 resourceful. And sometimes, downright pig-headed! Though occasionally (ah-hum), he\u2019s been known to get in over his head. Luckily, he\u2019s got a knack for getting himself out of hot water as quickly as he gets into it! Let\u2019s hope MONTEZUMA\u2019S REVENGE is one of those times. When you enter the treasure room, keep pushing against the right side (where you came in) until the music stops \u2013 you won\u2019t fall through the floor. You\u2019ll then be able to collect as many treasures as you wish, but the curse is you can\u2019t exit this room.
