{"altername_name": ["3D Tic Tac Toe", "Tic Tac Toe", "Jogo da Velha 3D"], "name": "3-D Tic-Tac-Toe", "overview": "The game is similar to the traditional game of tic-tac-toe, but is played on four 4\u00d74 grids stacked vertically; it is basically a computerized version of the board game Qubic using traditional tic-tac-toe notation and layout. To win, a player must place four of their symbols on four squares that line up vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, on a single grid, or spaced evenly over all four grids. This creates a total of 76 possible ways to win, in comparison to eight possible ways to win on a standard 3\u00d73 board. The game has nine variations: it can be played by two players against each other, or one player can play against a built-in AI on one of eight different difficulty settings. The game uses the standard joystick controller.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "June 1, 1980", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atari", "publishers": "Atari", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.92", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-D_Tic-Tac-Toe", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dfWCkyf70Y", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/14194\n"}
