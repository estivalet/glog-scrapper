You can choose a new path at the bottom of the screen. Reaching a Minus: You loose 300 points. Return to the beginning of your chosen path to get new energy. Reaching a Plus: You gain 1000 points. Return to the beginning of your chosen path to get new energy. The flashing UFO's can be destroyed (500 points) by touching them. Reaching a Sword: You gain 500 points. The grid becomes invisible and all paths are walkable now. Return to the bottom of the screen to get new energy. The flashing UFO's can be destroyed (500 points) by touching them. When you get hit by a non-flashing UFO, you will loose 1 life. When you run out of energy, you will loose 1 life. Sometimes the paths change position and you will fall off and loose 1 life. Sometimes you can teleport from one vertical path to another. The game has a 2 player mode and 8 difficulty levels (the speed increases). This extremely rare game was found on a Mexican Atari 2600 clone, the 2600 Screen Search console (with 208 built-in games).", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Never Published (Prototype)", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2r_Gc33n7w", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113544\n"}
