{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sheep It Up!", "overview": "Sheep It Up! is an arcade game where a sheep has to climb up by hanging himself to flying velcro straps. Press the button to jump! While in air, you can use left/right to move the sheep. Jump on the velcro straps (i.e the flying black bars) to move higher and higher. The concept is simple, but the game rapidly gets quite challenging: how high can you climb without falling down? Sheep It Up! started jumping up on the Game Boy in 2017. Six months later, the creator of the original Game Boy game, Dr. Ludos, started to remake it for the Atari 2600. So now, you can challenge yourself to make a Sheep climb up in the sky with beautiful colors!", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "November 4, 2018", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dr. Ludos", "publishers": "AtariAge", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6PUC4T4s0Q", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/154074\n"}
