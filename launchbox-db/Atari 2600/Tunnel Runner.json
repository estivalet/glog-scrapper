{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tunnel Runner", "overview": "Tunnel Runner is a 3D Maze Game, essentially what a 1st person version of Pac-Man game would be like. Your primary goal is to locate and collect the hidden key, located in a different spot within each maze. Through the assistance of your map, you can maneuver within the maze. While attempting to locate the key to exit the level, you must also avoid enemies throughout the maze. Successfully recovering the key opens the portal to the next level. As you pass each level the complexity and difficulty increases, while your map gradually reveals less and less information.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "CBS Electronics", "publishers": "CBS Electronics", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnel_Runner", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21555\n"}
