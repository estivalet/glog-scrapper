{"altername_name": ["Miner 2049er: Starring Bounty Bob"], "name": "Miner 2049er", "overview": "You play the part of Bounty Bob, and it is your mission to explore every inch of an abandoned mine. As you walk over floor sections in the mine, the floor will change color. When all of the floor sections have been changed in color, you can move on to the next, more challenging level. To reach all of the floor sections, you will need to figure out how to get there. You can jump (be careful not to fall too far though, or you will be squished), climb up and down ladders, and use different transportation devices that can be found on the levels (such as an elevator, slides, a springboard, or a cannon). Wandering around the mine are numerous radioactive creatures which get in Bounty Bob's way. Also scattered throughout the mines are various artifacts left behind; if Bounty Bob collects one of these, the creatures will temporarily become vulnerable. If Bounty Bob runs into one of the creatures in this state the creature will be destroyed, but if he runs into a creature while it is glowing Bounty Bob will be destroyed. There is a total of ten different levels, and to complete them all you will need quick reflexes as well as to figure out a unique strategy for each level.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Big Five Software", "publishers": "Tigervision", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miner_2049er", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2PdPWhvBilg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/48707\n"}
