{"altername_name": [], "name": "Beany Bopper", "overview": "In this game, you are the character called Bopper. The object is to stun then capture Beanies. You can also capture Bouncing Orange Eyeballs and various Falling Objects. If an unstunned Beany touches you, you lose a life. You don't need to stun the other items to capture them but doing so makes them slow down. You get a bonus Bopper by shooting four Beanies in a row without losing a Bopper. There are two game options, one where the Beanies bounce off the walls on screen, the other where they pass through.", "platform": "Atari 2600", "release_date": "January 1, 1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Grady Ward", "publishers": "20th Century Fox", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.92", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DD_7Z1JUgx8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21505\n"}
