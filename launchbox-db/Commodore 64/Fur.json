{"altername_name": ["FUR"], "name": "Fur", "overview": "Fur is a conversion of an old game for the Altair 8800 (late 70's computer) to the C64. The original was developed by Marge Kosel, and the C64 conversion was done by Barry \"Cout\" Hart in 2005. In this text based trading game, you are a French fur trader. You have 190 pelts (in total per round) of four different kinds (Mink, Beaver, Ermine, and Fox) to trade at three specific trading forts. Fort 1 (Fort Hochelaga in Montreal) being the easiest (the quickest way to gather some $ before trying the harder trading posts), Fort 2 (Fort Stadacona in Quebec City) being harder, and finally Fort 3 (Fort New York), being the hardest.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2005", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Barry Hart", "publishers": "Cout Games", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/156924-fur\n"}
