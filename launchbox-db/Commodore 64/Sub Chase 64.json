{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sub Chase 64", "overview": "A VIC 20 Sub Chase remake for the Commodore 64 by Karsten Senkel. Features: 8 different enemies, 3 game modes for 1 or 2 player simultaneously, weapon upgrades, balanced difficulty curve and a highscore table. Game starts with 3 lives for each player. An extra life is provided every 10000 points. In cooperative mode there is a common life counter for both players, so a gained extra life can revive a previously eliminated player. At the beginning, every ship is equipped with 2 depth charge launchers and a shockwave bomb. By wrecking special targets, 3 additional launchers can be obtained, so that a maximum of 5 depth charges per player can be active at one time. If all possible launchers are in place, the destruction of more special targets will restore missing shockwave bombs. If these bombs are already present, shockwaves are triggered. Losing a life decreases the number of additional launchers. A new shockwave bomb is also provided with every new level.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "September 2, 2022", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Karsten Senkel", "publishers": "itch.io", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/170103-sub-chase-64\n"}
