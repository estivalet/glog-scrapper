{"altername_name": [], "name": "Legion of the Damned II", "overview": "After the defeat of the vampire tyrant Stryxia 1000 years ago, the folk of Hameria village erected a church over the place where she had fallen, partly as a gesture of triumph but mainly to prevent her from rising again. As the centuries rolled on, the village was eventually swallowed up in the growth of the neighboring town, which developed into a major city. Gang warfare became widespread, even into the city outskirts, and one gang set up its headquarters in the abandoned church. During an attack from a rival gang, blood was spilled over the ground in which Stryxia\u2019s bones still lay, waiting to absorb new life-force. Not only was the evil queen resurrected, but the blood gave her complete understanding of the crime-ridden modern world into which she had been reborn. Seizing her opportunity, Stryxia has taken control of the gangs, turning their members into an new army of vampire slaves who have enforced her sadistic will over the entire city. The authorities, which struggled to contain even the ordinary gangs, have been powerless to prevent them. However, two of the few surviving police officers \u2013 Detectives Starr and Michael \u2013 have a lead on where Stryxia herself is based, and know that if they can only fight their way through to her, they can eliminate the entire problem \u2026 assuming they survive the encounter. Three levels of relentless battle await you: the inner city, the industrial estate, and the city outskirts.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2009", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Anthony Burns", "publishers": "The New Dimension (TND)", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8N2EboCXiE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75936-legion-of-the-damned-ii\n"}
