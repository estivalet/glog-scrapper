HOTEL ENTRANCE - MORNING: A damp day, Hotel, somewhere in the countryside. It is about 08:00. Alain has no money to pay for the hotel bill. The Hotel owner locks Alain in in his room, and contacts the police via telephone. Alain makes his escape, via a window. To cover his modesty, Alain steals clothes off a washing line. With no keys to start his car, Alain makes a bid for freedom on foot. THE GAME: Alain has 3 attempts at getting his Scene right, or he is off the job. His task is straight forward enough. Start at the Hotel head towards Town, and return to the Hotel completing a loop. What could be simpler? For a start, there's all sorts to hinder Alain's progress Cats, Brats to name a few. Watch out for other surprises. :)", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "December 25, 2014", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Shaun Pearson", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBtdvvm7qQM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/124164-the-adventures-of-alain\n"}
