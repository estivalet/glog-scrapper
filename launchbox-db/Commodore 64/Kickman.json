{"altername_name": ["L'\u00c9quilibriste"], "name": "Kickman", "overview": "In this game, you're a clown on an unicycle who has to pop balloons that is falling down from the sky. This can be done by moving left and right to catch them all on the head. Further on, you've to form columns instead of popping them. These columns have a nasty habit by getting each time higher and will give you a lesser time to react. However, if you're close enough to the balloon you can kick the balloon and try again. Another way is to catch the 'Pac-Man' that comes down between the balloons. This will eat the balloons that falls on your head. If you miss you'll fall from your unicycle.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Commodore", "publishers": "Commodore Business Machines", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.94", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C-ab8M6LoQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109131-kickman\n"}
