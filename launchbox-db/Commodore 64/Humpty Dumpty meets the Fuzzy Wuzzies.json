{"altername_name": [], "name": "Humpty Dumpty meets the Fuzzy Wuzzies", "overview": "In this puzzle game, Humpty must make his way to the exit, to do this, you rotate the maze 90 degrees, causing him to fall. The maze must continually be rotated not to navigate to the exit, but also to avoid three types of enemies - bombs, snappers, and of course, the Fuzzy Wuzzies. If he comes into contact with these, he will go splat. Teleports take Humpty to different places, while going through the exit takes Humpty to the next maze. There are 18 mazes in total.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nigel P.
