{"altername_name": [], "name": "Charlie and the Jugs", "overview": "After a nasty incident with a black hole, Charlie Chambers, the NASA astronaut, has been transported back into medieval times. His only way back to the present is to collect diamonds from the jugs at the bottom of the courtyard while archers fire arrows across the castle to stop him. These marksmen can only be killed by a direct hit in their arrow slits. An olde worlde bat flies around the courtyard and while he cannot be killed, a hit is work 300 points. Avoid the bat and arrows, take the diamonds to the top of either castle wall.
