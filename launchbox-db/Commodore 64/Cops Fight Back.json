The game had a slightly different approach where you would shoot upwards from the bottom of the screen in Space Invader style and have to shoot a certain amount of enemies to get to the next part of the \"Ultimate Cops\" collection from Psytronik software. Then, in 2013 \u2013 Psytronik released the Ultimate Cops compilation which had all of the Cops games and a brand new Cops 4 \u2013 The Final Chapter game, replacing this game as the fourth title. However, Cops Fight Back was included as a bonus file in the pack and if you purchase the game from here, you can grab it for yourself!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2013", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Alf Yngve", "publishers": "Psytronik Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/91196-cops-fight-back\n"}
