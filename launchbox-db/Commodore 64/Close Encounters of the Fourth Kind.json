{"altername_name": [], "name": "Close Encounters of the Fourth Kind", "overview": "From the book \"Brainteasers for the Commodore 64\". The aliens have sneaked into our C64s after all - but we believe they are friendly. It is up to you to find out. Hovering above a field, lights rotating around it's outer edge, is a flying saucer. From the saucer comes a sequence of notes which may contain a message of peace. To find you must repeat the notes in the same sequence as the aliens have transmitted them. Every time you repeat the notes properly, the saucer will descend one level towards the ground. Try and bring them in carefully as the last time we succeeded, the space vessel blew up after landing. Use number keys 1 through 8 as your notes starting with middle C. Key in S to indicate the start of a tune. If you can't find the right note key G and Return and a new tune sequence will begin.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Genevi\u00e8ve Ludinski", "publishers": "Phoenix Publishing Associates", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90782-close-encounters-of-the-fourth-kind\n"}
