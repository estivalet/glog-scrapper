If you play against the computer in a Championship knockout competition the computer will randomly select the players out of eight different opponents. Each player has his own characteristics and style of play as their 'favorite doubles' they like to throw. Regardless against whom you play they will become better as you progress towards the final. A practice mode helps you to become familiar and more skillful at throwing the darts.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Binary Design", "publishers": "MAD (Mastertronic Added Dimension)", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.06", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/180_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLrJNIdTdjg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/41679-180\n"}
