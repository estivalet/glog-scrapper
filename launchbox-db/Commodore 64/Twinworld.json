{"altername_name": ["TwinWorld: Land of Vision"], "name": "Twinworld", "overview": "After the Cariken family became complacent, the land of Gaspar ceased to be ruled as well. This left the way clear for evil men such as Maldur the druid to step in and slaughter the family, shattering their magical amulet. Only one of the family survived, and the amulet was broken into 23 pieces. As Ulopa, the sole survivor, you must reclaim the pieces. They are spread across 23 levels of platforming action, combining surface areas with some underground tunnels. You have 3 types of weapons with different functionality: switching between them at the right moments is vital. You can also collect upgrades from the carcasses of dead enemies. Other upgrades such as springs and a parachute can also be found. Twinworld (also spelled TwinWorld or Twin World) is a computer game, published by UBI Soft for the Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, Acorn Archimedes, Amiga and Atari ST computers in the late 1980s.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Blue Byte Software", "publishers": "Ubi Soft Entertainment Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twinworld", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5HxQTvgn3g", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/96912-twinworld\n"}
