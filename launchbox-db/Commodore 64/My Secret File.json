{"altername_name": [], "name": "My Secret File", "overview": "You've read the game, now play the book! Based on the best-selling Puffin book by John Astrop. This is a game, but it is also a personal database for your darkest thoughts. Do you have secrets you wouldn't even confide to your closest friend, let alone your family? Do you have secrets about your friends and family you wouldn't confide to anyone but yourself? At last, you're no longer alone. My Secret File turns your computer into a personal confidante. And to keep your confidences confidential, it's even password protected, because these days, you can't even trust your micro not to blab. Trust no one: file your friends before they file you.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Phil Nathans", "publishers": "Mosaic Publishing", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/122824-my-secret-file\n"}
