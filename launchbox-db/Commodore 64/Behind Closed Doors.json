All you and the BALROG have at your disposal are a copy of the 'Goblin Gazzette', the stub of a pencil and your wits .... will it be enough or will the poor BALROG be destined to spend the rest of his days with nothing but cold porcelain for comfort? It might not be easy but it will sure be fun!!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "May 4, 2019", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gareth Pitchford", "publishers": "Zenobi Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/129383-behind-closed-doors\n"}
