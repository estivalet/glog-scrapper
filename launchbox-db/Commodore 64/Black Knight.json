{"altername_name": [], "name": "Black Knight", "overview": "Black Knight is a game that will not give you a moment's rest. The computer will take you to the beginning of a scene, then control is handed over to your joystick. From then on YOU are the Black Knight, and you've got to make your move before it's too late. Deadly goblins, sword-fights, venomous snakes, horse riding, precipices, mazes, all animated to a standard previously thought impossible - this game has it all. Make no mistake Black Knight is a breakthrough. This is the first time animation of this quality has ever been seen. It takes 16 sprites to move the Black Knight, up till now, 8 sprites have always been thought to be the most you could get on the Commodore 64. This game will be imitated for a long, long time.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kyle Hodgetts", "publishers": "ECP (Entertainment and Computer Products Pty.
