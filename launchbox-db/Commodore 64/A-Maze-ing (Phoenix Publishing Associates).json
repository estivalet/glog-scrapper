{"altername_name": ["Crazy Labyrinth", "A-Maze-Ing"], "name": "A-Maze-ing (Phoenix Publishing Associates)", "overview": "Simple maze game based on the old pen and paper maze escape games. It was developed by Genevi\u00e8ve Ludinski and published as a type-in program in the book, Brainteasers for the Commodore 64. You are at the bottom of a complicated maze, and your objective is to reach the top in the quickest possible time, but also with the the fewest number of possible moves. Don't rush headlong into this one as a little forward planning can save you time and points. Every step counts as a point and every time you try to cross a barrier counts as points. You may exit the maze from any of the exits at the top.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Genevi\u00e8ve Ludinski", "publishers": "Phoenix Publishing Associates", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/88223-a-maze-ing-phoenix-publishing-associates\n"}
