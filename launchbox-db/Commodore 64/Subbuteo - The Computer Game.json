The name is most closely associated with the football game, which for many years was marketed as \"the replica of Association Football\" or Table Soccer. The \"Subbuteo\" name derives from the neo-Latin scientific name Falco subbuteo (a bird of prey commonly known as the Eurasian hobby). This game is dedicated to that hobby and represents it in digital form.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Goliath Games", "publishers": "Electronic Zoo", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4oqK1MA1WY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113357-subbuteo-the-computer-game\n"}
