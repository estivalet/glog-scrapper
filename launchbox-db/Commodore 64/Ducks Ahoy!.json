{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ducks Ahoy!", "overview": "Ducks Ahoy! is a simple arcade game which takes place in Venice. On the screen you see some houses, the canal and the beach (on the top). The player is in control of a boat which can carry two ducks at the same time. The ducks start to walk around the houses slowly getting to the exit where they just jump out into the open no matter if there is a boat waiting for them or it's just water. The aim is to catch the ducks with the boat and deliver them to the beach. To make things more difficult there's a hippo in the water swimming around (always where the bubbles on the surface are). If the hippo catches the boat the player loses a life. After ten ducks are delivered to the beach they start to sing and the the game restarts, increasing the difficulty by making the ducks faster.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Joyce Hakansson Associates, Inc.", "publishers": "CBS Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.68", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JS95qTlmz8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/96754-ducks-ahoy\n"}
