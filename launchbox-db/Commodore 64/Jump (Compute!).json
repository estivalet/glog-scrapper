{"altername_name": [], "name": "Jump (Compute!)", "overview": "A shoot'em up, space invaders style game published in COMPUTE!'s Gazette 1984/11 (Issue #17). Fire your laser and defend your planet from the invading Ryiads. \"jump!\" pits you against an invader who's trying to blast both you and your planet. He's wily and you must use your laser in defense. When you hit the invader, a Ryiad, you get 50 points and 25 energy units. When a Ryiad shot hits the surface of your planet, the point of impact is illustrated by reversing the damaged character. When he hits it a second time, a crater is formed. If he hits the same spot a third time, it disappears and you lose 25 points. You can move over the undamaged and slightly damaged areas of the surface, but you lose a turn if you try to move over craters or pits. Shift-Z or Shift-C to jump left or right over those.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Fernando Ciccarelli", "publishers": "COMPUTE!
