Experience the thrill of being in charge of a great speedway team. At the beginning you have to choose which team to lead and you will be immediately introduced to the particular knockout cup at the best of two matches plus a possible play-off. In this competition you have to face an opposing team over the course of 15 races per match. The meetings will take place alternately at home and away. In each race there are 2 riders per team who will get a score (from 4 to 0 points according to the order of arrival) and in the end the one who has obtained the most points wins. Your task is to select the drivers who will make up the starting grid by deciding on the basis of the results obtained by each member of the team (constantly shown on the screen) and also on the basis of opponents. You must be particularly careful not to over-tire your athletes by always having the same riders race!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Eddie Thewlis", "publishers": "ET Software", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/124393-professional-speedway-manager\n"}
