{"altername_name": [], "name": "Domino (Robtek)", "overview": "Dominoes is an adaptation of the traditional board game where the player competes against one computer opponent. The two players take turns laying domino bricks so that they create a chain of bricks. The bricks are placed so that adjacent numbers match. To win a game the player has to score exactly 72 points. Points are scored when the end dominoes totals a multiple of 3 or 5. So for example if the sum of the bricks is fifteen then the player scores eight points (15/3 + 15/5 = 8). If the sum is not divisible by 3 or 5 then no points will be given. If a player scores higher than 72, the score will be 72 minus the number of points above 72.
