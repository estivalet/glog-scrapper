{"altername_name": [], "name": "Nibbly 2012", "overview": "An updated and expanded version of Nibbly 92, like its predecessor, it is a worm/nibble/snake game, where the player controls a growing snake while eating dots in an enclosed maze. The maze is contained on a single screen, and the snake must eat all the dots without being blocked by its own body, in order to get to the next screen with a new maze. Each level increases the difficulty for the player by increasing the snake growth, until eventually the maze becomes impossible to solve.
