{"altername_name": [], "name": "Soldier One", "overview": "You are a one man army and you have been tasked to sail to an island, take the island before finally taking a fortress containing a mad General who has invaded with his army the island and is now planning more invasions. The game is set over seven stages and you must complete each one to take you nearer to your goal. You have a power bar and on any stage you are shot or bombed you lose part of it and when it is empty it is game over. You also have to be careful with your ammo as it decreases every time you fire. Your power bar and ammo stay the same for all seven stages and you can't get more. The game is set to a clock and your high score is based on your time at the end of a game.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Greve Graphics", "publishers": "American Action", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMV3fvbTLPk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/112542-soldier-one\n"}
