{"altername_name": [], "name": "Duck Shoot (Grenada)", "overview": "Here is a game for your memory, your speed and your eyesight. You will be shown a screen full of fucks -thirty in total - and then you will have to solve a multiplication sum before you can shoot at the sitting ducks. Just in case you are worried about the ducks, they are not real, we borrowed them from a fairground. You will be asked to solve a multiplication table which will be selected randomly and if you get the answer right and type in properly then you will be allowed to shoot at the ducks. It is not as simple as it sounds however, because the gun moves from left to right and back again. You have to stop the gun which will fire on its own at the row of ducks. If you stop the gun in the wrong place the shot may go between a row of the \u2018quackers\u2019 and leave you without a score despite your correct answer to the sum. To fire the gun you must press the space bar. Your score board will show you how many shots were on target.
