{"altername_name": [], "name": "Grand Prix (CCS)", "overview": "From the book \"More BASIC Computer Games\" / a.k.a. \"Grnprx\". In this game you are attempting to complete one lap around a grand prix circuit against one of six opponents, everything from a US Postal delivery truck to a 1974 Ferrari. The track consists of four straightaways and four curves with different maximum speeds possible for each one. Depending on which car you select for your own you can take these curves and straights at different speeds. Also, the car you select will have different braking characteristics which may allow you to had into the curve at higher speeds and then apply the brakes at the last minute. It may sound like it's easy to win by simply selecting a Porsche or Ferrari for your car and racing against a US Mail truck or a well-used Ford Mustang, but beware, it isn't really that easy.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1979", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Creative Computing Software", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/102690-grand-prix-ccs\n"}
