{"altername_name": [], "name": "Telnyr I: The Stone of Telnyr", "overview": "Published in Loadstar #191. An obscure RPG from Australia. Accumulate enough HP, spells, etc... and reach the \"T\" symbol on the second area to win. Telnyr is a hidden island in the southwest Pacific Ocean, where a \"freak combination of magnetic forces has created a virtually impenetrable area,\" keeping ships and planes from approaching it or even seeing it. The mages of the island have an ability to suck in individuals from the real world to help with problems--much like Lord British does in Ultima--and they have recently done so as part of a quest to find the Stone of Telnyr and restore peace to an island overrun by monsters.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Peter R.
