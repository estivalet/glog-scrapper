{"altername_name": [], "name": "Wing Commander", "overview": "Wing Commander is a flight simulator where your mission is to fly around your island home in your jet plane and protect various important locations especially the Nuclear Power plant from enemy fighters attacking the island. There are three levels of skill to choose from Novice, Pilot and Ace before starting the game on the runway. Give the plane some power and with the joystick you pull back to climb into the sky and when high enough raise the undercarriage. The joystick controls the plane while the fire button fires your weapons. Don't give the plane too much power when flying as the plane then shakes before breaking up. Pressing M on the keyboard brings up a map showing the various locations to protect as well as any enemy fighters flying over the island.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "H.G.
