{"altername_name": [], "name": "Alea Jacta", "overview": "The game is a sideways scrolling space shooter with 6 levels in total, written by Julian Crooke whilst at school over the course of a year. The game was never released to anyone, I guess because the C64 was currently dying out or the game just gathered dust as Julian moved on. The game surfaced after in around 2002 it was given to Triad by a friend of Julian\u2019s\u2026 so the game is thankfully out there. This was all that ever existed of the game, and includes music, title screens and an end sequence. It isn\u2019t the best shooter in the world, but it\u2019s certainly one of the better ones out there, and it has some excellent touches such as the water surface.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Julian Crooke", "publishers": "Noetica", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iokckYxKc4M", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86784-alea-jacta\n"}
