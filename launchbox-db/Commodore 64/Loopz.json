{"altername_name": [], "name": "Loopz", "overview": "A puzzle game where the main goal is to make loops! Random pieces are presented over a board, including simple lines and corners as well as S bends and other warped shapes, of varying sizes. It is up to the player to link them up in a loop form, then moving on to the next level. Pieces can be placed on any empty space on the grid, and rotated into one of the four main compass directions. Any pieces which are not part of the finished loop when a level is completed are left on the screen, so there is value in playing towards 2 distinct loops, to ensure that you have options depending on which pieces are drawn - unlike Pipe Dream there are no clues as to which pieces are coming next.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Audiogenic Software", "publishers": "Audiogenic Software", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loopz", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1CPKII1E5A", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/110455-loopz\n"}
