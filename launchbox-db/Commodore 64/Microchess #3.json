{"altername_name": ["Petchess 4000"], "name": "Microchess #3", "overview": "the first version of Microchess was published in 1977 for various CP/M and Z80 machines and was ported to the Commodore PET/CBM a year later. So the first version of PETChess for the C64 was pretty much ready to run even before the machine debuted. This updated game is a graphically improved, and faster version of that first port and it does a pretty good job, without too many slowdown, especially when run from floppy.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Norgayer Software", "publishers": "Norgayer Software", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/122337-microchess-3\n"}
