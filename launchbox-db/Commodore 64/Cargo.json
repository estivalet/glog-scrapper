{"altername_name": ["Quadral", "Technopuzzle"], "name": "Cargo", "overview": "Cargo was a game which was being developed by Simon Nicol and Stavros Fasoulas under the Ducksoft Development label, and was meant for Silverbird Software. It apparently was to prove a point according to Said, that a budget title could be written overnight. It had Simon\u2019s star field in the background, and an Amidar style maze on the top. There was to be a Vorpal loader and a cast off Hubbard track, but nothing seems to exist of this. They may not have quite managed to get the tune included \u2013 unless a budding hacker can find it tucked away? Richard Hewison of The Bird Sanctuary (a tribute site to Firebird and the other Telecomsoft labels) couldn\u2019t recall the title, but suggested that at the time it would have likely gone on the Silverbird label. You can see elements of Quedex and Delta within the game, but also Simon\u2019s distinctive star field. It\u2019s a neat puzzler where you colour in the maps in Painter style", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Simon Nicol", "publishers": "Editions Fermont", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.edicola8bit.com/riviste/formula_64/c64/preview/technopuzzle.webm", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90327-cargo\n"}
