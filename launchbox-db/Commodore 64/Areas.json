{"altername_name": [], "name": "Areas", "overview": "A geometrical educational game for 1 or 2 players in which you have to solve the total area of various shapes. Developed by Vince Apps and published as a type-in by Granada Publishing Ltd. in his book 40 Educations Games for the Commodore 64. This game is a bit of a brain teaser and might drive you mad before you start to get it right. To begin with you might even need a pencil and some paper but really that is a bit of a cheat. The object is to work out the total area of a rectangle and a triangle - together. Your parents will be highly impressed when you can tell them how much carpet they need for that funny shaped room upstairs. You will be asked \u2018One or two players?\u2019 Type in 1 or 2 and press RETURN. You will then be asked for the player\u2019s, or players\u2019, names. RETURN as before. The computer will then show you a green rectangle with a red triangle on top. You will be given the length of three of the sides and asked to work out the total area. If you do not get the answer correct first time the computer will then ask you to give the area of the rectangle first. If you answer this part correctly you will then be shown the triangle again and asked for its area. If either part of your answer is wrong the computer will give you the correct total area sum. If you get the answer right first time, clever clogs, you will be given two points but if you answer in two halves you will get only one point for your correct answers. To help you bend the rules the formula for area is CxB + 1/2 Bx(A-C).", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Vince Apps", "publishers": "Granada Publishing", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/116910-areas\n"}
