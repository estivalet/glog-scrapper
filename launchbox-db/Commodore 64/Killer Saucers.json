{"altername_name": [], "name": "Killer Saucers", "overview": "Your city is under attack by incoming killer saucers. Your mission is to defend your city from the aliens. The aliens will appear from both sides of the game area. They will also attempt to fire missiles and dive-bomb and destroy your armed vehicle. In order to complete each wave. You have to shoot 50 aliens. Be warned though, you have a limited amount of ammo at your disposal. Lives are lost if you are hit by a killer saucer, or its bullets or you run out of missiles yourself. There are 8 levels to play, and you will get no extra lives. Try to rake in as many points as you possibly can. Good luck. Written partly on theC64 emulation box as part of the CF Power Pack Challenge.
