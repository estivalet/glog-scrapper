All the top brass are convinced that nothing is wrong; the only exception is Dr. Norton, a very absent-minded person, who has been sacked for voicing his opinions about MASTA (the NORAD computer). He has talked to MASTA and has the code which on insertion into MASTA will stop the War: unfortunately, he has forgotten this code but he can remember that a ditty he made up is very important in that it gives clues to enable a person to stop MASTA.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Daryll Reynolds", "publishers": "Computer Classics Pty.
