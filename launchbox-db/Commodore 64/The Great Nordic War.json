The initial leaders of the anti-Swedish alliance were Peter I of Russia, Frederick IV of Denmark\u2013Norway and Augustus II the Strong of Saxony\u2013Poland\u2013Lithuania. Frederick IV and Augustus II were defeated by Sweden, under Charles XII, and forced out of the alliance in 1700 and 1706 respectively, but rejoined it in 1709 after the defeat of Charles XII at the Battle of Poltava. George I of Great Britain and the Electorate of Hanover joined the coalition in 1714 for Hanover and in 1717 for Britain, and Frederick William I of Brandenburg-Prussia joined it in 1715.
