Blackjack, or the game of 21, is played against the computer, it being the dealer. Cards are dealt from a self-replenishing desk. Standard rules are as follows: \u2022 Blackjack wins unless the dealer also gets blackjack, in which case there is no winning player. \u2022 The highest score below 21 wins. \u2022 The dealer must draw a card if he is below 17, but must stand if he has 17 or greater. \u2022 Aces count as 11 unless it would force a hand over 21, in which case the ace counts as 1.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1978", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ken Tracton", "publishers": "Tab Books, Inc.", "genres": "Casino", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/108292-blackjack-tab-books\n"}
