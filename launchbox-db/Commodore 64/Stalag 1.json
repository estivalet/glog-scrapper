{"altername_name": ["Stalag I"], "name": "Stalag 1", "overview": "In Stalag 1, you play as commander of a WW2 prison camp, or Stammlager. Your task is to stop the prisoners from tunneling out of the camp, as depicted in films such as The Great Escape. Use the joystick to move around the camp grounds, with the barracks in the centre of the screen. The POWs will be seen as small men of 8x8 pixels digging coloured lines in the ground, and you stop them by stomping on them, upon which the first tones of Deutschland \u00fcber alles is played. If a prisoner reaches the camp fence, the tunnel is open and many prisoners will make a quick escape. Moving the officer to the end of the tunnel will remove it, though. Pressing the joystick button while moving will make your officer run. While the camp has watch dogs, they are of no use to you, running around aimlessly and stunning you so that the prisoners can dig without worrying about you. Once six prisoners have escaped, it's game over.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kevin A.
