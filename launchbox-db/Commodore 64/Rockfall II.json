{"altername_name": ["Crokko"], "name": "Rockfall II", "overview": "A Boulderdash clone game and second in a series by Reflectice Designs, it was published in Italy as Crokko in both Super C64 e C128 n.40 (dicembre 1989) and in Supplementi Edigamma/pubblirome - 100 games 90 (1990). The precious stones of Rockfall, which are indispensable for the production of energy, are starting to be scarce. It was therefore decided to send you to the mines again on the asteroids orbiting the Earth's Sun to recover some of these precious stones. The main difficulty consists in the presence of hostile alien beings, called Crokko, who can take a life from you if they touch you; furthermore, the stones are set in precarious positions and there is a constant risk that something will collapse when you try to extract them. You must recover a number of stones for each cave you visit (indicated at the bottom of the screen). After you reach the number you have to go back to the front door and enter it to go to the next more difficult cave. If you manage to make boulders fall on the aliens the turn into the precious stones you seek.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Duncan Scott Kershaw", "publishers": "Pubblirome", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/4ITV-tgseJE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/126252-rockfall-ii\n"}
