{"altername_name": ["Bounty"], "name": "Gun City", "overview": "A western style cross-hairs shooter. Take out the bad guys but leave the little girl with the physics books. This game takes place in the dusty Far West, where you play the roll of a famous bounty killer who dedicates his life to hunting the most dangerous criminals, such as the terrible band of Billy Destroyer, who have taken over Gun City and the surrounding countryside. Your task is to free this country from the presence of criminals and to restore peace and serenity among the honest citizens. Use your aim to hit as many bandits as possible that appear at the windows and doors. You have a time limit in which you must hit a certain number of opponents and if you succeed you can move on to the next level. So get'em in the cross hairs quick!
