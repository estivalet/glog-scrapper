{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tit Bit", "overview": "Published in Golden Disk 64 1991/01. Tit Bit is a single-screen platformer that is about opening a door so you can go to the next level. To achieve this, some items have to be collected. The enemies floating around make this plan difficult. The level backgrounds and the successful music repeat themselves after a few levels, but the enemies are getting faster and faster. Tit Bit 2 can only be played alone, unfortunately a two-player mode is not provided.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "January 1, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jim Nowak", "publishers": "CP Verlag", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvMR8doOWVk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/132972-tit-bit\n"}
