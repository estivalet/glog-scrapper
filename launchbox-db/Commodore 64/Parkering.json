{"altername_name": ["Parking Game", "The Parking Game"], "name": "Parkering", "overview": "Parkering (also known as The Parking Game) is a 1987 C64 game developed by Simon Fox and published under the label \"Silent Soft\" This game was the only C64 game that both Fox and Silent Soft released, which may have been just a personal label used by Fox. The objective of this game is to park your car in-between other cars without 1. passing the cars 2. crashing into the cars or the side of the road. The game sounds simple enough, but it's not as easy as it looks. Getting the game started is slightly tricky, however. First off when you run the game, and the crackscreen comes up, you have to press the fireb utton on the port 2 joystick, then once the crackscreen ends, and the official title screen appears, you then have to switch to port 1, as the game plays using port 1 and not port 2. Then in order to start the game, you MUST read the instructions, as simply pressing the fire button does not actually work. Then once you read the instructions, you then have to press F7 to start the game. Released in Italy in the Alga Soft n.19a compilation.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Simon Fox", "publishers": "Napoli Alga Soft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.edicola8bit.com/riviste/formula_64/c64/preview/test_patente.webm", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151452-parkering\n"}
