{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bug Crusher", "overview": "You start the game with 5 lives. The object of gameplay is to destroy bugs by running into them with your ship. After you emerge from one of the blue protected areas you will be engaged by the red saucers. You can hold the fire button to become temporarily invincible and gain the ability to pass through objects and enemies. Be careful as this consumes fuel. While you are behind a blue barrier or between the rows of yellow saucers you will be safe.
