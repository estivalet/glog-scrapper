In this game you race a motorcycle around the world, completing each section of track within a time limit.

Each continent is a different difficulty level: Africa is beginner, Asia is junior, the Americas are senior, and Europe is expert.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Software Studios", "publishers": "Electric Dreams Software", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.43", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Hang-On", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ahzcDic0s", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6366-super-hang-on\n"}
