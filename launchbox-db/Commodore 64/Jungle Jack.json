In this game, the goal of each level (seven levels in total) is to make it to the US base my going around in a jungle maze while shooting enemy soldiers and avoiding bombs from helicopters. The game gets harder as the levels progress with the enemy soldiers and helicopters increasing in speed for each level. If you manage to complete all seven levels, the game just loops the seventh level over and over again until you run out of lives (providing you're not using trainers that is).
