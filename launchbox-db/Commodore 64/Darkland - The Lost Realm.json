{"altername_name": ["Dark Space"], "name": "Darkland: The Lost Realm", "overview": "A collect-em-up style action game that appears to have been created in Italy. Experience a strange world where movements can be measured in leaps and bounds and where the hero moves and defends himself from attacks, throwing a very elastic ball that has the power to take down opponents. The attack is triggered by the appearance of a continuous series of armed devils coming down from the sky, which seems like the wrong direction. You start with 9 lives but you'll be needing all of them as this is a very high level of difficulty. Every life lost can turn off the lights, so I hope you remember your way around. Each area you open gets you a step closer to the final victory. Published under several names by multiple Italian publishers, including Videoteca Computer n.13 where it was named Dark Space.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gordon", "publishers": "Edizione Logica 2000", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaCAFudM_gk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/95904-darkland-the-lost-realm\n"}
