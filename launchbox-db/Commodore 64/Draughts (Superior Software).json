{"altername_name": [], "name": "Draughts (Superior Software)", "overview": "A simple game, but with lots of nice features including four different modes of play. No restrictions: Any legal move can be made, so you do not need to take a piece if you do not want to. Must take: If you can take a piece, you mu do so, but if there are more than one options to take a piece you can pick which one. Must take all: If you take a piece and it is possible to take another piece immediately, then you must take this additional piece. However, if there is another move which only involves taking one piece, you are free to choose to do this move instead. Must take most: Like the one above, but you must choose the route that takes the most pieces possible.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "David Thompson", "publishers": "Superior Software", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/97646-draughts-superior-software\n"}
