{"altername_name": [], "name": "Forced Encounter", "overview": "Forced Encounter is a fixed-screen shooter in which you have to destroy a UFO. It's not as simple as it looks, as the UFO is protected by several layers of force fields. The goal is to chip away at the Force Field (similar to games like Star Castle and the Atari 2600 classic, Yars' Revenge) until you can get a clear shot at the ship.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bob Carr", "publishers": "Magic Carpet Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWee3b9lydE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/101490-forced-encounter\n"}
