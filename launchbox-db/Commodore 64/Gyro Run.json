{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gyro Run", "overview": "An original fun hi score party game written for the CSDB Fun Compo 2021. Do you remember the classic seaside, fairground arcade machines where you insert a coin into the slot, and control a remote-controlled water boat, bumper car or something like that around the track? The New Dimension has gone one step further is very proud to present a pretty original hi score attack party game called Gyro Run. A silly game in which you control a moving spinner around the arena attempting to score as many points as you can. The goal of the game is to grab as many tasty treats that spawn into the arena at random. Also objects can also spawn into a different object. These objects will give points (200, 300 or 500). The treats will also award the spinner a temporary shield which is short lived. If the spinner crashes into the deadly skulls without a shield (or the shield just run out) a life is lost. It is also possible that treats or skulls will spawn on exactly the same spot as your spinner. It is best to keep the shield up and running. After approximately 45 seconds, a smart bomb will appear. Pick one of these to clear the arena. Controlling of the spinner is completely different. There is a dial at the bottom of the screen, which can be turned to 8 directions, clockwise or anti-clockwise. The spinner can only change direction via the fire button control. The game took first place in the game's portion of the competition", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "May 28, 2021", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Richard Bayliss", "publishers": "itch.io", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L_97H1KfDw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/160366-gyro-run\n"}
