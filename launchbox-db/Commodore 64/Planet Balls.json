Planet Balls was inhabited by peaceful balls that lived under the guidance of their King. But one bad day the evil Dark Cube made them all prisoners! Save King Ball and his subjects and restore peace on the planet! Planet Balls is reminiscent of Lemmings but in a more light way. Your ball buddies have a start point and the goal is to reach the end point without losing any. You can build blocks over each other to make the Balls reach there destination. You get some obstacles, blocks that cannot build, blocks that remove... so it got more and more difficult at each level.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "August 29, 2020", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "AGPX", "publishers": "", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HK_o0zu3_Q", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/139898-planet-balls\n"}
