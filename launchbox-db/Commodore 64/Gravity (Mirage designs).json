{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gravity (Mirage designs)", "overview": "Richard Bayliss' first ever Lunar Lander style game. Still buggy, but sort of playable, despite those little issues. The object of this game is to land your saucer on to the landing pad , but watch out for the deadly alien spheres. Collide into one of those and your space ship will become toast. If you land enough times on to the pad, then you will move on to the very next level. Best of luck commander!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2000", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Richard Bayliss", "publishers": "The New Dimension (TND)", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/102803-gravity-mirage-designs\n"}
