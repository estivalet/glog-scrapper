{"altername_name": ["Hideous Bill & the Gi-Gants"], "name": "Hideous Bill and the Gi-Gants", "overview": "Bill must save his girlfriend Greta from the gi-gants, giant ants who plan to turn her into ant food. The game is divided into three levels, with the objective being in each level to crush all the ant eggs in order to proceed to the next level. Three gi-gants roam around each level trying to destroy Bill. Warp tunnels are located on the left and right sides of each level, and these can be used to get to either side quickly. Besides crushing eggs, objects scattered around the level that can be put to good use. In level one, Bill can collect spears which he can use to slay a gi-gant, but Whatever gi-giant gets destroyed will be replaced by an egg in the center of the maze, and this egg will hatch to reveal another gi-gant. In level two, there are no weapons but a passage in the center, whose doors can be activated by placing two levers into holes near the passage. The passage can be used to trap gi-gants, making Bill's task easier. Inside the passage is a can of beans that are used to break down walls in level three, and it is this level where Bill can finally rescue his true love.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Steve Lee", "publishers": "Virgin Games", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET_M4jVlXww", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/104493-hideous-bill-and-the-gi-gants\n"}
