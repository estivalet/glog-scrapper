{"altername_name": [], "name": "High Seas", "overview": "A marine exploration simulation. From the days of fighting sail comes this game of combat on the high seas. Although produced very early in the PC era (1988), Ralph Bosson's High Seas works from a graphical deck view, resorting to a chart view only for position checks (which can become important in fleet engagements). It operates either on 10-game-minute turns, or interrupt-to-issue-orders mode. It models the effects of wind on maneuvering and the effects of different ammo types against the wooden walls and sails of opposing vessels. A very advanced feature included is a scenario designer. The game can be played either hot-seated or with a computer opponent.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mike Lepage", "publishers": "Gard\u00e9 Games", "genres": "Vehicle Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/104505-high-seas\n"}
