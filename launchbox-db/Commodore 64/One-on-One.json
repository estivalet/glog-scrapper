{"altername_name": [], "name": "One-on-One", "overview": "Control either Julius Erving or Larry Bird in front of a single basket, in a game of one on one. The user can select to play either to a certain score or for a certain amount of time. When on offense, the player can rotate to keep away from his rival, take a shot from a distance or move in to the basket for special up-close slam-dunks. When on defense, you can try to take your rival's ball or jump up to block a shot. Particularly good set-ups get a slow-motion replay. You can even smash the glass on the backboard, which will send an irate janitor onto the court to clean up the mess.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Eric Hammond", "publishers": "Electronic Arts, Inc.", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.55", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_vs._Bird:_One_on_One", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lN90JMQRNI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90545-one-on-one\n"}
