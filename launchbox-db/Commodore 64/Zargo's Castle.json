{"altername_name": [], "name": "Zargo's Castle", "overview": "Zargo's Castle is a public domain text adventure for the Commodore 64. It as developed and released by Harold Dixon in 1994. Description: Welcome to the crazy world of Zargo's Wundaland - a place of magic and awe. You will have many puzzles to solve, many traps to avoid, a few monsters to overcome, and certainly tons of treasure to collect! Baron Zargo is an eccentric old man with many strange ideas, but his latest one does make some sense. He wishes to retire and wants to leave the castle to his country. He has however, being a rather clumsy character, lost his crown jewels. The Baron had knocked his coronet off the bedside cabinet one morning when rising. The jewels popped out and flew all over. Before he could retrieve them, several shifty imps grabbed them and made a quick getaway. The Baron called his guards, but they were too late, the jewels were never recovered, though the imps aren't really interested in them, they will just have hidden them somewhere in the castle. The Baron has offered to vacate the castle, taking all his slaves, and signing over everything to anyone who can find the crown jewels. He says the castle holds many treasures, which the searcher may keep. All you have to do is return to him his jewels. The adventure is split into five parts.
