{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dictator", "overview": "You are the dictator of the fictional republic of Ritimba. Your task is to keep everybody happy - the army, the peasants, the land owners.... while secretly filling your personal bank account as much as possible. You've got the secret police on your side... and the guerrillas on the other one. Every month, one of those groups makes a request. You can accept it (which might involve quite a bit of money) or deny it, making groups either happy or not. You can also choose to borrow money from the Russians or the Americans. As the old saying goes.. it's impossible to make everybody happy. So sooner or later, you'll be facing a revolution or assassination attempt. Did you purchase that helicopter or are you going to face the music?", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "dk'tronics", "publishers": "dk'tronics", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/95613-dictator\n"}
