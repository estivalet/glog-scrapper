Essentially, you are a P.I. who specializes in the world of the occult. The story starts with you in your office where you have to piece together the information found in the envelope on your desk. The main puzzles in Part I are broken down into finding out where to go, an interesting concept, but a sometimes tedious one.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Anthony Collins", "publishers": "The Guild Adventure Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ6R7_kf7WI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/123067-nythyhel\n"}
