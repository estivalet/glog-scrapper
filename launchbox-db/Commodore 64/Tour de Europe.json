Run across the screen, avoiding all the items (like teapots, wrenches, pots, scissors, spiders, glasses and even a thermos!) falling from the sky and pick up the bags and return them to your side of the screen to gain points. When you get enough bags across you proceed to a new country and background. Make your way across the continent on your tour de Europe.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "LVC", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kQvytBAmC8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/167210-tour-de-europe\n"}
