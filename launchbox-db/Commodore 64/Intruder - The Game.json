{"altername_name": [], "name": "Intruder: The Game", "overview": "A Uridium style shooter published in Compute mit 1988/08. Intruder is a new version of the game URIDIUM. You fly with a glider over a graphically very well represented platform and have to try to fly to and collect energy points. These points can only be collected by flying over them exactly. The glider to be controlled encounters a wide variety of enemy aircraft on its journey. These come from opposite directions and the player must try to dodge and avoid a devastating collision. The player can change direction, turn around and go in the same direction as the enemy airplanes fly. But this is only useful to avoid collisions where you can only adjust the flight path so it points in the other direction, energy points have to be collected and a runway has to be reached. But evasive maneuvers alone are not always enough to avert a dangerous collision. Sometimes whole squadrons of planes arrive at the same time, and the only chance to break through is to shoot the way clear. Be careful, not all enemy missiles can be shot down! It is important to dodge the enemy flying mines early on, as they cannot be destroyed with the laser beam. Another pitfall of this game is that most of the energy points to be collected can be found directly in front of imposing skyscrapers that cannot be flown over. Since all energy points must be collected before you can land safely and advance to the next level.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ronald Mayer", "publishers": "Tronic Verlag GmbH", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/98165-intruder-the-game\n"}
