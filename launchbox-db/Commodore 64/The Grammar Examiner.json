{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Grammar Examiner", "overview": "The Grammar Examiner is a grammar board game for one to four players. Players take on the role of an aspiring newspaper reporter, where they must travel about a board trying to earn money by answering grammar questions. There is the option for a computer opponent named Melvin, who has modifiable intelligence. Players can role a 1 - 6, and can move about on the board as they see fit. They can't land on the same type of space twice in a row. Squares include random transportation about the map, being sent back to the starting area, random chance where the player gains or loses money, a grammar multiple choice question, or having to fix all the grammar errors in a short paragraph. The player can gain or lose money on every square, and the goal is to reach $23,000 before their opponents do.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Designware", "publishers": "Britannica Software", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75879-the-grammar-examiner\n"}
