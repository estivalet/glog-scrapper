{"altername_name": [], "name": "Krazy Kong 64", "overview": "Krazy Kong 64 is a single screen platformer loosely based on the arcade game Donkey Kong where you have to rescue Maidens at the top of the screen held by a giant ape. Starting at the bottom of the screen you must run up the platforms diagonally in the form of steps, with three levels of platforms to navigate. As you run up the screen you must avoid barrels that are thrown by the ape by jumping over them. If you hit a barrel then it is game over and if you reach the Maidens then you can rescue one before attempting to get the next one on a new screen.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "The Computer Room", "publishers": "Bubble Bus Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109277-krazy-kong-64\n"}
