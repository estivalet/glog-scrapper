{"altername_name": [], "name": "Confusion", "overview": "Confusion from Chris McDermott was published in Loadstar #109 in 1993. It is described as Peg Jumping with a twist. The game features a demo routing that shows you how to play and a hint feature that allows you to step through the solutions to the puzzles. There's even a mode for creating your own puzzles for your friends to play. In this version the twist is, when you jump a peg it is not removed, but rather changes color. If a peg jumps over a peg with a higher color then the jumping peg increases its color by one. If a peg jumps over a lower color the jumping peg decreases its color by one. Jumping over a peg of the same color makes no change. The hierarchy of colors: \u2022 5 Red \u2022 4 Blue \u2022 3 Green \u2022 2 Purple \u2022 1 Yellow The objective is to jump the pegs on a work board so that it matches the pegs on the given goal board on the right.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Chris McDermott", "publishers": "Softdisk Publishing, Inc.", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/91166-confusion\n"}
