{"altername_name": ["Go-Carts"], "name": "Go Carts", "overview": "A game published in the ReRun Special Summer Edition 1990. SMELL THE BURNING RUBBER as your go-cart careens around the perilous curves! Go-Carts, an arcade-style racing game, pits you against a number of computerized drivers. The object is to earn points by passing the other go-carts on the curvy road. A joystick plugged into port 2 is used to accelerate, decelerate and steer. You must time each pass perfectly and accurately adjust your speed to the radius and slope of each curve; on the really sharp ones, you should slow down to around 30 to avoid sliding into traffic. When the road curves to the right, pass in the right lane; when the road curves to the left, pass in the left lane. Every cart passed is worth five points. You start the race with five go-carts, which race one at a time. Whenever your cart collides with another or runs out of time, it disappears. However, you won't lose a cart that has passed at least 29 others in a single race. A race lasts 60 seconds. You can pause the action by pressing the space bar and restart it by pressing the Fl key. As you race, the track moves down in front of you in 3-D fashion and mountains scroll in the background. In spite of all this action, the screen update is as rapid as the monitor raster rate itself.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Charles Orcutt", "publishers": "RUN", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/367638-go-carts\n"}
