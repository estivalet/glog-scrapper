{"altername_name": ["Cataball", "Hoppin' Mad", "Hoppin'Mad"], "name": "Hopping Mad", "overview": "The player controls four bouncing balls that must make their way through twelve environments ranging from park to desert and beach to undersea world, collecting up to ten balloons in each. Each one of the balls must deal with several hazards, by jumping over them or crushing them. Collision with any of these will cause a ball to burst. The player can speed up or slow down the balls, or control their height, to make it easy to avoid these hazards. If all four balls have been punctured, the player loses a life. Once all ten balloons have been collected, the player is transported to the next environment, and when they have managed to get through all twelve environments, the player is transported back to the first environment. The game was re-released as Cataball as part of the Hit-Pak \"Trio\" compilation.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Elite Systems", "publishers": "Eccore", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.38", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQVZVtHeVP4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/96666-hopping-mad\n"}
