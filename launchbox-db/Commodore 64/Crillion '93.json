{"altername_name": ["Crillion 93"], "name": "Crillion '93", "overview": "Except for the new level design, there are no further differences to the original game Crillion. With the help of the joystick a ball is controlled, that can be recolored over color blocks and as in Breakout resolve stones of the same color. Furthermore there are push-able stones that pose unwanted obstacles and skull fields that cost a life. Already the first levels have a relatively high difficulty level and without strategy probably no level can be solved.
