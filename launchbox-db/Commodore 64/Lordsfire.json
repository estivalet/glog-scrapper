{"altername_name": [], "name": "Lordsfire", "overview": "In the game, you were to control a young Lord of the castle-in-the-sky, where you have inherited a mighty winged steed and a powerful fire-staff, but more importantly the hand of a beautiful princess in marriage. Furious at being overlooked on the wedding guest list, a coven of witches steal and lock her away in a distant tower and cast your staff deep into a volcano. Heartbroken, you head eastward on a quest to save her. The game would take place across 6 distinct locations overall, including: The Wood, The Volcano, The Battle, The Cerulean Caves, The Well and The Coven. It was a neat and ambitious first development by Jeremy, all crammed into a single load and developed over a 2-3 month period.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "", "developers": "Jeremy Walker", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://www.gamesthatwerent.com/gtw64/lordsfire/", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwQEEmdtaSw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/169425-lordsfire\n"}
