{"altername_name": ["Labyrinth"], "name": "Laberinto", "overview": "The game introduces us to our character, who, invited by a friend of your father, challenges us to enter his own labyrinth in order to overcome his own test and escape from it alive. To do this, we place ourselves in a position on the map, already inside the labyrinth, from which we will only see the adjoining rooms (we recommend that you make a map) and we will advance. Along the way you will come across different aids or tests and you will have to overcome them, one by one, until you exit the maze.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2013", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jesus Zafra Diaz", "publishers": "www.commodoreplus.org", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://www.commodoreplus.org/2014/11/laberinto.html", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/142636-laberinto\n"}
