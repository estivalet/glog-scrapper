A program for youngsters must be simple and yet exciting to them, maintaining their interest and stimulating them to explore new concepts and master old ones. SCHOOL TECH WORD SEARCH is just such a program. It presents the user with a variety of grammatical structures and problems, and gives them an opportunity to learn, by trial and error, the basic precepts of vocabulary, while furthering an awareness and ease with the computer. School Tech Word Search-a responsible educational system developed as an aid to in-class teaching, and at-home learning. The child is shown a sentence with a word missing. Five choices are shown. Four are incorrect for spelling, grammar or context reasons. The child types in his/her choice. The next display shows if the answer was right. If wrong, the right answer is shown. The child can quit at any point in the quiz. A scoreboard is then displayed, showing: words attempted, words right, words wrong, and the percentage right. The child is given the choice of repeating the quiz, or quitting.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "David Winogrond", "publishers": "ALA Software", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/361282-school-tech-word-search\n"}
