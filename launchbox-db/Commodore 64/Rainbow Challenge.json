{"altername_name": [], "name": "Rainbow Challenge", "overview": "A brain puzzle game created by Lee Novak and published in Loadstar #147. Recreate the pattern in the 10x10 grid in as few moves as possible. Time is not a factor but you are limited to making a maximum of 9,999 moves. The target is not shown, but there are markers around the grid telling you what goes where. Colors are across the top, and shapes are down the left side. You must put each shape of each color in exactly the right place. There is an undo feature that acts like a mulligan in golf and takes back your moves if you decide to revert.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Lee Novak", "publishers": "J & F Publishing, Inc.", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKSScm183s0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/166467-rainbow-challenge\n"}
