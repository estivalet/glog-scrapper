The events are Running, Archery, Cycling, Football, Swimming, Squat Thrusts, Canoeing and Arm Dips. There is no qualification time/score to beat and you compete in all events regardless of performance. The game plays in a number of levels and should you score more points than Brian you win the level and move onto the next one where the process is repeated. Afterwards the scores from each level are combined for a total score, should Brian score more points than you at the end of any level then you will lose the challenge.
