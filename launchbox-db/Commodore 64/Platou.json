{"altername_name": [], "name": "Platou", "overview": "A puzzle game for one or two players. When you bounce off of the squares on the board, many of them will disintegrate, so be sure to plan your route to all the squares of your color. When you have hit the objective number for your level, you move on to a new one. You have 3 lives and will lose them by jumping to an empty space. The game came with a built in Editor so you could create your own challenges and play them with your friends.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Michael Herwig", "publishers": "Kingsoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/NeBVHj1CCkk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/124127-platou\n"}
