{"altername_name": [], "name": "Alien Attack (Interface Publications)", "overview": "Game created by Tim Hartness & Brett Hale and published in 1984 in The Big Fat Book of Commodore 64 Games. Earth has fallen on hard times. The entire responsibility for defending the poor old planet against teeming hordes of less-than-friendly alien creatures has fallen on your shoulders....again. Earth is the nine E's up in the top right hand corner and the aliens are represented by the A's. The aliens Start the game up against the left hand side of the solar system. As well as aliens and the earth, this sector of space contains the hapless human defender (you, shown here as an H), three 'droids shown as D's who are working for the aliens, and a number of generally nasty space-mines (shown as M's) which will hurt anybody or anything\u2019 they come into contact with. Needless to say, the aim of the game is to prevent the aliens from Landing on earth. You can only do this by blowing them up, which you do simply by Landing on top of them. Note that a floating mine will do you a rather fatal amount of harm if you happen to connect with it.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tim Hartnell & Brett Hale", "publishers": "Interface Publications", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.58", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86850-alien-attack-interface-publications\n"}
