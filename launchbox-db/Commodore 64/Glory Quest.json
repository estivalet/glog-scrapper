{"altername_name": [], "name": "Glory Quest", "overview": "Glory Quest is a 1-2 player simultaneous game which combines a maze shooter with a collect 'em up style game. This is NOT a co-op game, as you're basically competing against the second player in 2 player mode, not teaming up with the other player. Collect money, food, and health potions and shoot the skull shaped monsters. There are also teleports that teleport you around various areas of the maze, and a vortex which takes you to the next level.
