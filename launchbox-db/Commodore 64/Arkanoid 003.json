{"altername_name": [], "name": "Arkanoid 003", "overview": "Arkanoid is one of the most well-known Breakout variants, which can demand everything even from good players. The levels consist of many rectangular blocks, that need to be destroyed by an energy ball. The Vaus capsule forms a barrier with which you hurl the ball onto the blocks. If you lose a ball, also the Vaus capsule will lose one of its 5 lives. Behind some blocks hides one of seven different extras. If the block is destroyed, an extra capsule sinks to the ground. If you catch it with the Vaus capsule, you will receive - next to points - an additional fitting, such as a wider bat or a laser. This is a fan made clone using one of the level makers that came with some versions of the game. This version is NOT to be confused with Arkanoid III by CFL.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "The Freak", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/124318-arkanoid-003\n"}
