{"altername_name": [], "name": "The LARC-1 Mission", "overview": "As a pilot, you've heard of all the dangers of reconnaisance missions: radar defense systems, land-based barriers, and worst of all, missiles. Although regular missiles are troubIe enough for reconnaisance pilots, heat-seeking missiles are their greatest problem. All this talk never meant anything to you until you were picked to lead a reconnaisance mission through enemy territory. The code name for the mission is LARC-1. You'll be flying the government's experimental L.A.R.C. prototype (for Low Altitude Reconnaisance Craft). The terrain you'll be flying over is covered with radar placements, pylons, and walls. Walls have large holes which your craft can pass through. There are also heat-seeking missiles that home in on the heat from your ship's exhaust. The only way to stop a heat-seeker is to cause it to collide with an obstacle.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Joseph Bedard", "publishers": "Ion International, Inc.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/368768-the-larc-1-mission\n"}
