{"altername_name": [], "name": "Crazy Sue", "overview": "Crazy Susi is actually not that crazy, she just tries to keep her life safe. She got lost in a dark, magical forest and is now desperately looking for an exit. Unfortunately, the cunning and mean inhabitants of the dense wooded area thwart her plans. Since Susi has no weapons to defend herself against the nasty figures, she has to withdraw without further ado and jump over them. The numerous monsters see through this quickly and for this reason attack in various formations that are very difficult to penetrate. The joystick in port # 2 is used to play. Joystick left / right lets Susi run in the appropriate direction and a well-dosed upward pressure lets her jump into the air. The height can be set individually by pressing the top for a short or long time. Evaluate in the upper line of the screen the current score, the remaining time and number of lives displayed.
