{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ultimate Wizard", "overview": "This updated version of Wizard is a platform-style game which was likened to Epyx's Jumpman. Your character is the Ultimate Wizard. You must face dark enemies as you move through the bricks, ladders, staircases of the game. Cast spells to destroy them, or otherwise avoid them using levitation arrows or other magic. When you Wizard finds the key and places it in the keyhole, he is finished for that level, but soon the next level will appear while sounds play as the level materializes in front of the player.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Progressive Peripherals & Software", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "6", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizard_(1984_video_game)#Ultimate_Wizard", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/dxDvRyOGyFk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72088-ultimate-wizard\n"}
