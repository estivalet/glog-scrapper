Time to manage them and make them men, winning promotion from division 3 to division 1. After choosing your country you are taken to a list of options. Here you can pick your team, train them and check any injured players. The actual match is shown in a TV studio with a presenter. Here you see a clock counting the minutes gone in the game. When there is a decisive moment the game switches to a overhead view of the pitch. Here you can see an attempt at a try or a kick at goal. Sometimes a try is scored or the player is tackled. If a try is scored then you watch the conversion attempt.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ian Copeland", "publishers": "Zeppelin Games", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/124104-world-rugby\n"}
