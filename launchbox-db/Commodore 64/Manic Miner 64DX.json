{"altername_name": [], "name": "Manic Miner 64DX", "overview": "A superb remake of the Matthew Smith classic developed and coded by Graham \"Toki\" Axten (The Bear Essentials, Bonkey Kong, Dustin', etc.) and released December 29, 2019. Unlike the original C64 version, this version plays more like the original version that Matthew Smith developed himself on the ZX Spectrum. However, you have a choice to play either the original C64 version, or the 2019 remake in the game's startup screen. The game also has a built-in \"trainer\" in it's options menu. Description: You play the role of Miner Willy, a bold explorer and adventurer. He discovers a network of underground caverns used by an advanced but now extinct civilization, and realizes that the mines contain lucrative metal ores. Through 20 caverns, you must collect all treasures before all time (air) runs out, watching out for the nasty guardians, the obstacles, dead falls, quicksands and all elements to be found in a classic platform game.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "December 29, 2019", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Graham Axten", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl0e4ZyOook&t=12s", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/123958-manic-miner-64dx\n"}
