So yes very much like boulder dash, but featuring lots of cool new levels, a lovely loading screen, a great soundtrack, and even more ways to deal with enemies.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "October 4, 2019", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Holy Moses", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK_mO2gt870", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/129888-boulder-dash-junior-iii\n"}
