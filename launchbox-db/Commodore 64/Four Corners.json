{"altername_name": [], "name": "Four Corners", "overview": "A Solitaire card game developed by Jason Olds and released as part of the FunFour game pack. Four Corners has the same basic concept as any solitaire game. It is a single-player game with a modification from the original table solitaire game. The game includes four corners along with two sides, just like a normal four-sided table. This game consists of a standard 52 card deck and does not include any additional suites or cards of any type, including the traditional trademark joker cards. You must add the opposite suite of the suite type of the card on any of the piles surrounding the center desk; there is one addition and some may consider this an advantage of this game. Whereas in the traditional solitaire you can only place cards in descending numerical value, in this version you can place cards in either descending or ascending value. Also, you can draw as often as you want from the deck but be careful, for the more cards you hold in your hand the harder it will be to place cards on the board. To win in this version of solitaire you must deplete all cards from the deck and your hand.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jason Olds", "publishers": "Softdisk Publishing", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/127620-four-corners\n"}
