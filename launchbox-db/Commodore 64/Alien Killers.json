{"altername_name": ["Killface"], "name": "Alien Killers", "overview": "Released as Killface in the 64'er Sonderheft 49, this game is an interesting cross between Arkanoid and a single screen shooter. There is on the screen a collection of blocks, but they act as a shield for the enemy rather than you! You must avoid the aliens, as you cannot destroy them and only move to the next level when you remove all the shield bricks from the screen. So shoot bricks, dodge the enemy and grab powerups that do things like give you a more powerful laser that penetrates more blocks.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Johan van Berken", "publishers": "Cubix-X Soft", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEaaKrGKFO8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/87029-alien-killers\n"}
