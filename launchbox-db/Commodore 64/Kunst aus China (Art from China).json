{"altername_name": [], "name": "Kunst aus China (Art from China)", "overview": "Game was available both as the German original and as an English translation. The story of the game is relatively bleak. After the two brothers Peter and Thomas lost their parents, they moved to a small town and opened a pizzeria there. But even there, after a while, there is no peace, because a gang of protection rackets terrorizes the whole city and demands money from the brothers. When they can no longer pay the increasingly higher protection money, the gang burns down their pizzeria. When they heard about a martial arts tournament in the city shortly afterwards, Peter challenges the leader of the gang: if he defeats him in the tournament, the gang must disappear from the city. But the leader kicks Peter illegally in the head during the fight, and so violently that he dies from it. Thomas swears vengeance on his brother's grave and sets out to free the city from the gang.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jan B.
