{"altername_name": [], "name": "Twist", "overview": "A puzzle\\brain game published in Magic Disk 64 1992/09. Explaining the goal of this puzzle game is perhaps even harder than explaining the strange user interface. On each level there are several stones (but that is also the only parallel to Perplex) that are scattered around in a disordered manner. It is your task now to bring discipline and order into this heap of pigs, i.e: all dark and all light blocks must be lined up. This is not done by simply moving it, but by a new kind of \"twist\". You can move and swap pieces in a 3 section area, but every move takes time and it is ticking by quickly!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ran System", "publishers": "CP Verlag", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4i3pWFWog9o", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/134580-twist\n"}
