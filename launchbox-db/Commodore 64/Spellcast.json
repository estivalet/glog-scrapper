{"altername_name": [], "name": "Spellcast", "overview": "An adventure game published in the Zzap! Megatape 18. It was something of a preview as it only contains a single level. The game was initially intended to be at least 3 levels with the initial forest level then a swap level and then the town area leading to a castle, inspired to some degree by Ghost n Goblins, but as they had not yet had their breakthrough hits, it got no big publishers interest despite the excellent, even great start so it was trimmed to a single finished level and published in the Megatape.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dave Clarke", "publishers": "Genesis", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/PB-hTcp1FqA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/124143-spellcast\n"}
