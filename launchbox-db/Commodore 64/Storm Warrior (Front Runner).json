{"altername_name": [], "name": "Storm Warrior (Front Runner)", "overview": "You play as a Templar-style Knight, the Storm Warrior, through various different style levels (or mini-games) including an opening gladiatorial clash with a winged demon, an atmospheric journey across the ocean to a lightning-lit island, and a battle through dank caves. Level 1 - A bat-and-ball style game in which you must deflect a glittering sphere back and forth with a winged demon. Lightning will hit the sphere if it strikes the ground. If you deflect it past the demon, you will move on to the next level. Level 2 - A beat 'em up style level. You must defeat a barbarian in a swordfight. They can only be killed by striking under the arm when it is lifted to stab downward. Level 3 - You fly toward the Island of Doom through a storm at night, as lightning flashes. Storm Birds will attack you from above during the journey. Level 4 - You descend a shaft through the rock, avoiding bats, demons and falling rocks. Level 5 - The biggest level. You must survive the catacombs, a platform-style level. Within you will encounter the Antechamber, the Chasm of Doom, the Fountains, the Tunnel of Death, the Bridge of Hope and the Chamber of Jeopardy. Finally you will reach the Chamber of Evils, where you must use your light lance to deflect yourself to the exact position to destroy the Sacred Skull.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Terry P.
