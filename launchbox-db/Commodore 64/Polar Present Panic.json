{"altername_name": [], "name": "Polar Present Panic", "overview": "This is Polar Present Panic - A free Christmas game for the Commodore 64 computer! Due to illness I didn't quite get it how I wanted it before Xmas but was determined to release before Xmas day! There will be an update in the next week or so adding the missing graphical elements. Santa is trying to get all his presents ready to deliver but a group of evil rogue elves is trying to sabotage him and sneak deadly evil presents on to the production line! You must let all the green presents through the barrier but stop any red presents or snow balls that the evil elves send your way! If you break a good present, or let a bad red present or snowball through then the temperature of the present packing machine will increase. If this gets too hot then it is game over!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2020", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mike Richmond", "publishers": "Boddicker Games", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/166404-polar-present-panic\n"}
