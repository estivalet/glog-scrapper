{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cave of the Ice Ape", "overview": "Your search was finally over.... A few months ago your true love, Maxine. left on an expedition to the Himalaya mountains. She was not heard from again. You have searched for her ever since. One day, with the snow blowing and the temperature below zero, you heard a scream coming from a cave. You looked inside the cave to find Maxine- held prisoner by a large apelike creature. Cave of the Ice Ape is a game for the C-64 which features music, sound effects, and sprite animation. Using a joystick in Port 1, your goal is to rescue Maxine as many times as you can without being hit by one of the snowballs that the Ice Ape losses down at you. In order to free Maxine, you will need three sticks of TNT. These will appear throughout the cave. Do not run into any portion of the cave, or you will blow up and lose one of the four lives you began the game with (after all, you are carrying TNT). You have only 40 seconds to collect the three sticks of TNT. If you do not collect them within the set time, you lose a life. If you do get the TNT, Maxine shows her appreciation and you receive HX points. Another rescue attempt follows, only this time the snowballs move a little faster. After each successful rescue, the snowballs pick up speed.
