{"altername_name": [], "name": "Confusing Quest", "overview": "An episodic mini-game adventure with characters very reminiscent of Creatures. This game was made by Peter Staaks and Published by Eagleware International. Scene one is balloon bombing the giant monsters that want to wreck you. Scene 2 is another mini game where you avoid the traps, get the potions and when you get enough potions you can use the cannon to shoot your way to the next level. Scene 3 shoot the monsters with your ranged weapon but don't let them get close! Scene 4 you are mirrored and must grab the stars but avoid the bombs dropped at you. Now get the code, the final scene requires you to enter it in the sky above. This is the final boss so hit him as many times as possible before he gets over you.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Peter Staaks", "publishers": "Eagleware International", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy3Ry1N3jzY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/91164-confusing-quest\n"}
