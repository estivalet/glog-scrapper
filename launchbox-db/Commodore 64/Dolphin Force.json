{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dolphin Force", "overview": "This is a top down, side scrolling space-shooter that was cancelled before official release. It was planned to have improved gameplay over Uridium with added features but development ended up taking too long. The preview stage was released and is fully playable and has some good intro music, but if it feels half done, that is because it is to some degree. It was published in Italy in Byte Games n.31 (maggio 1989) as D.
