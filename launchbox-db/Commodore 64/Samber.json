{"altername_name": [], "name": "Samber", "overview": "Samber is a platform game similar to Lode Runner. It involves players collecting a number of items in the level, while avoiding several enemies that run around. Holes can be dug through the ground and are there for the enemies to fall through to the platform below. Once all the required items have been collected, the player proceeds to the next level. In later levels, there are colored-coded doors that can be opened by using the appropriate keys. Lives are lost when the player makes contact with an enemy or falls down holes. The game features 30 levels. Previews of this game (possibly the full game as we currently know it) were released as part of GO64! 1997/05 and Commodore Scene #16.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Lepsi Developments", "publishers": "Commodore Scene", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ1g6tswO_g", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/76065-samber\n"}
