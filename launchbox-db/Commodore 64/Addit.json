{"altername_name": [], "name": "Addit", "overview": "Commodore Disk User 1988/09-10, Commodore Disk User 1988/11-12. A strategy game for two players which allows you to challenge either the computer or another human player. At first sight, it looks ridiculously simple, but you will need to look ahead very carefully to overcome the computer player. you start with a matrix of random numbers, some positive and some negative. The cursor indicates your position on the matrix, and you can move it either horizontally or vertically. You can claim the number under your cursor by hitting Return, in which case its added to or subtracted from your score. This then enables your opponent to move along thier direction, but beware - you can easily let them trap you into having to claim a negative number. The successful player will need to look ahead at least three moves. It's not easy.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "David Butcher", "publishers": "Argus Specialist Publications", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86671-addit\n"}
