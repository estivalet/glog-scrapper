{"altername_name": [], "name": "Christmas Eve (Pan Books)", "overview": "Xmas Eve is a race against time for Santa, who must rush to deliver presents before the inhabitants of the houses awake. By manoeuvering Santa\u2019s sleigh left and right you can catch the presents as they are thrown down from above by the elves. Presents can then be dropped down the chimneys by pressing the M key. Each time a present is successfully delivered, the inhabitants of the house awake and switch on the lights, which causes the snow on the roof to melt at a rate proportional to the activity in the house. The more work Santa does the more he has to hurry, in order to complete his work without being seen.
