{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Birds", "overview": "A straight-ahead shooter without much complexity. You are a grand avian being flying over a beautiful coral reef but your way is blocked by other birds, dragons and sea-salt encrusted sea creatures that leap and bite at you. Your only hope is your short-range blast attack. Send feathers flying and gain points and the ability to proceed forward on your quest. If you have a bird who's loud song has been waking you up too early in the mornings this would certainly be a way to blow off some steam as you blast these seabirds to bits. May your aim be true or the next shriek you hear could be your own!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Krystian Balion", "publishers": "Single Density Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XqS7U0RoMQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/88371-the-birds\n"}
