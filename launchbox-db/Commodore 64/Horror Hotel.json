{"altername_name": [], "name": "Horror Hotel", "overview": "A dutch language text adventure game created by John Vanderaart and released for the C64 in 1985. An expanded version would be released for the PC a few years later. You play an unnamed adventurer who gets captured by the (former) vampire Dr. A. Cula. You got knocked out and regain consciousness in a broom closet of a hotel. There is a curse on the hotel, however, so you cannot leave. As Dr. Cula appears to be up to no good, your goal is to kill Dr. Cula and lift the curse. The game is text only, but it has some helpful displays. In the upper left corner of the screen, you see a small map of all screens you have discovered for each floor of the hotel. In the upper right corner, all visible exits are displayed, as well as an index if there is a portable object. The game runs in real-time and has a time limit to complete. A constantly running counter is displayed on screen. If the timer is below a certain number, Dr. Cula will search the hotel for you.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "John Vanderaart", "publishers": "RadarSoft", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165466-horror-hotel\n"}
