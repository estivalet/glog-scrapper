Special Urban Service: Selective Elimination and Destruction. In the very near future if you cross the line SUSSED will intercept. Their hobby is death. When they are about you, don't even step on the cracks in the pavement. So when you, as one of their deadliest agents, are assigned to deliver 40 crates to a castle in London you naturally feel a little put out. The castle has a huge walled forecourt with terrible firepower to make up its defense, and motorized towers with RADAR and missile capability. Written in blood on the wall stands \"you will now suffer\". You decide not to ring the doorbell but you must follow orders. Just then, who should appear but that playboy Geoff Burton: he holds a massive yellow bird. Chain smoking, he flies at you. You see your chance and jump on the huge avian, clutching the 40 crates in your arms. You fly into the air. He jump onto his personal flying carpet and chases you! Drop 20 crates between the moving towers", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bob Kingham", "publishers": "Plasma Grafix", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2RXjx2OwWw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/101274-flying-in-on-the-big-bird\n"}
