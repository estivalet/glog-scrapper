{"altername_name": [], "name": "Coloured Deluxe", "overview": "Where the original Coloured game offered a 3x3 grid of colors and challenged you to match 3 in a row by hitting the space bar at the right time, this one offers a 4x4 grid, and challenges you to get 4 in a row! This version does support joystick use instead of all keyboard commands, which speeds things up a bit. It is almost as if this was just a game to get you to listen to his new musical composition, as Richard Bayliss also did the music for this game of chance.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1997", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Richard Bayliss", "publishers": "Binary Zone PD", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/114641-coloured-deluxe\n"}
