{"altername_name": [], "name": "Lazer Tag", "overview": "Lazer Tag is a game based on the sports brand of the same name. The real activity involves walking around with guns and trying to \"shoot\" the other players - the only significant difference to paintball is that it uses infrared guns to register hits instead of physical projectiles. This game transplants this non-violent principle into a science-fiction scenario. The player takes the role of a cadet at the Lazer Tag Academy who tries work his way up by solving laser tag challenges. Every level is played against a time limit and has the goal to score as many points as possible. However, there are two different modes: rabbitoid and target. Rabbitoid is a classical deathmatch competition (well, except that there is no death) in which the competitors move around the playing field and try to find a balance between covering from enemy shots and scoring hits. In target mode, the AI takes over the moving part and the player's role is restricted to aiming.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Probe Software", "publishers": "GO!
