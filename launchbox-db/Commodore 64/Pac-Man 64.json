{"altername_name": ["Pac-Man (Arlasoft)", "Pacman 64", "Pacman (Arlasoft)"], "name": "Pac-Man 64", "overview": "Pac-Man 64 is a faithful clone (gameplay wise) of the arcade classic of the same name for the Commodore 64. It was developed by Nick Sherman (aka Arlasoft) and published on his itch.io page on April 30, 2022. It does take some liberties with the playing field, as it uses scrolling rather than having the entire playing field on the screen at the same time. That's primarily due to the limitations of the C64 hardware. How To Play: - Move around the maze using joystick, avoiding the ghosts and collecting all the pellets. - Collect the flashing power pellets to turn the tables. Now for a brief period you can eat the frightened ghost that have turned blue. Eat all four for the maximum bonus. - Hold a direction just before a turn to 'slide' round corners and gain a speed advantage over chasing ghosts - Go through the tunnel on the edge of the map to lose a chasing ghost, as they slow down when moving through them.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "April 30, 2022", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Arlasoft", "publishers": "Arlasoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7TubNQTO0o", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162936-pac-man-64\n"}
