{"altername_name": ["Fly"], "name": "Mindwarp", "overview": "The Air Force has developed, in collaboration with a famous aeronaval construction company, a new aircraft that must be able, in the event of an attack by alien beings, to fight for the people of earth. But such a powerful and potent vehicle will be ineffective if good pilots capable of handling it are not trained. Since the conditions in which the aircraft will have to operate are for the moment still futuristic, the Air Force has built fantastic means to simulate the extraterrestrial attack and allow pilots to prepare. You too have had the opportunity to enter among these privileged ones and you have to demonstrate your skills in eliminating as many enemies as possible.
