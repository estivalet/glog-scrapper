{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dioroid", "overview": "Diorid is a puzzle solving game. The main goal requires removing all the blocks from the board within limited time. By clicking on a single spot, the player affects central field (selected one) and all the fields placed directly diagonally next to the central block by their reversal - filled block disappears and a blank spot is replaced with filled block. Basically, each taken action reverses simultaneously 5 fields, one in the middle, and 4 around.
