The winner of the competition will be used to search for precious metals on distant planets and the loser will be disposed of. The player has the task of \"flicking\" the flashing \"Glidstar\", which is located in the middle of the field, and into the opponent's goal. The opponent in turn has the option to \"hang in\" to push his adversary off his feet, then to einr\u00fcsseln the Glidstar himself. On the field is also \"Bufo\", a troublemaker who also rips the robots off his feet. The game is mainly based on the 2-player mode, but can also be played against the computer. Each robot has a spare body. The player can freely change the control of the respective body in the game.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Andreas Mettler", "publishers": "EAS Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6VrW37nEUw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/110446-limes-napoleon\n"}
