{"altername_name": [], "name": "Adults Only", "overview": "Adults only is a dice based casino game with an adult theme. A game for 2-10 people roughly equally divided in sex. Take a sip of magic potion, throw the die and move around the board to see whose clothes you can steal. Beware the Mad Mugger, who's after more clothes, but praise Kindly Jack, who gives them back again. Remember too to hold on to your modesty item - everyone has one but it can range from a blanket to a postage stamp and is easily exchangeable. All this, plus dares, truths, kisses, cuddles. You never know what you'll end up doing, or with whom! Adults only is never crude or offensive but is definitely for broadminded people only.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "R.
