{"altername_name": ["Alien Panic (Bubble Bus Software)"], "name": "Alien Panic 64", "overview": "Alien Panic 64 is a single screen platform game where the aim is to get three aliens from the top of the screen down to the bottom in the fastest time possible. Starting on the bottom of the screen you must navigate five levels of platforms above you connected by ladders with an alien moving left or right on the top level. To get the alien to the bottom of the screen you must dig a hole for the alien to fall into and you must fill the hole within a second to push the alien down a level. You keep digging and filling the holes with an alien in it till the alien falls to the bottom of the screen. Once the alien has disappeared then a new alien appears at the top of the screen again and once the three aliens have been disposed off then it is game over and your time given. If you touch an alien at any time then you are sent to the bottom of the screen wasting valuable seconds.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "The Computer Room", "publishers": "Bubble Bus Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/87030-alien-panic-64\n"}
