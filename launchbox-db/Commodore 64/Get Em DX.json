The pair have been captured and imprisoned before but managed to escape and so with confident set out for freedom. To escape, you have to eat all the crosses on the screen to make a key appear and put it in the exit lock while avoiding the various creatures that keep appearing. You can also shoot the creatures, like Trolls, Caterpillar, Bombor and Skelly, with your crossbow and infinite ammo but they take various amount of shots to kill but leave behind bonuses and power-ups when killed. If you are touched by any creature then you lose one three lives but all crosses collected don't reappear. The power-ups that can be collected help you in your game and these include extra time, smart bomb, extra life and speed up. Shooting Bombor destroys anything nearby including power-ups and expands the walls slightly. Each maze has to be completed within a time limit and if the time runs out then a Mad Bat appears and chases you. Before you start a game you can select a difficulty level which are Easy, Normal or Hard and each new game has a different random maze. Two players can play and both players play on the screen at the same time co-operating to collect all the crosses.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2012", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Georg Rottensteiner", "publishers": "Psytronik Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQZbVKQnAGk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/102133-get-em-dx\n"}
