{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Revenge of Moriarty", "overview": "Designed as a small, four-location adventure, you played Sherlock Holmes, trapped in his consulting rooms by Moriarty's goons, and had to lay a tray to snare your archnemesis and save your own life. A conversion from a Spectrum game released in 1989, and reworked and released by the original game author in 2019. 'You are the world's most famous detective. After your recent successes on the continent you could've retired and spent your time engaged in academic research. But for many years something has been bothering you. You felt as if a veil of darkness was descending over London. To anyone else the wave of unsolved, and often even unreported crimes, would appear unconnected. But you spotted patterns. You realised that they'd all been meticulously planned and directed by the same unknown hand. You followed the threads of crime until the spider at the centre of the web was revealed. The mastermind behind it all. You vowed that you would not rest until he was stopped. You have worked tirelessly to this end these past few months. Now, the plan is in motion. The trap is in place. Soon the capital will be free of the menace that has plagued its streets for so long. But he is aware. He knows you are poised to strike. He has put his own agents to work. He will be coming for you. You need to be ready.'", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "October 21, 2019", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gareth Pitchford", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/130641-the-revenge-of-moriarty\n"}
