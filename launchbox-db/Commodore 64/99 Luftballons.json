{"altername_name": ["99 Luft-Ballons"], "name": "99 Luftballons", "overview": "99 Luftballons is a strange little game for the Commodore 64, which also seems like a take on one of the Minigames in Lazy Jones and the game's name obviously inspired by the 80s German pop music hit of the same name. Grab the balloons to make it to your home at the top of the screen, as the ladder on the left-hand side of the screen is broken. There's a blue enemy that shoots arrows at the balloons to try to bust it while you're going up. The game was developed by Mario Walther and released into the public domain in 1985.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mario Walther", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqz9HeKHDdA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/160796-99-luftballons\n"}
