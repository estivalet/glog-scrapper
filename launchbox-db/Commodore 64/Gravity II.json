{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gravity II", "overview": "Lunar lander game sequel with playability improvements. The object of this game is to land your saucer on to the landing pad , but watch out for the deadly alien ships. Collide into one of those and your space ship will become smashed.To make things more challenging, the landing pad this time round moves left and right. Quite a funny idea, but makes gameplay much difficult and fun. Plenty of hardcore SID techno music this time round.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2000", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Richard Bayliss", "publishers": "The New Dimension (TND)", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/102805-gravity-ii\n"}
