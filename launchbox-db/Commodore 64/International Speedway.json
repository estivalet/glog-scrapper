There is no brake, but once per race a special boost can be activated by pushing the joystick forward.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Probe Software", "publishers": "Silverbird Software", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8UZ3UrnmkE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106564-international-speedway\n"}
