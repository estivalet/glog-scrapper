Try to avoid the myriad dangers and reach the rescue base. An uninhabited planet, its surface thick with impenetrable clouds of poison gas, but mineral resources under ground could not be ignored. The planet, named Acorn could be mined and the caves used for habitation. But when attackers came, they turned the defenses back towards us and now the only hope the hostages have is if we can penetrate the alien-upgraded defenses and save our people!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Markt & Technik", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90389-cave-of-death\n"}
