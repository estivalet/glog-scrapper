{"altername_name": [], "name": "Descent to Kaylon", "overview": "An Action game by Steve Stiglich published in COMPUTE!'s Gazette 1984/11 (Issue #17). Gliding asteroids and a layer of clouds separate you from your supply base on Planet Kaylon. Is safe passage possible? For the VIC and 64. Cruising over Planet Kaylon in your spaceship, you spot a supply base below. But as soon as you send off a shuttle ship to the base, a cluster of asteroids sails across its path. Darting quickly through the asteroids and clouds, your shuttle narrowly escapes collision before touching down on Kaylon,", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Steve Stiglich", "publishers": "COMPUTE!
