Along the way, snakes block the way and they must be killed with the players' throwing knife. When they leave whatever screen they killed the snake on and then re-enter the screen, the snakes are resurrected and the player has to kill them again. Points are awarded for killing a snake. The game ends when the player gets eaten.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jean-Francois Heon", "publishers": "Ion International, Inc.", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86697-the-adventurer\n"}
