{"altername_name": [], "name": "Calvin", "overview": "In this game, players control Calvin, whose task is to rid the caverns of various enemies including flying robot hats and green dinosaurs. Players start off wearing a sleeveless blue suit which has no weapons, leaving them with no choice but to jump over these enemies. However, there are two types of pads that can be stepped on to give you different suits, and these suits give you weapons which can be used to destroy the enemies with. When killed, most of the dinosaurs will drop a flashing P icon, and when it is collected, the suit will flash for a few seconds and the player can use a pulse rifle to destroy everything in their path. Vines and jump pads can be used to reach higher platforms. Regardless of what suit the player is wearing, it will change back to blue if they take enough hits. At the end of each cavern is a boss that needs to be defeated for Calvin to proceed to the next cavern.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "ECP (Entertainment and Computer Products Pty.
