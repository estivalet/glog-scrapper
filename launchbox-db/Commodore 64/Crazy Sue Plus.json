{"altername_name": [], "name": "Crazy Sue Plus", "overview": "A scrolling screen platformer by M. Bietz, Gerard Hultink & Elton de Hoog and released by Bomico in and updated \"Plus\" version in 1993. Sue got lost in a dark, magical forest and is now desperately looking for an exit. Unfortunately, the cunning and mean inhabitants of the dense wooded area thwart her plans. Since Susi has no weapons to defend herself against the nasty figures, she has to withdraw without further ado and jump over them. The numerous monsters see through this quickly and for this reason attack in various formations that are very difficult to penetrate.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Elton de Hoog", "publishers": "Bomico Entertainment Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJsp3imFGA8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/94421-crazy-sue-plus\n"}
