{"altername_name": ["American Ice Hockey"], "name": "Superstar Ice Hockey", "overview": "In Superstar Ice Hockey you control one of 20 Canadian & US teams. The game has no license so you can't play with the stars. There are 4 divisions with 5 teams. After the regular season the best 2 teams of each division are qualified for the playoffs. Worth mentioning is that you are playing always the center - the other players are controlled by the CPU. In the multiplayer mode you can only play friendly games.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "DesignStar Consultants", "publishers": "Databyte", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.63", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superstar_Ice_Hockey", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/31832-superstar-ice-hockey\n"}
