You control Bart the Bumblebee by giving him instructions on how to move from flower to flower, picking up pollen points.

If Bart returns safely to the beehive before the time runs out, bonus points are awarded followed by a colorful graphics display.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Greg Brewer", "publishers": "Creative Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90208-bumblebee\n"}
