{"altername_name": ["Metro-Cross", "Metrocross"], "name": "Metro Cross", "overview": "Metro-Cross is a platform game where the player must run through 32 futuristic levels. He is given a time limit to run through each one while avoiding obstacles and collecting items. The actual running happens automatically, the job of the player is to dodge obstacles and collect items by moving the character sideways and adjusting the speed. If the character finishes the race within the time limit, the remaining time is converted into bonus points and he moves on to the next track. Every fourth track is a special track, which uses the time left over from the previous three as additional time. However, if the character hasn't reached the finish line when the time limit is up, the game is over.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Probe Software", "publishers": "Kixx", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.67", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro-Cross", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gS_1MoEEtF0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6240-metro-cross\n"}
