{"altername_name": [], "name": "Drip Drop", "overview": "Published in Personal Computer News #102 (09.03.1985). In this game you are a garedner, desperately trying to keep your flowers growing in time of drought. Luckily, a cloud is passing overhead and it starts to rain. You grab your watering can and run out underneath the cloud to catch the sparse raindrops. All the time you empty the can onto the flower, which grows. When the rain stops you'll either have watered it enough to progress or you will have to start over.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "March 9, 1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Zachariah Jones", "publishers": "PCN (Personal Computer News) Magazine", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/97688-drip-drop\n"}
