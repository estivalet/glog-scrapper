{"altername_name": [], "name": "Infection", "overview": "\u201cInfection\u201d was originally started by Wise Owl Software in 1988 who came up with the concept which was a twist on the board game Reversi. Virgin bought all the rights for Infection and started working on improving the AI. Additionally they contracted David Whittaker to produce the music for all the conversions. Although Virgin liked the game and were excited by their budget game prospect, they felt that with a coin op version in the wings a budget version would\u2019ve devalued a possible coin op version. As a result, the budget version was pulled just before release. In 1990 Virgin later struck a deal with 7Up and recycled the Infection game into a new title called \u201cSpot\u201d. Additionally the game was also licenced to Leland Corporation, whom took the game and brought out an arcade version called \u201cAtaxx\u201d, which was very faithful to the Amiga original. Rights these days to the game are a bit confused as a result. Sadly it meant that the original \u201cInfection\u201d title was laid to rest. In 2009, one of the original developers got nostalgic, compiled the original source code and so finally we had the original game in its full glory!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Craig Galley", "publishers": "Virgin Mastertronic", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JbA45YX7Hw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106514-infection\n"}
