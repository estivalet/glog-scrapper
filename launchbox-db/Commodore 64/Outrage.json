{"altername_name": [], "name": "Outrage", "overview": "In the tradition of \"Hawkeye\", you are steering a hero through a number of platform levels. In a shop you can obtain different weapons. Outrage inspires through colorful graphics and great design. Outrage was produced by Cosmos Designs for the Boeder Talent Competition in cooperation with the 64'er magazine a long time ago. However, it was not released back then. We in Protovision bought the rights to distribute the game from Bernd Buchegger, who supplied us with the remnants of the game \u2013 of course without source codes and with a few bugs and glitches we'd liked to get fixed before a release. However, we were lacking the resources to work on this game, so we were looking for help. Psytronik came along and showed interest in finalizing and distributing the game, but they, too, were facing the same problems as we did. Thanks to everyone involved in this project, we can finally announce that Outrage has been completed! Features: - 5 levels fully packed with finest arcade action (Hawkeye style) - Each level with a monstrous end boss - A shop to buy ammunition, smartbombs and more - Colorful graphics, animations and special effects - Beautifully crafted SID in-game music and sfx - Title picture from STE'86 (Steve Day) - PAL and NTSC compatible", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "December 14, 2020", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Cosmos Designs", "publishers": "Protovision", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1fnwq_KQlU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/146126-outrage\n"}
