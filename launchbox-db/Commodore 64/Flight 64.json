{"altername_name": [], "name": "Flight 64", "overview": "A civil flight simulation game by Brian Lawer and released in 1982 by Fantasy Computerware. You've just been hired by Airsik Flight Service to pick up a patient from a nearby airport and fly him safely back for an emergency treatment. It's 2:00 AM so you will have to rely on the instrument panel for all your information. The gauges will display altitude, air speed, vertical speed, R.P.M., heading and fuel supply. On the top right corner of the display you will see the artificial horizon which shows your angle of climb and bank. The radar map in the center of the panel shows your position as the flashing dot in respect to the blue squares, which are airports and the nearby mountains. Go through pre-flight check, release the chocks and start your engines!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Brian Lawer", "publishers": "Fantasy Computerware", "genres": "Flight Simulator", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/101227-flight-64\n"}
