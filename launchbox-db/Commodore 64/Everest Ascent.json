{"altername_name": [], "name": "Everest Ascent", "overview": "Everest Ascent is a strategy resource management game where the player is the leader of an expedition attempting to climb Mount Everest. With a limited starting fund of \u00a31000, the player must juggle expenses to hire sherpas, purchase equipment that may be useful in the ascent (tents, ropes, planks), as well as rations to keep everyone fed. Able to set up various base camps on the way up, the progress of the player's expedition may also result in donations being given to the player to help his efforts (which the player can find out about if he pays out for a radio for the expedition). Of course, collecting such donations and gathering new supplies and sherpas will require returning to village to collect them. Can you keep everyone alive and strong enough to reach the summit?", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "January 1, 1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Will Brighton", "publishers": "Richard Shepherd Software", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/32386-everest-ascent\n"}
