{"altername_name": ["Frog 64"], "name": "Squash a Frog", "overview": "Getting home for poor frog is nothing but a tale of catastrophe and in the superb version of the classic game you can experience every heart-stopping moment, every danger-filled second. Cross four lanes of fast-moving traffic, only to be eaten by a snake; traverse the rapids, leaping from submerging turtles to swirling logs, avoiding the snapping alligators and foreboding river banks on the way, only to find that once you're home you have to do it four more times. Make five frogs happy and you'll progress to the next level of difficulty.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Antony Crowther", "publishers": "Alligata Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDSZEHEdosA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/101697-squash-a-frog\n"}
