Your starship \"The Excalibur' slowly drifts through intergalactic space on course for Earth. You are quietly relaxing at the starship controls, whilst enjoying a bottle of 50 year old Scotch in celebration of the completion of yet another dangerous mission. As you take your first gulp of the glorious liquor (drink responsibly), you sense movement from the rear of the ship. Suddenly, you feel a stabbing pain in your back AAAAARGHHH!!!! A tranquilizer dart... You reach for your blaster and turn to meet your attacker, but the dart takes effect and you collapse in a heap on the floor, truly unconscious. As you fall, you hear the gloating voice of your attacker. \"You'll never escape this time, SID!!! When you awaken, you find yourself stranded on a strange planet. Your mission: Return home safely.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "C.
