{"altername_name": [], "name": "Diamond Mine", "overview": "The goal of Diamond Mine is to collect as many diamonds as possible from 20 underground shafts. Each is presented as a single screen with corridors and alleyways. Monsters are released at intervals from a Pacman-style hub, these can be shot. The mines are covered in dust initially; until you have walked through an area, a bullet can't be fired through it. Contact with a monster loses all your gems, so the best strategy is to shoot them out first - as most diamonds are down corridors, this can be planned for. You can start from one of 5 different screens.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "IDSI", "publishers": "Roklan", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UlQt7tc01c", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/96503-diamond-mine\n"}
