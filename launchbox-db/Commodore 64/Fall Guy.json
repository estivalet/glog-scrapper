{"altername_name": [], "name": "Fall Guy", "overview": "This is a game for two, in which each player directs a small figure down a vertical maze so that it can drop through a hole in the moving floor at the bottom. The figure is maneuvered through the maze by directing markers up and down the outer walls and shifting horizontal sections of the maze to the left or right, allowing the figures to drop through to lower levels. The trick is to alter the internal pattern of the maze in order to move your own figure without at the same time opening up advantages for the opposition.
