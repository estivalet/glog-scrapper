{"altername_name": [], "name": "Scorpion (Rack-It)", "overview": "The Scorpion battle machine is a new anti-terrorist device. Scorpion is being tested in a simulated refinery sabotage scenario. You move Scorpion along a network of pipelines, collecting bombs as you move along. Avoid the moving obstacles and shoot all bomb layers to clear the current level and move on to the next one. Since Scorpion can only move along the pipelines, you have to plan your way through each level carefully in order to avoid all those moving enemies. Fortunately, they move along in repetitive patterns and don't chase you. Gameplay is not easy because you have to very precisely take turns at the junctions. The game features Parallax scrolling.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mark Washbrook", "publishers": "Rack-It", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.80", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNW6S60m2xU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/112168-scorpion-rack-it\n"}
