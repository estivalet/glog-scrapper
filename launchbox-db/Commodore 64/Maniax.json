{"altername_name": [], "name": "Maniax", "overview": "Maniax is a Qix variant. The basic playing principle: the player controls a dot which can draw lines on the screen and when a closed figure is drawn, the color of the area changes. Additionally there are enemies, either confined to the uncolored or colored areas, which cause the player sprite to die if touched. The goal is to color 75% of the screen.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "J\u00f6rg Dierks", "publishers": "Kingsoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45mLLjtvRok", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/110500-maniax\n"}
