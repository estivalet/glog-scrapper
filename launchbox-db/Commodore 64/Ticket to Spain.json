{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ticket to Spain", "overview": "Ticket to Spain is an educational game designed to teach players about Spanish language and culture through exploration of the country. As the player explores, they receive tasks, including visiting specific locations and seeing famous monuments. More mundane tasks are included, such as going to a restaurant, grocery stores, or department store to purchase a specific item in Spanish. The player can even go to the horse tracks to gamble. Whenever the player completes a specific task, they are given a clue to the identity of a famous Spanish person. Once the player gathers sufficient clues to guess their identity, they can return to the airport, and if they correctly guess the individual, they can leave Spain.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Blue Lion Software", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/123786-ticket-to-spain\n"}
