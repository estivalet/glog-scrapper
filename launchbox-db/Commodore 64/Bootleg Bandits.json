{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bootleg Bandits", "overview": "You are a Bootlegger and in your heavily armed armoured car you carry illegal Scotch to customers along various highways. Obviously the police and local authorities aren't happy with your line of business so set out to stop and destroy you. Bootleg Bandits is a side view scrolling driving game where the screen scrolls from left to right when you drive your car. As you drive various police cars and helicopters appear from either side of the screen shooting their weapons or crash into you but you are equipped with a radar to see which way their are appearing. You are armed with forward firing missiles as well as smoke which fires from the back and destroys vehicles. Missiles and other weapons are shot at you but you also have the ability to jump great distances through the air. If you are hit by anything then you explode and a damage meter increases and when this is full then it is game over. You also have to keep an eye on a fuel meter which decreases as you drive but their are balloons that appear carrying fuel and you jump into the air to refuel. If you run out of fuel then you come to a stop and a plane appears and blows you up. Once you get to a customer you watch him get drunk and fall over and it then on to the next one facing the same dangers. Before you start the game you can select a skill level (1-5).", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Don Rigby", "publishers": "Scorpio Gamesworld", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/89817-bootleg-bandits\n"}
