{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dungeon of Namos", "overview": "An arcade style maze game created by Mike Clore and published in 1986 in Loadstar #031. In this arcade-style maze game, you must fight you way through and evil horde to find the object of your quest: the Circlet of Power. The circlet is hidden somewhere in the maze-like passages of the dungeon. Once you attain it, victory is not far away. In your quest you must gather up keys, power rods that give you extra attacking power and potions that give you extra lives. Teleport chambers take you from room to room. Hindering your quest are the evil spider-like Phamon and the strange, fast-moving Blyks. Teleportation chambers will transport you to a random room, however, if you stay in a room and pick it clean a key will appear, which will let you move through the door to a specific room.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mike Clore", "publishers": "Softdisk Publishing, Inc.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/97917-dungeon-of-namos\n"}
