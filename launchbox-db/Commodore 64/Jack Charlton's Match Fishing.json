{"altername_name": [], "name": "Jack Charlton's Match Fishing", "overview": "Those of you who know Jack Charlton from his days as Republic of Ireland football manager may think this game is about his habit of investigating the histories of English footballers in the hope of finding a solitary Irish grandparent so as to qualify the player for his team. In reality however, he's also known for his love of fishing. Up to 8 players can join in, each of whom are awarded a 'peg' - essentially a random position along a lake. The types of fish you are likely to face in each area are detailed before you start - pike, roach and bream are among the most common. Using this information you can decide which type of rod to use, choose your bait, and decide how deep to fish - experts in the subject will be fine here. During the main part of the game, one of the 8 bays will flash - the player fishing form this peg must press the relevant number as quickly as possible, then watch a short animation depicting the result, which is a function of how quickly you press the key, and of whether you have the right equipment.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Alligata Software", "publishers": "Alligata Software", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "8", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82hMN8izvLs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106770-jack-charltons-match-fishing\n"}
