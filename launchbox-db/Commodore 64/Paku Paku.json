But its Paku Paku which means flap your mouth. But, you know, they thought people would scratch out the \"p\" and turn it into an \"f\". Based on original PacMan map reduced to use 3x3 tiles instead of 8x8. This preserves the aspect ratio, map and scoring of the original game. It was never fully completed and as good as it looks, ghost collision was never fully implemented.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2012", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jason M.
