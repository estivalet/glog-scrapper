{"altername_name": [], "name": "3D Tic-Tac-Toe (COMPUTE! Publications, Inc.)", "overview": "Published in COMPUTE!'s Gazette 1984/06 (Issue #12), as well in Keypunch's Strategy Games, and in Europe by Wicked Software in the Big 100 Collection. Sound, color, and a three-dimensional playing board add new excitement to this old familiar game. After the title screen is displayed, both players enter their names and how many games they want to play. A multicolored three-dimensional tic-tac-toe board then appears on the screen. The player with the joystick in port 1 goes first. To move the cursor, in the top left corner of the board, push the joystick left or right. When you get to the desired location, push the fire button and your marker will appear under the cursor. If there is already a marker in the space, a low noise will be heard, and you will have to go elsewhere. Winning Combinations: To win, you must get three of your markers in a straight line before your opponent does. They can be on one of the boards, or a combination of the three boards going diagonally or up and down. When you get a tic-tac-toe, your three pieces flash different colors and the winning sound is heard. The board is then cleared, and, if you specified more than one round in the beginning, you play again. If not, the score is displayed and the game is over.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mark Doyle", "publishers": "COMPUTE!
