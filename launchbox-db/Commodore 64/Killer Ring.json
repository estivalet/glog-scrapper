{"altername_name": ["Killer-Ring", "K-Ring"], "name": "Killer Ring", "overview": "The idea behind the game is to shoot anything that moves, this does not include family pets (except poodles). If it moves, shoot it, if it doesn't, shoot if anyway. If by some freak chance you should reach the spaceman, then blow out his heart for some extra bonus points! Each time you play, difficulty increases!
