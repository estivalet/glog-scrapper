{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hyper Harvest", "overview": "Harvest fruit as fast possible to score points and prevent them leaving the top of the screen. Each time a fruit leaves the screen the row is cleared but a life is lost. Matching fruits can be harvested in pairs horizontally, vertically, or diagonally by selecting them with the cursor and pressing fire. However, they can only be cleared if they are either next to each other or there is clear space between them. After 8 pairs are cleared, the level (and speed) increases. Clearing an entire row of fruit will move all fruit above it down one row.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "February 4, 2023", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Arlasoft", "publishers": "Arlasoft", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr6Qb3l4U7M", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/169113-hyper-harvest\n"}
