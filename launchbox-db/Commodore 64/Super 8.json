{"altername_name": [], "name": "Super 8", "overview": "A numerical puzzle game for the Commodore 64 made by Gilles Drouin in 1989 and published by Softdisk Publishing, Inc. in Loadstar #063. A puzzle involving eight numbers, eight squares and you. A deceptively simple puzzle that will keep you stumped for a large number of seconds depending on you and your logical abilities. The game is timed, so you will know exactly how much time that is for you. Your job is to place the numbers 1 through 8 in the squares in such a way that no number touches (vertically, horizontally or diagonally) another consecutive number. The one cannot touch the 2 and the 2 cannot touch the 3, etc. When you think you have one of the possible solutions press RETURN and you will know if you've done it correctly or not.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gilles Drouin", "publishers": "Softdisk Publishing", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/124356-super-8\n"}
