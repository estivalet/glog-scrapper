{"altername_name": [], "name": "Spider", "overview": "A platformer created by Marcus Beyer & Fernando Munoz and published in Input 64 1987/07. \"Last night I dreamed of spiders again!\"-\"ugh!\"- Do you also feel that spiders are disgusting? At least they make you shiver, these hairy little multi-legged creatures. Not so \"Spiders\". You control a small spider -- using a joystick or keyboard -- through a confusing maze. On the way to the end point you have to collect 24 keys, because you need them to get a reward. Don't make this collection action too easy, though, because there are nasty traps built into the maze all along the way that the spider can't jump over. The only way to do this is to go back, if that is possible, because at a certain point it even ends up in a dead end. Then nothing works anymore. In some places there are small holes through which she can slip and get to a different position in the maze. If at any point nothing is running at all, just talk the spider into jumping. Some areas have built in overhangs or stairs for her to crawl up. Where these places are in the labyrinth is not revealed. By the way, Spider is a nice game with a cute little spider that I'm sure you'll all grow fond of soon.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "July 1, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Fernando Munoz", "publishers": "Input 64", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdbLwfuQHQA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/167963-spider\n"}
