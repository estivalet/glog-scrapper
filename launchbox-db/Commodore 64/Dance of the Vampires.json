{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dance of the Vampires", "overview": "With a jolt you wake, reaching from your subconscious mind for a pencil and a clean sheet of paper from the desk. Fumbling about with your fingers, however, you find not stationery, but the icicle-covered sleeve of uncle's coast. Upon opening your eyes, the puzzle is solved. No longer are you in uncle's study at Koenigsberg University, taking notes and generally keeping busy helping uncle. You are now heading up a narrow track that winds on through gradually deepening woods and snow, on another one of uncle's \u201cfield trips\u201d. This time researching a book on vampire bats and their connection with a strange race of humans. This is of course of little interest to you, being neither of a very adventurous nature or possession of a strange stomach. However, the strange wolf cries coming from the trees around you and the general air of expectancy does grip you in a frightening sort of way. Dance of the Vampires is an adventure game split into three chapters. The screen consist of the picture of the location that players are presently at, a description of that location, and a prompt where commands are entered. Recognizable commands include EXAMINE, TAKE, DRINK, ASK ABOUT, and directions can be abbreviated (ie: N, S, E, W, U, D).", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Martin Westwood", "publishers": "Interactive Technology", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75466-dance-of-the-vampires\n"}
