{"altername_name": ["Euchre"], "name": "Euchre (Compute! Publications)", "overview": "Euchre is a four-handed translation of the popular card game of the same name. In this version, you play with a computer partner against 2 computer opponents. The computer will deal the cards, keep score and play your partner's as well as your opponent's hands. Even better, it never gets bored or commits blunders such as trumping your ace. Nearly all the subtleties of the original card game are reproduced faithfully, including lone hands, short suits and more. You can even choose different personalities for your partner and opponents.
