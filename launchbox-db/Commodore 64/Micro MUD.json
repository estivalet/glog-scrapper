{"altername_name": ["MicroMud"], "name": "Micro MUD", "overview": "If you've wanted to play the multi user game Multi User Dungeon but didn't have a modem then here is your chance. The game plays like the original except instead of human players the computer creates and plays as the humans. The aim of the game is to become a wizard by scoring 102400 points. This is done by killing other players, performing minor tasks or collecting treasure. To save your treasure you must put it in the swamp. There are over 400 locations with a database of 100 characters but only 10 play at a time. Watch out though, there are 112 baddies out there to make things harder. With only 250 treasures to locate and collect by 10 players, the treasure soon goes so the game resets. Any treasure you do not have in the swamp is lost forever. The game is played in the style of a text-adventure with no graphics. Putting in commands directs your character who can interact with the other players. The game is played in real-time as you watch characters come and go in one location.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jon.
