{"altername_name": [], "name": "GR9 Strike Force", "overview": "Pilot briefing: take control of your GR9 harrier jet and navigate through the terrorist occupied territory. Your task is to clear the way for ground forces by destroying as many of their land and air defenses as possible. The GR9 Harrier can be controlled with a joystick connected to port 2 and the run stop key will pause the assault at any point when the player is in control of the plane. Pressing the Q key from pause mode will abort the current mission. GR9 Strike Force was developed for the Retro Reunited event (12th to 13th September 2009) in Huddersfield, U.K. and stars the lucky winner of a door prize at the event, who was given a silly hat to wear before being photographed, converted and inserted into the game (and \"loading\" picture) live at the event by T.M.R! Developed by Cosine Systems at the recent Retro Reunited event, GR9 Strike Force is a shoot-'em-up on the Commodore 64. Your mission is to go into enemy territory and take out their land and air defenses, paving the way for your ground forces to move in.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "September 14, 2009", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Cosine Systems", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzXFLNnr-oM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/102634-gr9-strike-force\n"}
