{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mega-Apocalypse", "overview": "It is the sequel to Crazy Comets. The game involves repetitively shooting planets and moons as they grow in size and threaten to collide with the player's space ship. The game is noted for its Rob Hubbard music, fast paced action and 2 player co-op game play. It is a very strange universe really - isn\u00b4t it? All those millions of planets and moons and stars and comets swirling about in the vastness of space. Imagine what fun it would be to explore - to boldly go where no boldly goer had boldly gone before - unless they happened to live there. Latest research from the Institute of Advanced Research (I.A.R.) indicated that there are quite a lot of planets with things living on them. Some of these things are pretty intelligent like us really. Other of these things are really stupid, like whelks, for example. Anyway, to cut a long story short, you have been selected to explore the universe, boldly seeking out strange and exciting new worlds. If you find any, your instructions are quite clear.
