{"altername_name": [], "name": "Agent Orange", "overview": "Eight planets have been infected by a strange weed planted by an alien life form. The weed is sucking the life out of the planet and needs to be destroyed. You control a ship with Agent Orange on board which when planted will kill the weed. When you land on a planet you can see the killer weed growing. Alien fighters try and stop you sowing Agent Orange. Any fighter destroyed leave behind a seed. Collect the seeds but be careful as carrying too many seeds cause your ship to crash. Agent Orange is a horizontally scrolling top down view shoot-em-up. You can move the screen left and right. The joystick steers the ship while the fire button shoots your weapons. Holding down the fire button releases the Agent Orange.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Argus Press Software", "publishers": "Quicksilva", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_Orange_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7UbvzrYp0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86756-agent-orange\n"}
