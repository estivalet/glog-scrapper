{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dinky Doo", "overview": "Dinky Doo is a single screen game viewed from above where you are in a nightmare due to a cheese sandwich you had eaten before bed, even though your Mother said not to. The only way out of this bad dream is to complete various levels to reach the safety of your Mother's room by collecting your hot milk on each screen. Each screen has walls and various creatures that move around the screen and if you touch the walls or a creature then you lose one of three lives. If you reach your hot milk then some of the creatures turn to cherries and these can be collected as you head towards a door that has appeared. On later levels there are lasers that turn on and off and are deadly to the touch. An oxygen bar decreases and fills up when you collect the milk and starts decreasing again as you go to the door, and this just gives you bonus points when the level is completed.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Damian McComb", "publishers": "Software Projects", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.8", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIMOZMSPiDs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/96516-dinky-doo\n"}
