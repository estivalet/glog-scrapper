{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mr. Cool", "overview": "In Mr. Cool, designed by Peter Oliphant in 1983, the player needs to change the colors of platforms to a designated color by jumping on them. With the playing field shaped as a pyramid, the player has enemies coming at him both horizontally and from the top down during 15 rounds of increasing difficulty. After one level of 15 rounds, the game repeats itself with increased speed. Peter, who loved the game Q*Bert, released by Atari in 1982, felt that it could use some improvements, and designed Mr. Cool as a result. Hence why it's often considered a clone, though it features several differences and is actually much harder to play.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Peter Oliphant", "publishers": "Sierra On-Line", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU0aCHF2N_w", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109753-mr-cool\n"}
