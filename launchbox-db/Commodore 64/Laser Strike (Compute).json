{"altername_name": [], "name": "Laser Strike (Compute)", "overview": "Published in COMPUTE! 1986/12 (Issue #79), and also in COMPUTE!'s Third Book of C64. In this strategy game for one or two players, your mission is to locate and vaporize your opponent's hidden space force before your force suffers the same fate. \"Laser Strike\" is a strategy game based on several popular board games (Battleship is probably the most famous). However, unlike the board games, the action in Laser Strike occurs in outer space. Two players secretly deploy their space-ships around the galaxy and then try to locate the opponent's ships by firing laser strikes on the two-dimensional galaxy grid. The first player to find and destroy all the opponent's ships is the winner.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Barbara H.
