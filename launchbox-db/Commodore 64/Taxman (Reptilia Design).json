{"altername_name": [], "name": "Taxman (Reptilia Design)", "overview": "Two things are certain - Death and Taxes and in this game both are assured. In this single screen at a time Platform game, you guide Humfrey through the land of N.O.D., collecting tax on the hay. Destroy all Herberts to stay alive. To survive the land of Nods you must collect the Hods (coins from Nods) and if at first you don't succeed just restart. Created by Warren Mills of Ninja Warriors and Saint Dragon fame. This game would eventually inspire the 1994 release called Cashman by Russ Michaels.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Warren Mills", "publishers": "Reptilia Design", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4LktIpG4oI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/150600-taxman-reptilia-design\n"}
