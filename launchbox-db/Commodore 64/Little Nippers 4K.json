The next day it is a beautiful day. The crabs were still sleeping until those pesky kids on holiday, start running amok on the beach. The crabs are grumpy and they want to have their revenge. You are the lord of the crabs using a spacebar or the fire button. The object of this game is to launch your crab onto those pesky kids and nip their feet. If the crab misses their feet, it will end up into the sea, and will be lost. Points scored are based on the distance the crab has to travel. The further the distance, the more number of points it can score. The game is over when all of your crabs are lost.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "July 1, 2022", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hugues Poisseroux", "publishers": "The New Dimension (TND)", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-WBMX7jpWg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/163709-little-nippers-4k\n"}
