{"altername_name": [], "name": "You Have to Win the Game", "overview": "A platform game with a simple goal, as its title points out. It's easier said than done, though - You Have to Win the Game focuses on exploration and tricky puzzles, making the task anything but straightforward. The subterranean game world twists from room to interconnected room of deadly pits, spikes, water bodies, moving pads, bizarre vegetation and unusual wildlife; the path is riddled with inaccessible areas, reachable only through finding some hidden device or object elsewhere in the depths - which may, in turn, block off other areas. Teleports, secret passages and strange spatial warps make the journey even more non-linear.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2012", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "J.
