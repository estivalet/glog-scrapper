Ninja, Shoguns. warriors and soldiers lie in ambush. Savage animals prowl and prey upon intruders. At the culmination of this quest lies the volcano fortress of the evil warlord, ruling the blighted land from behind a deadly defence of mercenary guards and traps. The warlord can only be destroyed by a true Fist Master! Fist II: The Legend Continues defies classification.
