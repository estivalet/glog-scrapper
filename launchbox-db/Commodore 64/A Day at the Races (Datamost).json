{"altername_name": [], "name": "A Day at the Races (Datamost)", "overview": "Published as part of the Commodore 64 Game Construction Kit. In A Day at the Races, we present a horse race betting simulation which does not require you to sell your house to step up to the betting window. The prime goal of this game is to give the player at least a little bit of the feel and excitement of going to the track. Parimutuel betting is a much more complex system than what we use in A Day at the Races; however, the essential elements of chance combined with strategy and experience are present.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "William L.
