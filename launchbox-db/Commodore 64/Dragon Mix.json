{"altername_name": ["Arcademic Skillbuilder: Dragon Mix"], "name": "Dragon Mix", "overview": "The Dragon is a large, mythological beast, having four separate, and of course therefore quite distinctive legs, and a monstrous body with thousands of tiny scales. At one end of the large, monstrous body, we find an almost equally monstrous head, with two flaming nostrils. In this game you'll find a variety of math problems and use you increasing math skills to defend your dragon and progress in the game. For instance solving division and multiplication problems will stop the incoming rocket barrage and allow you to advance. Keep improving and remember that the dragon scales are tipped in your favor!
