{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mind Games", "overview": "Published in Commodore Disk User 1988/07-08, as well as Your Commodore 1991/03 (Tape #15), and GO64! 2005/10. Explore the president's brain and find out what kind of guy is entrusted with the button to end all civilization. A summit conference of the world's two military giants is scheduled for tomorrow, but for no very good reason the US president has gone totally insane. Well, not totally insane, one coherent idea remains alive deep within his subconscious. It is your mission, should you accept it, to guide this small bubble of sanity through the labyrinth of the president's mind, destroying insane thoughts and opening the doors of reason. Ultimately you must find the exit from his subconscious and enter the president's conscious mind, restoring his sanity. The president's subconscious is made up of a 10 x 16 grid of 256 rooms. Each room is full of insane thoughts which must be blasted. When a certain number of thoughts have been destroyed (this number is different for each room) the doors will begin to open. The player can then pass through these into the next room, and when the exit is reached, sanity is restored.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Homer A.
