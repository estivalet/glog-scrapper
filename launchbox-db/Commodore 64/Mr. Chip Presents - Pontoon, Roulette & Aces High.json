{"altername_name": ["3 Games of Chance", "Pontoon, Roulette & Aces High"], "name": "Mr. Chip Presents: Pontoon, Roulette & Aces High", "overview": "A collection of 3 games; Pontoon, a card game that is a relative of blackjack. British pontoon uses the terms \"twist\" (hit), \"stick\" (stand) and \"buy\" (double the bet, not to be confused with doubling down) and a different set of rules. The rules for buying in pontoon include allowing the player to buy on any hand of 2 to 4 cards, allowing the player to twist after he buys. Roulette: In the game, players may choose to place bets on either a single number or the colors red or black, . To determine the winning number and color, a croupier spins a wheel in one direction, then spins a ball in the opposite direction around a tilted circular track running around the outer edge of the wheel. The ball eventually loses momentum, passes through an area of deflectors, and falls onto the wheel and into one of 20 numbered and colored slots (not the normal 37 or 8). Aces High: Deal four cards, face up, one onto each tableau pile. If two or more of those cards have the same suit, move the lower-ranked ones onto the discard. When you can make no more moves, deal four more cards onto the tableaus, fanned down so that you can see the cards underneath. Only the topmost card of each tableau is available. Continue to move cards to the discard if they match the suit of any higher-ranked available card. If a pile is emptied, you must fill it with an available card from another tableau before you can deal again.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Michelangelo Pignani", "publishers": "Aackosoft", "genres": "Casino", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/116089-mr-chip-presents-pontoon-roulette-aces-high\n"}
