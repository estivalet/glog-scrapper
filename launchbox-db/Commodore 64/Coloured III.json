{"altername_name": [], "name": "Coloured III", "overview": "The final game in the \"Coloured\" trilogy of games, this is the most fully developed of the games. Colored II having the game start with a joystick would often trigger the code to stop the color movement and could make play very difficult. In this one he went back to using F1 to initiate the game and the space bar to trigger the stop. It retains the 3x3 grid, but with color that changes without the flashing effect. A new song was also made by Richard for the game.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Richard Bayliss", "publishers": "Binary Zone PD", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/114643-coloured-iii\n"}
