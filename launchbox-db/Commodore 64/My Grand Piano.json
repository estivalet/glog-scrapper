{"altername_name": [], "name": "My Grand Piano", "overview": "Play and sing the Fischer-Price way with this colorful and very grand piano. You're mom can't say that THIS is an outside toy! Now you can play over thirty different songs without reading a note of music! Just listen to a song. Then play each note along with the computer and listen as the computer plays it back to you. That's making music! When you get really good and can play all the tunes you've learned, you can even make up your own. Based on the popular Fisher-Price toy, My Grand Piano brings the enjoyment of music to young children of all ages. It's an easy and entertaining introduction to the theory of the piano and the classic songs of childhood - it's also a terrific way for the novice player to build confidence at the computer keyboard!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "GameTek", "publishers": "Fisher-Price", "genres": "Music", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/122244-my-grand-piano\n"}
