Based on your initial optional choice on the type of game you intend to play, you can adjust what you have to do and where you have to place that particular piece. The goal is to display on the screen of your computer the starting point and the ending point of the pipeline to be built. The presentation screen brings up the cursor on the left side from which the piece indicated in the center of the square located at the bottom left. Move the cursor to where you want to lay pipe. The score will depend on the length of the pipeline built.
