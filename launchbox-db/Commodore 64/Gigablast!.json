{"altername_name": ["Gigablast"], "name": "Gigablast!", "overview": "C64 Game Competition at SEUCK Game Creation Compo 2015 : Second Place winner. Published in Reset #07 Mix-i-Disk. You have been selected to test the GIGABLAST -- a devastating new superweapon. Fly the aircraft and drone across the robotic testing field, and take out as many machines as possible. You control the ship firing lasers, plus a drone which drops Gigablast plasma bombs. Your ship or your drone will be awarded an extra life for every 10,000 points scored. When you come across laser barriers, be careful! They can destroy your ship, but the drone will only be stopped by it. Whenever a green arrow appears on the ground, a hostile force-field will prevent normal flight. You have to pull your ship forward to break out of the field.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "January 3, 2015", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Alf Yngve", "publishers": "The New Dimension (TND)", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH576bSRkE0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/127659-gigablast\n"}
