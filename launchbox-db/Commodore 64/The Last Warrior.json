{"altername_name": ["Space Warrior (Caesar Software)"], "name": "The Last Warrior", "overview": "The Last Warrior is a space shooter is controlled from the cockpit of a scout ship - the last one in its squadron, following a particularly vicious alien attack; only a pair of frontal-mounted lasers and a finite amount of shield energy stand between the player and waves of relentless enemy fighters. As alien vessels zoom across the viewscreen, they must be hunted down using the lasers, before they get the chance to fight back. Every shot had better count, since firing uses up your precious shield energy. Enemy fire will deplete the shields as well; one hit without a shield, and you'll be sucking vacuum. When it's all over, your performance will be scored, along with a display of your hard-earned military rank.
