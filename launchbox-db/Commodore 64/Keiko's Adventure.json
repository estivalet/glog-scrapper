A Cute 'em' up (Shoot 'em' up) design for Kids but anyone can play it really, Very easy Game to Play, Shoot the baddies, collect the Balloons for bonus points and try to get a hi-score. Made with the Sideways Shoot 'Em' Up Construction Kit by Sensible Software and Jon Wells, Also Framework and Music by Richard Bayliss. Game did not work with framework v2 and v3 (Tile Map Corruption) , but worked with my Hacked up v1 and v2 mixed framework so i spent 3 Days hacking/removing/replacing code from V3, Fixed 1 problem and another would appear but now it is as stable as I can get it and Works fine for this Game.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "July 16, 2020", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "TheReaperUK", "publishers": "", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0D-VRrxOWw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/155372-keikos-adventure\n"}
