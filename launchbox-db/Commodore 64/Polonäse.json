{"altername_name": [], "name": "Polon\u00e4se", "overview": "An upgraded Worm/Snake style game published in Magic Disk 64 1994/05, Commodore Scene #21. The game is based on the classic \"Snake\", but only experts will recognize that straight away. You take on the role of the leader wolf, who asks the party guests to participate in the polonaise. All you have to do is touch them and it is only a matter of time before the line of people fills the entire hall. If for some reason the beginning of the snake touches the end or any middle part, the polonaise dissolves in a tumult and the game is over. In addition, you must not take your time, otherwise the party guests, who are already in a bad mood anyway, will leave bored.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Thomas Koncina", "publishers": "CP Verlag", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGf7Xodo1w", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/124250-polonase\n"}
