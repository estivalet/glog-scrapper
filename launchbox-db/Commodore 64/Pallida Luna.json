{"altername_name": ["Pale Moon"], "name": "Pallida Luna", "overview": "Pallida Luna is a 1985 Italian action game developed by Enrico Meloni and published by CESE s.r.l. as a part of Amico Bit # 3 It was re-released in English in 1987 under the name Pale Moon by Systems Editoriale s.r.l. as part of Commodore 64 Club #03 Simplistic but somewhat charming oldie where you're a demented tightrope-walker who has taken it upon himself to travel across the telephone wires connecting tall buildings in search of gold that gives you more time (didn't discover this until Round 6) whilst avoiding flying boots, snake-charmers, falling plant-pots, and electrical charges. If you fall, you scream and land up in the water below, much to the amusement of the alleycats nearby. I used save states to get me through it quicker as you go right back to screen 1 at each drop. You can continue on each Round after losing all three of your lives. Each Round has 6 screens. It seems to go on forever so I quit at Round 8. This game has a similar atmosphere to On The Tiles, with the twilight blue sky and lit windows of the buildings in the background.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Enrico Meloni", "publishers": "Centro Studi Editoriale", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79B_hiektH4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/123507-pallida-luna\n"}
