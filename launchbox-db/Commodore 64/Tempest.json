You need to defend yourself with a blaster that can fire nets or energy blasts. Nets trap the creatures and earn you double points, energy blasts kill them but sometimes only split them in which case you only get half points. if the screen turns yellow you must prepare to move your blaster as it moves up the screen to the top (A-la' Tempest), once successfully at the top, the game will resume in a new play area.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Clifford Ramshaw", "publishers": "E.
