{"altername_name": ["Boulder Dash Junior VIII: Scarab School Trip"], "name": "Boulder Dash Junior VIII", "overview": "The eighth game in the series by Andreas Kwias aka Holy Moses, the action puzzle was created in 2023. Subtitled Scarab School Trip. Another version of Boulder Dash Junior created by the Raiders of the Lost Empire group. Holy Moses from Raiders of the Lost Empire is practically responsible for the entire project. The music composer is Ghormak, and the author of Loader is Krill from the Plush group. I'm warning you! The game is programmed to troll or annoy the player. If you don't have nerves of steel, don't play this part. I'm afraid of the next installments of the series.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "April 6, 2023", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Raiders of the Lost Empire", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvhyPOJXUmo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/368035-boulder-dash-junior-viii\n"}
