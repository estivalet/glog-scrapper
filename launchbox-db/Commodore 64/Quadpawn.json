{"altername_name": [], "name": "Quadpawn", "overview": "A 1994 single player board game developed by David M. Moorman and published in Loadtsar #117. You'd think that a game of chess using only four pawns per side would be easy. Not necessarily so! Quadpawn is played on a 4x4 chessboard with four pawns for each side. The computer (Knees) will control the black pawns and you will control the white. Your goal is to get your white pawns to Knees' home row before Knees gets one of his black pawns to yours. Whoever does it first wins. If either player has no move then that player loses. Pawns move one square forward to an empty space or captures by moving one square diagonally. If you answer yes to allow Knees to remember his moves he will get more difficult as you play.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "David M.
