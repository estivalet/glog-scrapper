Ollie off of ramps, grind on rails, and swerve past pedestrians as you bust out tricks. Visit skate shops scattered around the park to upgrade your gear and improve your skills. Participate in competitions to earn medals and cash to use in the shops. But, if you don't get to a competition in time, the infamous \"Skate Or Die\" message appears, and then you have to hurry! There were two versions for the Commodore 64. One version was developed by Atari Games for the U.S./Canadian Market, and published by Mindscape, and the other version was developed by Tiertex for the European market and published by U.S. Gold in most of Europe, and by Erbe Software in Spain. This is the entry for the European version.
