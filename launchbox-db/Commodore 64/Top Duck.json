{"altername_name": [], "name": "Top Duck", "overview": "In this platform puzzler, your task is to guide our waddling wanderer round a series of platforms and ladders while avoiding the multitude of marauding meanies who are out to turn our courageous quacker into something hot that goes with noodles. Any contact at all will cost our feathered friend one of his meager three lives. To kill the baddies you must lure them under a platform and then peck one of the blocks above, which can fall on the baddies and crush their head. Squish, squish, squish! Blocks you peck become potential hazards later. Make your way to the mega dome and add a big fat nest egg of points to your totals.
