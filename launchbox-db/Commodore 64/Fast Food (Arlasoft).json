{"altername_name": [], "name": "Fast Food (Arlasoft)", "overview": "Not to be confused with the more well known C64 game of the same name by Codemasters, Fast Food is actually an unofficial conversion of the 1982 Atari 2600 game by Telesys. This conversion was developed by Arlasoft (Nick Sherman) and published on his itch.io page in 2021. How To Play: Simply move the mouth around the screen eating as much food as possible, while AVOIDING THE PURPLE PICKLES. If you eat six of these, it's game over. Some foods are worth more calories than others, and unlike the original the developer has added double scoring for items travelling at higher speeds to encourage some risk taking. After every 30 or so items eaten you will get fatter and the speed of the game will increase. Compatible with PAL and NTSC machines.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2021", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Arlasoft", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-Op3D6vHWA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/153228-fast-food-arlasoft\n"}
