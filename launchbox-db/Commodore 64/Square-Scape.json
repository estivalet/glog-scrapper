{"altername_name": ["Square Scape"], "name": "Square-Scape", "overview": "Square-Scape is a Brain\\Logic Puzzle game developed by Paul and Mark Kubiszyn and published under their own label (M&P Software) in 1994. Square-Scape is a totally new type of puzzle game, in which the sole aim is to reach the exit on each level. This would be an easy task, if you did not have a Move counter that allowed only a certain number of Moves in which to complete each level. You take control of the yellow and red striped square, using a joystick in port 2. You may Hove in any of the four directions, up, down, left, right, only if the adjacent square is free. At this point you lose one move. On most levels a token depicted by a 'T' is shown. By touching this, the exit will either appear or Move this may help or hinder your progress.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mark Kubiszyn", "publishers": "M&P Software", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg6vT6LCTrU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/130093-square-scape\n"}
