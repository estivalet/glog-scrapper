{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pixie Pete", "overview": "Deep, deep, down underground, Pixie Pete the pot-holer is digging for his life! Can you help him survive? You control this dauntless pixie, and must help him dig his own maze to escape from Desmond the Dragon. Dodge Desmond daringly for as long a duration as you dare, but if he comes in range: quickly engage your Hydrolic Ram Pump and begin pumping air into the dragon to blow him up. You must be quick and thorough to avoid losing a life. If you are able to destroy Desmond he will return to haunt you as Gorgo the Ghost. He can be destroyed the same way as Desmond but he doesn't need to stay in the tunnels. After eating all the carrots and destroying all the monsters you will move to a new challenge.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "January 1, 1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jason Perkins", "publishers": "Merlin Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP-9eUL0FPU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/32363-pixie-pete\n"}
