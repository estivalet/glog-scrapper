{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gamma Force in Pit of a Thousand Screams", "overview": "In a dangerous world, individual superheroes are not enough. Even the best of them - a humanoid made of flame, an elf princess with a mean bow, and a musclebound waterbeast - can't do it all themselves. When they come together, they are the Gamma Force. Can anybody stop them? A part of InfoComics, Gamma Force in Pit of a Thousand Screams follows the same gameplay template as the other members of this series. The gameplay basically consists of occasional decision-making, which interrupts viewing the comic book-like scenes of the game, advancing the story in different ways, depending on the player's choices. The player can also switch the points of view of the various characters, gaining more insight into the narrative.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tom Snyder Productions", "publishers": "Infocom", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSeLh2CsN0c", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/99239-gamma-force-in-pit-of-a-thousand-screams\n"}
