{"altername_name": [], "name": "Psykozone", "overview": "This great game by Alf Yngve was part of the original Psytronik Software line-up and was due to be released in 1994. Unfortunately the planned enhancements for the game did not happen and the game was not released - UNTIL NOW! Richard Bayliss has continued the project and has delivered this fantastic enhanced version of Psykozone! The game now features a separate intro sequence (complete with digi-tune by FeekZoid), brand new front-end and extra enhancements including 'get ready' and 'game over' sequences + a cool in-game tune by Matt Simmonds (a rendition of the classic theme from 'Streethawk'). Story: In the twenty first century the United States have collapsed into a myriad of independent regions. Some trade is being made between the regions by using a badly kept net of expressways known as the PSYKOZONE. These stretches of road are practically lawless, ruled by gangs of road warriors and genetically-enhanced psycho-bikers. The object of the game is to reach the Pacific ocean by travelling through the most dangerous part of the Psykozone. So load up with ammo, oil your engine, fill up your tank, secure the plutonium rods and brake for no-one!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2008", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Alf Yngve", "publishers": "Psytronik Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fviRgVhfF5Y", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/124453-psykozone\n"}
