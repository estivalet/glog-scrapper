{"altername_name": [], "name": "Harak Iri", "overview": "A German language text adventure with graphics for medium to low level challenge. Move in mystic labyrinths, search hidden caves, fight dragons and overcome the pernicious swamp beast and deadly mists in this fantasy adventure by Daniel Akik, released by Markt & Technik in 1990. Poor Harak's home village was invaded by the evil sorcerer Kart Offel. This evil sorcerer dwells, as befits a wizard, in a mage tower beyond the great mountains. Crossing it is the first obstacle the young hero faces. But even if this hurdle has been overcome, he unfortunately cannot compete with Kart Offel. The wizard is just too powerful. A snap of your fingers and Harak would be transformed into a toadstool... And why should Harak Iri put all the stress on himself? Simple, stupid Kart Offel stole his home computer! If that's not reason enough... So the warrior needs a little help, and there's really only one choice. Kart Offel's biggest enemy is his brother Pant Offel. If you find this, you might be able to put a stop to the magician's work.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Daniel Akik", "publishers": "Markt & Technik", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165460-harak-iri\n"}
