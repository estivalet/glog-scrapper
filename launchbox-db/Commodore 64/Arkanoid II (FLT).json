{"altername_name": ["Arkanoid II FLT", "Arkanoid 2", "Super Crack"], "name": "Arkanoid II (FLT)", "overview": "A full year before the official sequel to Arkanoid came out, Gollum of Fairlight, the brilliant Swede put out his spin on this Breakout variant where your paddle, known as a Vaus, forms a barrier with which you hurl the ball onto the blocks. If you lose a ball, the Vaus capsule will lose one of its 5 lives. Behind some blocks hide one of seven different extras. If the block is destroyed, an extra capsule sinks to the ground. If you catch it with the Vaus capsule, you will receive - next to points - an additional fitting, such as a wider bat, laser or slowing the ball down. Not to be confused with Arkanoid: Revenge of DOH, which came out a year or more later than this well known Homebrew version. This version was published widely in Italy under various names including Super Crack, Future Wall and Ball Out in publications from Sipe and Pubblirome/Edigamma.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "David A.
