{"altername_name": [], "name": "NARC", "overview": "Narc is a 1-2 player game, where your mission is to infiltrate the Mr. Big Corporation, the scourge of the underworld. To do this, you must get through the game's eight stages, with over ten sectors like the junkyard, subway, drug lab, nursery, downtown, Sunset Strip, and even the corporation, where Mr. Big resides. In order to get through the stages, you are required to collect a number of safe cards, and insert them in the slot next to the stage exit. Each sector includes a map, and should be easy to read. For example, the blue or red dots represent you, and the white dots are the missile launchers, while the \"E\" indicates the exit.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "December 31, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ocean Software", "publishers": "Ocean Software", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.52", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narc_%28video_game%29", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78N_PCc-sbU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6367-narc\n"}
