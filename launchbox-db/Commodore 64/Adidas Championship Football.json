To make a shot, the player needs to hold down the button for a certain amount of time (this determines the power of the shot) and only then play the ball. The angle can be changed by tapping the button.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nick Taylor, David Spicer & James O'Connor", "publishers": "Ocean Software Ltd.", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adidas_Championship_Football", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7kN7p-OT1I", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86673-adidas-championship-football\n"}
