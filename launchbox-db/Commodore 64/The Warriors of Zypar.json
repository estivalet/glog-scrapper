{"altername_name": ["Gli Sfidanti di Delta"], "name": "The Warriors of Zypar", "overview": "The inhabitants of the Delta planet, Zypar are a truly unique people and have a degree of civilization that is unmatched throughout the galaxy. Their laws require that at the age of 18 they must challenge their peers in a special gym to decide their future. The challenge takes place riding an inertial platform with which you have to undermine the opponent or direct him towards the door of death where the photonic rays will disintegrate. Once you have destroyed your opponent you will need to collect his remains to be able to increase your score. You can defend yourself from photonics by taking the energy blocks present in the central hole of the gym. The final winner will be allowed to join the legion of rulers while the loser will have to choose between exile or slavery to the rulers.
