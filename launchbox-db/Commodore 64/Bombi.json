{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bombi", "overview": "A Bomberman style game published in Poland as part of the \"Triada\" game pack. The game is basically for two players, but you can duel with the computer. This duel is about trying to eliminate the opponent with bombs. The game takes place in a maze built in half of indestructible and destructible parts. The latter disappear after blowing up their bomb and at the same time they can leave valuable items, such as increasing the number of bombs (at the beginning, we can only place one bomb - the next one can only be placed when it explodes: with an increased number of bombs, we can place more of them) , increasing the power of the fire, bombproof vest, etc. There are also other creatures on the screen that are very dangerous to come into contact with, so avoid them or eliminate them.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Piotr Wozniak", "publishers": "TimSoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FjMqYYZU-o", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/89804-bombi\n"}
