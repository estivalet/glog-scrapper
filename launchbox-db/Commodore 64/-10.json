{"altername_name": [], "name": ":10", "overview": "This is a game developed by Australian based coder Barry Hart (aka Cout) for the 2016 C64 4KB Game Coding Competition. It was coded entirely in BASIC. The goal of the game is to press beat the high score by pressing a key (any key) before the clock runs out. The closer you press the key to the count of zero (the clock fades and disappears before the count of four, thus adding to the challenge) In this game, the LOWER the number of the score, the better.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "October 2, 2016", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Barry Hart", "publishers": "Cout Games", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.27", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcmIaH-p1Ak", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/125334-10\n"}
