{"altername_name": ["Heliscan"], "name": "Xonox", "overview": "A Scramble style shooter by the mighty Zolt\u00e1n Ujhelyi & Birkas Mace. A new generation of Super Scramble! On the threshold of the twenty-second century, extra-planetary conflicts are now an everyday occurrence and the demand for good pilots has no limit. But to master the sophisticated attack aircraft resulting from the evolution of centuries of wars, more and more skilled pilots are needed, so the training required to become a skyfighter must be very hard and selective. After years of testing and training you have reached the final test: you will have to face the fearsome Red Route, where driving your helicopter will have you flying over the attack zone to destroy enemy missile bases and gas reserves to refuel your vehicle. The test is NOT a simulation and if you want to keep your position you will need to do well. Happy hunting!
