{"altername_name": ["Bollicine"], "name": "Trouble Bubble", "overview": "One or two simultaneous players can tackle this marble madness-esque platformer. In Dreams anything can happen, even colored bubbles, normally calm and harmless turning in to sticky globes that wander around swallowing poor Andrea's toys. Out of breath and sweaty, Andrea wakes up and discovers that it was just a bad dream. But this bad dream gave him an idea for the next one, which begins on his next rest! Now he is dreaming of a whole world of new toys, which he has never been able to have and it is he who guides the bubbles towards th toys to wrap them and bring them to him. But there is another bubble that appears and tries to steal the toys. This game can be especially fun if played by two friends at the same time, which whips the game to a frenzied pace. There is a small red square on the route which will randomly rearrange things to be recovered, adding to the fun.
