{"altername_name": [], "name": "Paddles", "overview": "Paddles is an arcade game for up to two players. The player should catch the ball when it comes towards his side. Catching the ball is rewarded with some amount of points, depending on ball speed. The bounced ball returns to the opponent's side. In the middle of the screen, it is a flashing bolt-figure, called an energy field. Every time the ball affects this, it will change its direction and speed, according to the shape of the field.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gerry Jo Jellestad", "publishers": "Patriot Games", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/123347-paddles\n"}
