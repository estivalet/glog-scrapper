{"altername_name": ["Kid Niki to the Rescue"], "name": "Kid Niki: Radical Ninja", "overview": "Kid Niki is armed with the Spinning Sword, which according to the game's manual, \"has been passed down from generation to generation from the School of Chirin.\" In addition to the spinning sword, Kid Niki can gain extra offensive power by collecting Bells. The Golden Bell allows him to launch a projectile every time Kid Niki spins his sword, and the Silver Bell creates a spinning force field around him. Both of these power-ups last for a limited amount of time. The game is divided up into seven rounds, with a boss character at the end of each one.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Quicksilver Software", "publishers": "Data East", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kid_Niki:_Radical_Ninja", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5TJ0GREYRI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/20379-kid-niki-radical-ninja\n"}
