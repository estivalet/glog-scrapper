{"altername_name": ["The Chrome Brothers"], "name": "Chrome Bros", "overview": "This cover-mounted cassette contains two full Hewson games - Stormlord and its sequel Deliverance, as well as 3 Shoot \u2018Em Up Construction Kit creations by a New Zealander. Chrome Bros is an unusual use of SEUCK; a platform game. Our heroes must climb ladders, collect bonus items and face various pre-programmed enemies (largely by avoiding them, as the player has limited ammunition). Levels are horizontally symmetrical, other than the locations of bonus items and the danger from daggers which move horizontally across the screen.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Martin Edwards", "publishers": "Future Publishing", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKzmqXJAgQw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90665-chrome-bros\n"}
