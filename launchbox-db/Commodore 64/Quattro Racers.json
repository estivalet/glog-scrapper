{"altername_name": [], "name": "Quattro Racers", "overview": "Quattro Racers belongs to Codemasters' Quattro compilation series. It includes the following four games: ATV Simulator: Viewed side on, and with a split screen 2-player option, this game simulated the then-new All Terrain Vehicles in an action-based way. The game features a succession of courses, which must be navigated in 30 seconds. You must run to the vehicle initially, and will also have to manually remount if you fall off - all costing you more precious time. BMX Simulator 2: Is a sequel to the game BMX Simulator. It still looks and plays like the first game but instead of two riders racing there are now four. Also instead of just one terrain there is now two, Dirt and Quarry. Dirt racing is still the same as the first game but Quarry racing is classed as expert and you can choose the thickness of your tyres and the chain wheel size. BMX Freestyle: Is a multi-event game where you and another player attempt six freestyle events on a BMX bike. Each event has a qualifying standard and must be completed before moving onto the next event. If all events have been completed then you repeat them with a higher qualifying standard. Jet Bike Simulator: Allows one or two players to race a jet ski against computer riders over a number of laps on various courses. There are three areas to race in: docks, lakes and coastline.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Codemasters", "publishers": "Codemasters", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109628-quattro-racers\n"}
