{"altername_name": [], "name": "Championship Dominoes", "overview": "Published in Commodore Disk User 1989/03-04 and in Your Commodore 1990/10 (Tape #09). The game uses a double six set of dominoes and takes out all the drudgery of shuffling and starting the game as the computer checks who holds the highest double, or the highest value, if no doubles are held by any of the three players, Player three is the human contestant, of course. To make the game as realistic as possible redefined characters are used to display the dots of the dominoes including colors. As screen area is limited, certain changes to the game layout had to be made but these were carefully considered so as not to detract from the pleasure of the game. Only the last domino played at either end of the line is displayed, however, as a domino is played the value of the domino is added to the appropriate column on the right of the screen. This allows a check to be kept of all the dominoes that have been played, helping you to decide on your move. The block at the left of the screen with a number in it indicates the number of dominoes left in the pool which can be drawn from if necessary.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Athol McEwan", "publishers": "Argus Specialist Publications", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90551-championship-dominoes\n"}
