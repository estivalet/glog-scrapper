{"altername_name": ["Squad I", "Squad One", "Squad1"], "name": "Squad1", "overview": "Squad1 (also known as Squad I and Squad One) was a game that was produced by a crew called Groovy Bits back in 1988, first heard about thanks to a magazine article in Datormagazinet Issue #4/1989 (Released in March) in Sweden which interviewed the team about a title called Vietnam Gunboat. The game was a Delta clone which was submitted to Players Software, and ultimately rejected due to too many clones of that sort on the market at the time. They instead offered them the Vietnam Gunboat to complete. The game was actually pretty much completed, and the guys at Fairlight found and released the game in May 2017. It is hoped that maybe something of Vietnam Gunboat may follow!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "The Savages", "publishers": "Unreleased Prototype", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzJVEu_QDBQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/144814-squad1\n"}
