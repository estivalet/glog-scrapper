{"altername_name": [], "name": "Abrakadabra", "overview": "Your magical, but clumsy apprentice got up to some nonsense and managed to shut up your entire castle and bewitched and summoned innumerable ghosts! They are making the walls unsafe, you must drive them away. Magic sticks are embedded in the walls, so you need to active them by pointing to the corresponding side of the wall with your magic wand and press the fire button if a ghost is leaning against the wall it will be transformed into stone. Unfortunately if other ghosts are active, they will eventually free themselves. If all ghosts in a room are frozen they will stay that way and you can move on to the next room.
