{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mega Molecules", "overview": "In this game by Paul Kubiszyn and published in Commodore Scene #15. You take control of a ship at the bottom of the screen. You control it, using a joystick in port 2. Pressing the fire button, will launch a bullet up the screen. The idea of each level is to rid the screen of menacing balls, or molecules. To do this you must hit each molecule a number of times, until finally it disappears. When the screen is empty, you will progress onto the next level. Some times you will encounter a token, which will disappear after only 1 hit. The effects of a token last until you lose a life, of which you have 3. After 5 levels, you will also encounter a mini-boss called Big Legs. This creature will take an increasing number of hits to kill.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Paul Kubiszyn", "publishers": "Commodore Scene", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDoowJJ7zK0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/166491-mega-molecules\n"}
