Help your froggy friend move around the pond by determining the direction and number of hops to make at each step as you work your way to the farthest lilly-pad. The challenge is tough. To win, you must unlock the secret of the pond and show your frog the safe path across. You need to find the pattern that will carry the frog safely through the maze of lily pads. To find the pattern, you'll want to scout ahead from lily pad to lily pad and then test your alternate routes. Beware of blind alleys. As the frog hops from pad to pad, the risks are high. One wrong move... and splash. the frog is in the water ... and you are back at the beginning. Six levels of difficulty make this colorful program a challenge for the whole family.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Eric Grubbs", "publishers": "Sunburst Communications Inc.", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/124252-the-pond\n"}
