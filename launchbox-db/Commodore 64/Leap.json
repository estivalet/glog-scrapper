{"altername_name": [], "name": "Leap", "overview": "Leap is a puzzle game where the player must clear all pegs from a grid. The grid is sized four by eight tiles and each tile is initially occupied by a peg. The player may select a first tile to remove, or have one removed at random. Each turn the player may let one peg jump over another peg in horizontal or diagonal direction. A peg which is jumped over is removed from the grid. The game ends when all pegs are removed or no more moves are possible. The Commodore PET version uses a coordinate system for controls; players type in the coordinate of the peg they want to move and where they want to move it to. The Commodore 64 version is controlled with the Joystick.
