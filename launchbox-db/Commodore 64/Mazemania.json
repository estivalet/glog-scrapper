{"altername_name": ["Supermaze", "Dedalo"], "name": "Mazemania", "overview": "Released as part of The Big 100 Collection, a collection of 100 Commodore 64, Amiga and DOS games. Released as Dedalo in Italy in both Hit Parade C64 n.58 (luglio/agosto 1991) and New Special PlayGames n.42 (maggio 1991). Solitaire games are always fascinating, especially when like our Daedalus they take you up to make you hold your breath. You are trapped inside a super maze whose path is obviously invisible. As you continue on your path the walls will be built alongside or in front of you and you will find that you are often trapped and will be forced to double back. The aim of the game is to reach the exit in as short a period of time as possible. Fighting against time and against yourself to overcome your personal best. You will have no chance of knowing your street or where your destination is unless you want to spend 10 seconds at a time to see the map. Of course flying blind will be more exciting.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Edizioni Societ\u00e0 SIPE", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75958-mazemania\n"}
