{"altername_name": [], "name": "Star Trek: Flucht ins Paradies", "overview": "A German Star Trek themed text and graphic adventure game, in English the title is Star Trek: Escape to Paradise. Starbase II really is one of the most awkward places in the galaxy. Not because of the food or the prices, rather the administration has suffered from a permanent shortage of staff since the galactic crisis of 2273. The administration came up with an ugly method to kidnap unsuspecting travelers who were in the orbit of Starbase II or its planet Regula IV and then use certain means to oblige them to do good service. No one has ever heard of a victim again. Your adventure on Starbase II begins as a \"person without a memory\". To escape, you first have to find a way to get to Starbase III. With a lot of luck and a good plan, you can then hijack an interstellar spaceship and escape the slavery.
