{"altername_name": [], "name": "Zillion", "overview": "Zillion is a video slot machine simulation developed by Helge Sascha Anders Kozielek and published by CP Verlag in Magic Disk 64 1993/12. If you are interested in gambling, but visits to various gambling caves become too expensive in the long run, you can have just as much fun with \"Zillion\" - but free of charge! \"Zillion\" is a simulation of a slot machine popularly known as the \"one armed bandit\". During a game run, the three reels each stop three times. If no three identical symbols have appeared on the reels, a credit is deducted and you slowly approach the end of the game. The rollers stop randomly or at the push of a joystick.If the reels are stopped for the first time, you can \"keep\" up to two symbols by selecting the \"Hold\" option. This considerably increases the chances of a hit. The game is over when all credits have been used or by simply selecting the \"Coin\" field.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Helge Sascha Anders Kozielek", "publishers": "CP Verlag", "genres": "Casino", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peYa4_Ah5Jk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138950-zillion\n"}
