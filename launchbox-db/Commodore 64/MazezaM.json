{"altername_name": [], "name": "MazezaM", "overview": "MazezaM is a puzzle game, where the player must guide his character through a mazealike room to the exit, by sliding the walls. The rules seems simple and easy to solve, but once the player passes the first levels, he finds himself in a much harder situations. The motivation to go on and see the next levels is still going on at the harder levels, making the game fun for long hours. Sometime it can take hours just to pass a single level. The puzzle game MazezaM for Commodore 64 was developed soon after the Apple II version of the game was finished. The Commodore 64 have a 6502 compatible processor, like the Apple 2, so the gamecode was not hard to translate. Unlike the Apple II, the C64 have graphic and sound coprocessors, which I utilized when transferring the game to Commodore machine. This took extra efforts, but finally at the beginning of year 2004, the game was ready for first public release. Only some hours after I published the C64 version of the game, cracked pirate version was uploaded to some C64 servers, with intro and trainer. Later, second crack by other group appeared. It proved to be quite popular among the C64 gamers, being reviewed in a magazine and web sites.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2004", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ventzislav Tzvetkov", "publishers": "GO64!", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/160607-mazezam\n"}
