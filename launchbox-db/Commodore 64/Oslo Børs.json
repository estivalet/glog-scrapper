{"altername_name": [], "name": "Oslo B\u00f8rs", "overview": "The Oslo Stock Exchange supports up to four players, and it definitely becomes more entertaining when playing against friends. However, the stock market is very limited and there are only six different stocks to choose from - plus gold then. You start with a sum of money, and then you go around the \"table\". Unpredictable, random events It is also not possible to choose which stock you want to trade directly, you get a request for a random share - and whether you want to buy or sell it. If you do not want to trade with the given stock, you can ask to trade with a new, random stock up to twice, but then the next man is his turn. This makes the game a bit more unpredictable, as you can risk getting stuck with shares that plummet, without getting sold before it's too late. During the game, stock dividends can be distributed to lucky shareholders. Other incidental events may also occur, which may contribute to stock prices jumping in the weather. However, one can lose big on other incidents, for example by revealing that a company has lousy management or lazy workers (!). King Course ... Companies can even go bankrupt, so you lose all your hard-invested funds. Often, warnings occur in advance, for example, stating that the company has lost big money lately - or that the share price is significantly lower than it was initially. In the event of a bankruptcy, a new company also appears in the same industry that you can trade with.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1980", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "L\u00f8renskog Knack", "publishers": "Folkedata", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eC9jBuMzWME", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/118375-oslo-bors\n"}
