{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cave Kooks", "overview": "Inspired by the arcade game Dig Dug, Cave Kooks is a single screen game viewed from the side where you have to dig through the dirt to remove creatures over various levels. The creatures in question are threatening to collapse the Earth's crust as they burrow to make their habitats and you must stop them. You must reach each of the creatures which vary in numbers the further you progress and shoot out a bar and when it hits a creature you can spin them to remove them. Some of the creatures fire at you while others move from one tunnel to another. On later levels more creatures appear on the surface and these have to be removed as well. if you touch any creature or it's bullets then you lose one of three lives and the level has to be started again.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mike Wacker", "publishers": "Mogul Communications", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLotcg2YXSE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90387-cave-kooks\n"}
