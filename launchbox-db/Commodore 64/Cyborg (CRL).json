Each level of the alien ship has rooms to explore and you must either avoid or destroy the aliens and robots. Computer terminals give you access codes to locked areas of the ship. The game screen has the top half showing your character and location scene while the bottom half has a read-out panel showing an analysis of items encountered and an options display with commands like: character analysis, scanner, examine, status, get, put, hold, and inventory.
