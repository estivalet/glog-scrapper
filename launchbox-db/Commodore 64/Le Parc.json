{"altername_name": [], "name": "Le Parc", "overview": "A puzzle game created by Michael Strelecki and published in 64'er Top-Spiele #3, 64'er 1999/02. FLI graphics are generally associated with great title graphics. Not so with our game LeParc: It only uses FLI graphics. When there is high motivation to play and motivating sounds thunder out of the speakers. You have a 96-block field in front of you, which you have to fill with 76 given symbol stones within a time limit. Seems easy, but it isn't. Of course, there is a simple rule to be observed: the stone to be placed must correspond in shape or color to the neighboring stones. You should therefore divide the field carefully. You can control the cursor (animated bar) with a joystick in port 2. You can walk across the free fields, but not over stones that have already been placed. In the small display on the right-hand side you can see (from top to bottom) the number of so-called Read off the memorial stones, the current and next stone to be placed, the number of remaining stones and the remaining time. At the top are points, total time, level and level area information. After a random number of moves, a question mark will appear somewhere on the board. You now have exactly three seconds to collect this symbol. If you don't succeed, there are two possibilities: Either the field is blocked or (if the question mark is surrounded by other stones) all surrounding stones disappear.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Michael Strelecki", "publishers": "Markt & Technik", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWmspQr9xbY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109442-le-parc\n"}
