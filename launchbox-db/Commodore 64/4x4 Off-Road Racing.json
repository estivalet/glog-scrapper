{"altername_name": [], "name": "4x4 Off-Road Racing", "overview": "In 4x4 Off-Road Racing you need logical reasoning and driving skills. Before you start you can choose between several cars, which vary by weight and power. There are many routes to choose from where the \"hard-core\" race is then carried out. Before it finally comes to the start, you have to choose from a pool of provided tools and extras for your car. E.g. your car can be equipped with a bigger tank, bigger tyres and a cable winch to get easier through the race. The tank allows you to fuel more gas, to make less stopovers. The \"A/T tyres\" help you, to get safely through the quicksand and the cable winch helps you with steep slopes. When you have retooled your car accordingly, you go on to the supermarket where you can buy things like fuel, oil, coolant, gear oil, spare battery, spare tyres, tools, mechanics, map, food&drinks and so on. But you have to be careful not to buy too much, as you have only limited space in your car.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Epyx", "publishers": "Epyx", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.15", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4x4_Off-Road_Racing", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RIHaZHCnlI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/74734-4x4-off-road-racing\n"}
