{"altername_name": [], "name": "Boing (E&J Software)", "overview": "You are Boris the Big Ball of Bollardia and you are attempting to escape from the Planet Phweeesh by bouncing over 120 zones to get to freedom. The game is a platform game with the screen scrolling constantly from left to right as you try to stay on the various platforms without falling into the water below. You can move Boris left or right but you can't control his bouncing so timing is required to stay on the platforms. As Boris bounces along he will encounter various creatures which require avoiding or shooting with his bullets or bombs but these are limited, but more can be collected along the way. If Boris falls in to the water or touches a creature then he loses one of four lives and when they are gone then it is game over.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Michael J.
