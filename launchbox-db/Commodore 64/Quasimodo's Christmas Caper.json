Warning! The Elves don't stay happy for long going about their business - if you take too long clearing the snowballs, they will magically turn on Quasimodo and become Naughty Little Elves looking to stop him with their snowball guns. And watch out! lurking in the wings is an evil snowman called Boris who will be out to try and thwart Quasimodo from completing his Christmas Caper.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "May 4, 2022", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "rwx designs", "publishers": "", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/170126-quasimodos-christmas-caper\n"}
