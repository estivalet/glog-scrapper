{"altername_name": [], "name": "Kentucky Derby (Ballantine Books)", "overview": "From the book \"Second Giant Book of Computer Games\". The top of the bill in most sports is a clash between the current champions. The two best football teams fight it out in the Super Bowl; the top two baseball teams play against each other in the World Series to see who really is the best; and in horse racing, the very best compete in the Kentucky Derby. Held on the first Saturday in May at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky, this event determines which of the best three-year-old thoroughbreds in the country will be awarded a permanent place in racing's hall of fame. With this program, you can experience some of the excitement of the Kentucky Derby without actually visiting Louisville. It's a program for two punters, or horseplayers, that actually lets you see your horse race across the screen. As you'll see when you run this program (by Philip Coates of Sunbury, on the outskirts of Melbourne, Australia), the odds remain constant for each race. The payout for picking a winner is, of course, related to the odds on the horse which you've decided to back, and to the amount you have actually bet on that horse.
