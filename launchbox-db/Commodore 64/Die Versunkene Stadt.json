{"altername_name": ["The Quest for Atlantis"], "name": "Die Versunkene Stadt", "overview": "An action game created by John Bettels and released in Input 64 1986/06. You are in a spaceship with limited energy and oxygen supplies and, after you have picked up at least seven diamonds, you are supposed to find the sunken city. So far so good. Of course, the author has built in some difficulties, but also the possibility to fill up on both energy and oxygen on the way, or simply to be transported from here to there. Keep fueled up and refill your oxygen supply by touching the flashing oxygen tanks. Some locks release themselves at certain intervals, while others have a door opener in front of and behind the lock. If you want to be transported to another section of the game without stress, you should (as always from above) drive onto the large box. If you're unlucky, you'll come out in the same place. If you have collected enough diamonds and nothing has fallen on your head along the way, you can remove the last barrier with the fire key (space bar) when you reach the city (it must be somewhere). The game ends when you drive towards a house. We wish you a steady hand (some passages are really narrow) and a lot of fun on the journey of discovery.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "June 2, 1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "John Bettels", "publishers": "Verlag Heinz Heise GmbH", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/134883-die-versunkene-stadt\n"}
