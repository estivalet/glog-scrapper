{"altername_name": ["Pulse"], "name": "Powertrak", "overview": "After the sudden passing of the giant comet Blazer 76 which hit Delos V with its poisonous gases, only a group of men in sector 98 had managed to survive, albeit with difficulty. The only way out would have been to reach the spaceport in the central sector, the only way to the station. But reluctantly, the men realized that the central beacon, which alone could coordinate the course along the tangled patch of the magnetic rails or Powertrack, had failed. It will therefore be necessary for a heroic volunteer on a manually-guided shuttle to try to solve the puzzle of the intricate connection network to reach the guideposts without damage and thus allow, after having repaired it, the escape of the precarious community of Sector 98.
