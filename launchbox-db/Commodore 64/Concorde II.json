{"altername_name": [], "name": "Concorde II", "overview": "Published in Your Commodore 1984/10. For many years the French and British airways have been discussing how to speed up travel an at last they have designed a new Concorde; Concorde II. This should be far better than the original Concorde as it travels much faster and is more economical to run. Being a test pilot yourself you have been given the chance to have the maiden flight. Your route is to Glasgow from Heathrow. The journey is not as easy as it seems as there are quite a few instruments to watch and the level you pick will have to depend on the weather conditions you will encounter. The flaps, undercarriage, speed, altitude, deviation readout and artificial horizon are all important instruments that you'll need to monitor. The game may sound easy to complete but wait until you are in the cockpit. There are levels you choose to increase the difficulty, storm, engine failure, strong winds, and many other conditions. Good luck, and happy landings!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "William Fong", "publishers": "Argus Specialist Publications", "genres": "Flight Simulator", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/91159-concorde-ii\n"}
