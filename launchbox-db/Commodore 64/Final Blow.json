{"altername_name": [], "name": "Final Blow", "overview": "Final Blow is a game based around the sport of boxing. You can play the fighters in a sequence of knock-out competitions, (the computer versions also include a round-robin league). Rounds last one minute, with a short break in between them. As in the real sport, your aim is to knock your opponent down for 10 seconds, by gradually weakening him with a series of punches. You can block punches, to avoid them inflicting damage onto you. The ring is of a limited size, so players can be cornered, although the referee will intervene to break the boxers up if they become entangled in a stalemate position.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "The Sales Curve", "publishers": "Storm", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCs08tgnHzo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/100892-final-blow\n"}
