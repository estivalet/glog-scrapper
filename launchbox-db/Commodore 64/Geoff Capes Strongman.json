{"altername_name": ["Geoff Capes Strongman Challenge"], "name": "Geoff Capes Strongman", "overview": "At a time when multi-event sports simulations were all the rage, this one was licensed by the successful shot-putter and strongman Geoff Capes. There are six events on offer, which represent standard strongman tasks such as truck-pulling, a tug of war and wrestling. Each must be completed within a time limit; points are awarded based on how much time is left. The game's control method and design philosophy distinguishes between each of the 8 main muscles Geoff uses. After a joystick-waggling challenge to raise as much strength as possible, you can choose which muscles to assign it to, which adds an element of strategy and memory-testing. During each event, the 8 muscles are displayed on either side of the screen, and as one comes into use it will flash. Controlling a cursor, you must click on this as quickly as possible to achieve maximum effect. Any energy unused on each muscle is kept over for future events.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Software Communications", "publishers": "Beau-Jolly", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "0.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nC9MRKwd3g", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/102040-geoff-capes-strongman\n"}
