{"altername_name": [], "name": "S.T.U.N. Runner", "overview": "It's 2492 and you must pilot your Sub-Terranean Underground Network (S.T.U.N.) craft at speeds over 900 miles per hour through a series of courses to retain your title as S.T.U.N. Runner, completing each course before time runs out. There are also enemies on each course, such as cycles, indestructible armored drones, and flying bird-like craft. Shoot or avoid them. If you hit them, you lose one of your shields (your craft has six total) and are slowed down temporarily. The more shields you have at the finish line, the more bonus points you get. Getting hit with no shields does not kill you, however. There are no lives in this game. The only way to lose is to fail to cross the finish line.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "The Kremlin", "publishers": "Domark Ltd.", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.33", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.T.U.N._Runner", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbDaSVcwF5w", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109989-stun-runner\n"}
