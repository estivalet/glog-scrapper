{"altername_name": ["Tunnel"], "name": "Cavern Construction Kit", "overview": "A horizontally scrolling cave shooter, much like Skramble. You control a ship armed with bombs and air-to-air missiles with the mission of penetrating enemy territory, inflicting as many losses as possible on your opponents and hoard up treasures. Some might call it a suicide mission because of the multitude of various enemies including missiles, lasers, radar stations and boulders, and you must keep an eye on fuel consumption and fill up the tank by bombing any tanks in your path. A very special feature of the game is the ability to modify the landscape and to add and remove enemies as desired to increase or lower the challenge level.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mike White", "publishers": "Edizioni Societ\u00e0 SIPE", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdYG27rumQ0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90398-cavern-construction-kit\n"}
