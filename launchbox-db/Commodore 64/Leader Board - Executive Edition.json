{"altername_name": ["Leaderboard Executive"], "name": "Leader Board: Executive Edition", "overview": "Leader Board: Executive Edition is a release in the Leader Board Golf series following up Leader Board and Leader Board Tournament. The control of your golfer is the same but this edition has a few graphical and gameplay changes. Bunkers and trees have been added and there is a choice of two courses which you can play with three other friends supporting from 18 to 72 holes of golf. Like the previous releases you have three skill levels, novice (club selection and power of shot), amateur (ability to hook or snap shot) or professional (wind affecting shots). Before your shot you can adjust where you want to hit the ball and you can select which club to use. To hit the ball you hold down the fire button and when the desired power is reached on the power bar you let go. When playing amateur or professional, you have to press the button again when the moving power bar moves into the middle of the snap bar to hit the ball straight. To putt you have to hold the fire button on a power bar and let go when you have reached the desired amount of power.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Access Software", "publishers": "Access Software", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.06", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2Ouy6Fj_CM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/29872-leader-board-executive-edition\n"}
