{"altername_name": [], "name": "Linking Leroy Visits LEGOLAND", "overview": "Linking Leroy Visits LEGOLAND is an unreleased video game for Commodore 64 developed by Fairlight. The game is a 2D platformer, with two levels, one based on Town and the other Classic Space. Work on the game started in 1991, and a preview was released in 1992 as part of Fairlight's \"LEGOLAND 2\" demo. The game came between scenes of the demo, linking them together, leading to the game's name. Fairlight's connections with LEGO were later broken, and while the game's developers initially planned on removing the LEGO graphics and finishing it, the project was eventually abandoned.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Magnus Nyman", "publishers": "", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=825ipI76Ubc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/121543-linking-leroy-visits-legoland\n"}
