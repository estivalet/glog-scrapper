{"altername_name": [], "name": "AquaVile", "overview": "AquaVile is an ocean-themed game in which the players control futuristic mini-submarine-like vessels and venture into a high-tech complex to destroy nefarious and hostile biological and technological abominations. It's a typical scrolling arcade shooter, slow-scrolling with plenty of enemies to shoot and fast-scrolling navigating around solid obstacles, moving in 8 directions and firing missiles at various opponents such as fish, crabs, octopi, urchins, starfish, little clams and big clams, robotic vessels, armed troopers and mines, as well as some bosses like a huge crab, a submarine and a giant ugly robot boss near the end of the game. This game was created in 3 days (including its soundtrack) using nothing but a NintendoDS and the Frodo emulator with SEUCK (Shoot 'Em Up Construction Kit) in November 2012.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2013", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Violator Entertainment", "publishers": "Commodore Free", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpF6fEqiVI4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75479-aquavile\n"}
