{"altername_name": [], "name": "Save Me, Brave Knight", "overview": "Save Me, Brave Knight can perhaps be considered a very early precursor of modern graphic role-playing games. The player is a medieval knight who must rescue a fair maiden from an evil castle, guarded by a sentient lock, flying witches and evil birds, and a fire-breathing dragon (yes, this is one dragon, albeit a seven-headed one, common in Hungarian children's tales.) After conquering all the obstacles, the knight must face a random choice between two doors, only one of which hides the maiden.
