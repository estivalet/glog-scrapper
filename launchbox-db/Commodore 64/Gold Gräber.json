{"altername_name": ["Goldgr\u00e4ber", "Goldgraeber"], "name": "Gold Gr\u00e4ber", "overview": "Avoid the ghosts and collect up the shiny gold. Gold is dug for on the playing field next to the main road, which then has to be brought to the site. The game begins after a 6 is rolled. The computer takes over the rolling of the dice for the whole game. Before proceeding, you have to buy something in field A: food by entering a number from 1-9. Note: the higher the number, the greater the food and thus longer endurance on the long trail - but also slower progress. Because you also have to look for gold and pick it up. The additional equipment with tool is entered by entering a 0 or 1 = yes or no. Note: without this equipment, interruptions on the road cannot be overcome. You can dig for gold on both sides of the pathThe player's progress is determined by rolling the randomly generated dice. When digging, the player finds gold or a chest, also with gold or with an event (poisonous snake, robber). Collected gold pieces are credited to the points account. These finds are only certain in the bank (on field B). This field can only be reached directly for redemption, otherwise it will be returned. Breaks on the road can only be overcome with the additional equipment. The game ends when players are \"starved\" or have been dug everywhere. The game is played with a joystick and release button. Hints: The more a player carries (gold, provisions, equipment), the slower he progresses. If two players reach the opposing field directly, they are caught and you get your gold. You can be walk in both directions.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jan Lindenberg", "publishers": "Europa Computer-Club", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/110329-gold-graber\n"}
