{"altername_name": [], "name": "Prisonball", "overview": "Prisonball is a two-player action game that combines the best elements from two classic computer games, Pong and Breakout. The object of the game is simple \u2014 knock out as many bricks as you can in the allotted time. The game begins by displaying five colored walls running vertically down the center of the screen. Each player controls two paddles located at the left and right sides of the screen. Three balls appear at a random location and start bouncing around the screen. When a ball is on your side of the screen, move one of your paddles into its path to deflect the ball toward the walls. If you happen to miss a ball, it wraps around the screen and appears on the other side, giving your opponent a chance to score. At the beginning of the game, all three balls are a neutral color. Each time you hit a ball, it changes to the color of your paddle. You score whenever a ball of your color hits one of the five interior walls.
