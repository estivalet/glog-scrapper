{"altername_name": ["Super Pipeline 2", "Pipeline 2"], "name": "Super Pipeline II", "overview": "The follow-up to Super Pipeline adds new enemies and 16 levels. The player controlled the (white-suited) foreman in charge of keeping the pipeline flowing to fill a number of barrels (which increased on later levels, up to 3). Two types of enemy run onto the pipe - those that can make a hole (commonly drills, a blowtorch and the earthenware jug) and pests (spiders, lobsters and so on). Once a hole is made in the pipe, the foreman must guide a (green-suited) workman to the hole, so it can be repaired. While the workman is mending the leak, he is vulnerable to being knocked off the pipe. The foreman is equipped with a gun to shoot enemies, but he can also be knocked off the pipe by the monsters. To make matters more complicated, the lobster can only be attacked from behind (due to its shell) and the \"Shower of Tacks\" on later levels cannot be shot at all.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Taskset", "publishers": "Mastertronic", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.36", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCiDwBzIKCU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/63116-super-pipeline-ii\n"}
