{"altername_name": ["Mangia Meteore"], "name": "Galactic Muncher", "overview": "A dodge'em style game blended with a catch'em game. Nicely implemented but not much happening with the gameplay. Simply move the muncher left and right to dodge things. When the dial on the left reaches the top you enter the next level. When the dial on the right reaches the bottom you die. Push the buttom to move the gaping mouth to eat the foes. In 2-player mode one player controls the muncher, the other the mouth. Published as Mangia Meteore in Italy's Super C64 e C128 n.3 (luglio/agosto 1986).", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Eberhard Aust", "publishers": "Data Media", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMRRM6iE_2c", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/101908-galactic-muncher\n"}
