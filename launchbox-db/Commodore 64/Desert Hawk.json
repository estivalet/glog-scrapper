{"altername_name": [], "name": "Desert Hawk", "overview": "Desert Hawk is a 2D-side-scroller shoot-em-up similar to Choplifter!- The player's mission is to fly a military helicopter behind enemy lines. Search for comrades and rescue them by landing close to them to pick them up. Three can be collected at a time, and must be returned to your base. The helicopter can only be landed on safe ground; it's onboard computer will tell you when this can be done. Enemy tanks and aircraft shoot permanently at you, with heat-seeking missiles especially dangerous. You are limited to 100 missiles and limited fuel on each level.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Michael Barnard", "publishers": "Players Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfUGqj1Ngpo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/96427-desert-hawk\n"}
