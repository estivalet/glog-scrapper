{"altername_name": [], "name": "Vortex Crystals", "overview": "It is the future. Scientists have discovered a form of energy crystals on the planet Vektor. These crystals might be able to protect the world from alien invasion. The Vektor crystals have been gathered and transported safely to Earth. But one of the scientists on board the transport ship was unexpectedly bitten by an alien \u2013 and he himself then mutated into a humanoid alien. On Earth, a huge complex of 16 floors was built to store the crystals. They were protected by security forces. Later, an alien mothership appeared above this Vortex Complex and a slimy green alien took over the security system. Aliens then beamed into each chamber to guard the crystals... So that an invasion can take place. The Prime Minister, Ed Master, has called for your help. You don a protective black suit, and arm yourself with a powerful laser. You grab a swipe card and enter the building. You realize that the building is not how it was before \u2013 considering that it is now infested with aliens. Trigger happy, you are happy for action and have an appetite of destruction at last!
