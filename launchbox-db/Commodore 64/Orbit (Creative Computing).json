{"altername_name": [], "name": "Orbit (Creative Computing)", "overview": "Published in \"BASIC Computer Games - Microcomputer Edition\". Orbit challenges you to visualize spatial positions in polar coordinates. The object is to detonate a Photon explosive within a certain distance of a germ laden Romulan spaceship. This ship is orbiting a planet at a constant altitude and orbital rate (degrees/hour). The location of the ship is hidden by a cloaking device, but after each bomb you can determine how close to the enemy ship it exploded. The challenge is to hit an invisible moving target with a limited number of shots.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1978", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jeff Lederer", "publishers": "Creative Computing Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/123227-orbit-creative-computing\n"}
