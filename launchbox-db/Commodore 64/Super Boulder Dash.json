{"altername_name": [], "name": "Super Boulder Dash", "overview": "Super Boulder Dash is a compilation including the original Boulder Dash and it's sequel, Boulder Dash II. In each of these games you control Rockford on a quest to recover diamonds from numerous caves. The caves contain numerous (falling) boulders, walls, and assorted creatures that all get in your way! Each game contains both an action and strategy element; you'll need to run fast to avoid creatures and falling boulders, but also need to carefully plot your course through the cave to avoid becoming trapped. When you have collected enough diamonds on the current level, you can make your way to the exit for the next, more difficult round. To make the games more challenging, each level has a time limit for completion.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Peter Liepa", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/3bh4yGtPut8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/85700-super-boulder-dash\n"}
