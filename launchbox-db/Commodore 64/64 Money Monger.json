{"altername_name": [], "name": "64 Money Monger", "overview": "This simple collect-em-up game was published in RUN 1988/08 (Issue #56). Mazes are randomly generated every time you play. You begin with 25 pieces of gold, you work you way through the maze, collecting gold pieces as you go. If you reach a dead end, you cannot retrace or backtrack. You can, however, press the space bar to blast your way through but each blast will cost you 3 gold pieces. If you consistently score above 65% you are a money monger, indeed!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nickey MacDonald", "publishers": "RUN", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.92", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86561-64-money-monger\n"}
