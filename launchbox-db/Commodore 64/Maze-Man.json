{"altername_name": [], "name": "Maze-Man", "overview": "A Pac-Man style collect-em-up game released as part of Magic Disk 64 1990/01. Surely you remember that voracious little yellow guy who hunted for points in a maze and was chased by evil spirits who wanted to take him down. PAC MAN, the name of this computer hero, laid the foundation stone for his career eight years ago, which has made him world famous to this day. A version of this classic with the title MAZE MAN can be found on this issue of MAGIC DISK. The aim of MAZE MAN is to collect all points that are on the playing field. The ghosts, the number of which increase from level to level, try to prevent them from doing so. As soon as the MAZE MAN has eaten up a point, an impenetrable wall is created on one of the four sides. The labyrinth is created gradually and is not visible from the start. But now it can easily happen that the MAZE MAN walled up a few points in the heat of the moment. In such a case, a black wall can be broken with a grenade (the MAZE MAN has a total of three grenades that are ignited by pressing the fire button) and the little computer hero can collect the points behind.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Frederic Thiesse", "publishers": "CP Verlag", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjO_xbTzWVI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75957-maze-man\n"}
