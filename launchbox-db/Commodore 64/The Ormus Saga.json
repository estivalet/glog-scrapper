{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Ormus Saga", "overview": "A 2D Adventure RPG published in Golden Disk 64 1993/01. The game is set in 1227 in the land of Beryland. The Ormus Cult has taken over the realm, and the PC has decided to do something about it. Character creation is just a name, at which point the player starts on \"the southwest shores of Beryland,\" next to a city called Remfield. In addition to running around the land as a typical RPG character, you can hire troops and equip them. Troops are alternatives to regular combat--you can send them to fight wandering orcs and snakes and such--but they're mandatory for combats in which you try to seize or defend a city. Occasionally, as you explore, you come across a city that's \"++OCCUPIED++\" by the Ormus Cult, and to get in and take advantage of its services, you need to take the city.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mike Doran", "publishers": "Mike Doran Software", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "0.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/123240-the-ormus-saga\n"}
