{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Alien Team", "overview": "Part of the Gamma Strike Game Pack, which includes a target system. The target system was only used for the final boss stage, the rest is a relatively standard side scrolling shoot'em up. When you get to the boss stage of the game the user would switch to the Gamma Strike light phaser device and hitting closer to the bullseye takes out the main boss more quickly. Can you penetrate the defences and outshoot all members of the elusive alien team?", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Simon Phillips & Stephen Kay", "publishers": "Gamesware", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.07", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLRQF28BH30", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/87041-the-alien-team\n"}
