{"altername_name": [], "name": "Alphabetica", "overview": "A puzzle game created by Tim Hartnell & Brett Hale and published in 1984 in the book \"The Big Fat Book of Commodore 64 Games\". This is a two-part game. The first part is very simple, but the speed with which you solve the easy problem (to work out which letter of the alphabet the computer is thinking of) dictates how many moves you'll have to work out the solution to the second part. The second is a game somewhat like Invicta's Mastermind, except that instead of you having to guess a code of colors, the code here is made up from the first six letters of the alphabet. The code could be ABeD, FDEA or even FFFF, or any other of the enormous number of possible combinations of those six letters. After-you've entered your guess, the computer will rate your answer. A plus sign (+) is awarded for each Letter which occurs in your code and in the computer's code, but not in the right position. So if the computer was thinking of ABCA and you entered CEEF, you would be awarded on a + sign. A correct Letter in the correct position gains you an asterisk (*). So, if you had entered AEEF when the computer was thinking of ABCA, you would be awarded an * as a result.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Brett Hale", "publishers": "Interface Publications", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/142271-alphabetica\n"}
