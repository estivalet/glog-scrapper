In the first case, these are homing missiles and in the second, ultra-modern missiles that follow heat sources. Both will be very useful to you in fights, but know right now that you only have 5 of each type available. You must be able to thwart all the combined attacks of enemy tanks and fighters that you will encounter, destroying them and preventing them from eliminating your base. If you succeed, you can rightfully claim to be a real fighter pilot!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Chris Yates", "publishers": "Edizioni Societ\u00e0 SIPE", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60PUU6Zk_hA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/128642-f-104\n"}
