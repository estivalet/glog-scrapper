{"altername_name": [], "name": "Balloon Crazy (1992)", "overview": "Balloon Crazy is a game designed by Ligia Latino for the Commodore 64 in 1992. It was published in COMPUTE!'s Gazette 1992/02-03. This is a game released in 1992, there is a game of the same name which was released in 1985, both from Compute! That game sort of borrowed elements of the arcade game Kickman. This one also borrows a lot from another arcade game, Anteater. The main difference is that instead of an anteater, you play a circus clown who needs to bust balloons with a hose that has a needle on it. However, in your way are monsters and magnets, and you have to avoid them as much as possible. Another difference is that in Anteater, your character is on top of the screen, while in this game, your character is at the bottom.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ligia Latino", "publishers": "COMPUTE!
