{"altername_name": [], "name": "Q10 Tankbuster", "overview": "You are a pilot of a Q10 Tankbuster and you have been sent to various war zones to destroy enemy aircraft, vehicles and other objects important to their cause. You are armed with a front firing gun as well as the ability to drop bombs. As you destroy the enemy, occasionally a blue helicopter will fly towards you and when shot it will leave behind a icon which increases your firepower, gives a shield, or an extra life. Getting hit by bullets or an enemies vehicle or aircraft loses a life. When all lives are lost then it is game over. At the end of each level is a huge end of level vehicle which needs destroying to progress to the next level. Q10 Tankbuster is a side view horizontal shooter where the screen scrolls from left to right constantly and you use a joystick or keyboard to control your plane.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "David Sowerby", "publishers": "Zeppelin Games", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6FNzXIPJLU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40966-q10-tankbuster\n"}
