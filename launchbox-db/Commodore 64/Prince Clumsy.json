{"altername_name": ["The Sword and the Rose"], "name": "Prince Clumsy", "overview": "The objective is to locate keys scattered across the various screens. Each key can open a portcullis that grants access to further screens. The ultimate goal is to rescue the (very tiny) princess from a prison cell in the castle. You can collect different weapons along the way, as well as food to restore health. There are also items that can slow you down, root you to the spot or poison you, so take care what you eat and drink! The game is very short, but it's nicely made with some decent graphics and a nice title tune by Allister Brimble.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Robert Toone", "publishers": "Cartoon Time", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3mZaaIw7G8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109255-prince-clumsy\n"}
