{"altername_name": ["Enforcer"], "name": "Enforcer: Fullmetal Megablaster", "overview": "Enforcer: Fullmetal Megablaster is a typical side-scrolling shooter. Maneuver your ship through several stages and destroy or dodge everything that gets in your way. Since the game is very fast and the number of enemies simultaneously on screen very high, your ship is not destroyed by a single collision, but has an energy bar. Shooting certain objects reveals different items and power-ups. These include: a spreadshot ,a laser, a secondary weapon that fires reflecting laser beams in four directions, smart bombs, health power-ups, shields and options. Options circle around your ship to offer protection and additional fire-power. Smart bombs damage or destroy everything on screen, while holding down the fire button will charge an especially powerful shot. At the end of each stage, the obligatory boss-battle awaits the player.
