{"altername_name": [], "name": "Double Dare (GameTek)", "overview": "Double Dare is the computer version of the game show originally hosted by Marc Summers. Like the TV show, the game is basically a trivia game with the added enhancement of being able to answer the question, or take a dare. Dares consist of the Toss-up Challenge, the Physical Challenge, and in the last round, the Obstacle Course. Questions are varied, and in large enough number to avoid excessive repetition even over several games worth of play.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "GameTek", "publishers": "GameTek", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/89109-double-dare-gametek\n"}
