{"altername_name": [], "name": "Penny Postie", "overview": "Penny and Peter are package-delivering posties. Their time is very limited, so they have to be quick and efficient! they can shovel snow out of their way, but this takes time. Using already cleaned paths is much faster. Control the player with the joystick in port 2. Shoveling is automatic when you move over snow, press fire to shovel to the right side. Press fire at a door to ring the bell and deliver the package. In two-player mode, Penny (joystick 1) competes with Peter (joystick 2). Whoever finishes their deliveries first wins the round. Tip to win: let the other one do the shoveling and focus on your deliveries.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "January 15, 2023", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Vintage Computing Carinthia", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbJDlBWwdhc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/169119-penny-postie\n"}
