{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Final Encounter", "overview": "Hungarian shoot em up game that has a stunning soundtrack but crippled by nigh-impossible attack waves. It seems your awesome chopper is piloted by a spitting monkey! However, your weapon improves - slightly - on Level Three, but you still have about 10% probability of dodging or shooting anything. Infinite lives used, for sure! I warped through some of it as it just got pointless and was about to stop recording at the high-score part, only to find that there's an end screen after it, and a real nice one at that.
