In this game you can imagine that you need to reconstruct a Mastermind game after dropping some pegs off the board. Envision a game of Mastermind where you are ready to put in the final row of pegs that you KNOW are correct, then some pegs are spilled\\removed and unable to be retrieved. So you must reconstruct the pieces using logic alone! F1 cycles between background colors. F7 gives you a hint. Q will quit. All puzzles should be solvable only a single way.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dave Johannsen", "publishers": "Softdisk Publishing", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/99881-expertmind\n"}
