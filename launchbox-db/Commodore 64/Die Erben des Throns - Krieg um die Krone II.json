{"altername_name": [], "name": "Die Erben des Throns: Krieg um die Krone II", "overview": "War for the Crown is a strategy game by the German Design Group , which appeared in 1989 for the C64 . It's a bit like the board game Risk. The goal is to conquer a fantasy kingdom or ascend to the king. To do this you must conquer lands in which there are chests. In the chests sovereign insignia (crown, scepter, imperial apples) are included. Each baron has its own insignia. Whoever has all three first is crowned king. In addition to competing barons, there is also a threat of trolls and dragons. The game has a certain similarity to risk. The kingdom is divided into individual areas that are either unoccupied or occupied by an army (trolls or people). Once per turn, each baron first receives reinforcements, which are distributed to all controlled (= occupied with their own troops) fields, then optionally an area that borders on their own areas are attacked. In this case, all but one of each adjacent, controlled field can be sent to battle. However, unlike risk, terrain also affects the outcome of the fight. The kingdom is regenerated for each game. The game can be played with up to 4 players.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Stefan Knappmann", "publishers": "German Design Group (GDG)", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/116825-die-erben-des-throns-krieg-um-die-krone-ii\n"}
