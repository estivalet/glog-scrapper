This game has participated in Retro Programmers Inside's Racing Cars game jam, to be streamed in late February by Prince/Phaze101 via Twitch & YouTube. It was programmed in Kick Assembler V5.25, with aid of CBMPRGStudio V4.0. For Speed We Need 3 is a fun hi score challenge game. You have entered the RB Le Mans challenge. Your task is to complete and also survive all 24 laps. This may sound pretty much simple, but there are enemy cars charging towards you from the front. The opponents will not stop for anyone either! You score points by travelling distances. Also, if you complete a lap, you will be awarded a bonus of 1,000 points, plus an extra life. Time, low fuel and damage to your car are your enemies and you only have a few lives.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "March 31, 2023", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Starhawk", "publishers": "The New Dimension", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/367742-for-speed-we-need-3\n"}
