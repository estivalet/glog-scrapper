{"altername_name": [], "name": "Speedball", "overview": "The game is played by two teams on an enclosed court with a goal at each end, similar to that of ice hockey or five-a-side football. The court contains elements that affect gameplay, such as score multipliers and power ups. Points are scored by successfully getting the ball into the goal, and also by injuring opposition players. The team that has amassed the most points at the end of the game is the winner. A player has control of only one outfield player on a team at any one time. The game may be played by one or two players; two player games are played competitively.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "The Bitmap Brothers", "publishers": "Image Works", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.49", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedball_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRaNOUKFPQw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6151-speedball\n"}
