{"altername_name": [], "name": "Flock", "overview": "Flock is a clone of Satan\u2019s Hollow, and borrows graphics from the original game and various sprites, music and routines from other titles. The result is an original game though where you must shoot down flocks of birds. Francesco built the game in assembly, possibly with some in compiled BASIC. It\u2019s a simple but fun shooter which was typical of the games found on the Italian compilation tapes that were so popular.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Francesco Milioni", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165278-flock\n"}
