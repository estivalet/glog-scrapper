{"altername_name": [], "name": "Magus", "overview": "This game is interesting in a way, but suffers from much wordiness, which appears to be irrelevant (at least to Part 1). You are never really clear on the objective. Hints are given in poetry form. You often need to cast spells which you can do if you have the page placed in the book. Hence the first priority is to find in book into which you can put the spells. Some of the hints are very obscure, or are typographical errors, for example, the word \"spell\" appears to mean to rearrange letters, though \"nopw\", which seems to means \"open\" may be a mistake. There seem to be at least 13 pages, only which a few can be located in part 1, some of which are usable in this part, others not; some of which may refer to the same thing but in a different way. Others do not appear to be available in this part. TAKE PAGE will put it in the book; PAGE # allows you to read the page. The game comes in four parts/acts", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "de-Leuw", "publishers": "D.N.D.
