{"altername_name": [], "name": "Digger (Compute! Publications)", "overview": "COMPUTE!'s Gazette 1985/03 (Issue #21), and in Super VIC & C64 A2-N08 (September 1985). This game may not be the Greatest of all Time, but it does contain a bunch of GOATs! The object of Digger is to avoid three billy goats who are gruffly pursuing you through underground terrain. You can make the goats vanish by digging the soil from under any of 3 rocks in time to fall on the heads of as many goats are in the way. You can also immobilize them momentarily by inflating them with your trusty air pump. (Hold on, this is starting to sound familiar.) Remember you cannot disengage until you've hit F7 long enough to fully inflate the nanny. Meanwhile, other goats continue to hunt you down.
