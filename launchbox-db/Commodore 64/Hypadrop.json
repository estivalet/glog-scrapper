{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hypadrop", "overview": "The ball you control is bouncing back and forth over a small platform with a drop on both sides. You must time your fire button activation that will send the horizontally bouncing ball straight down vertically at the exact moment you push the button. If it hits the platform you can keep playing, if it misses on either side the game is over. It is just that simple!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1997", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Richard Bayliss", "publishers": "The New Dimension (TND)", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/105940-hypadrop\n"}
