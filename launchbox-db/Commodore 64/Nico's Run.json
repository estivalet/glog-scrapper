{"altername_name": [], "name": "Nico's Run", "overview": "Its an endless runner game themed around my two Dogs \"Nico\" and \"Aston\", Nico was not well at the time this Game Jam was running, and my viewers and I did not want to replicate the game, we wanted to use the essence of the game and create a new game, so its about Nico trying to run away from his brother Aston, as Aston would not leave him alone while he was unwell. In the game you jump over trees, kennels and stumps, collect bones, shields and cookies. Avoid UFOs and Aston.
