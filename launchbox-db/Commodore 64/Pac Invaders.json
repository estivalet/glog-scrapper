{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pac Invaders", "overview": "A homebrew Space Invaders style shoot'em up by Reed Byers aka Unbeliever. Released with source with excellent comments if you are interested in learning some assembly language. It's basically just a shooting gallery, nothing special. One row of targets that simply moves back and forth til you shoot them all, then they start a row closer, and faster. After five rows of the same enemy, you start a new \"wave\" of five rows, with a new enemy. After four waves, you start back with the first wave. Your only score is your hit/miss ratio, and your enemies can't shoot back. If you want to take a break, just walk away from the game; the enemies will be happy to wander back and forth until you're ready to shoot them some more. Every single sprite is animated; even your shot. Every enemy type has its own explosion shape. There are simple sound effects for shooting, and explosions.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2021", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Reed Byers", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGfUwPEeZeE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/166390-pac-invaders\n"}
