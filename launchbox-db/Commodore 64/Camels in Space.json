{"altername_name": [], "name": "Camels in Space", "overview": "A sort of tribute to Llamasoft games. Well, you might have guessed, this game involves Sheep. Erm, sorry, but no. I really meant Camels. You are a pink camel (Pink? What the heck? Pink?) who has landed on a strange planet. Unfortunately for your camel, it doesn't really want to stay on that hostile planet and wants to escape. Unfortunately to be able to escape you must defeat ALL 8 alien attack waves, simply by firing pulses out of your laser powered eyes. Don't let your camel get hit too many times, else it will die. This game has a sort of surprising end sequence to it as well.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2001", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Richard Bayliss", "publishers": "The New Dimension (TND)", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgbxShPzzQg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75422-camels-in-space\n"}
