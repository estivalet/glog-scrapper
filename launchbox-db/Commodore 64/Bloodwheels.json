{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bloodwheels", "overview": "Released as a sample of \"Shoot Em Up Destruction Set 2\", BLOODWHEELS was originally going to be released on the Psytronik label back in 1994 but has instead lain dormant in the Alf Yngve archives - UNTIL NOW! Now at long last the game has been unleashed on the C64 with brand-new enhancements! In this game you control an armoured vehicle on a mission that takes you through an arid desert-scape, a war-torn town, over bridges, through an army base, through dense jungle and an evacuated city etc. The game features some nicely detailed sprites, destructible scenery and can be played by one or two players. War has never been so much fun!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2011", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Alf Yngve", "publishers": "Psytronik Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf933Y2WRN4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/101497-bloodwheels\n"}
