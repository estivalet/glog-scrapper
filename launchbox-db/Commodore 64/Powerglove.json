{"altername_name": [], "name": "Powerglove", "overview": "Published as part of the RGCD C64 16KB Cartridge Game Development Competition 2013. The world's fossil resources are exhausted. Two polar subterranean thermal reactors supply the increasing energy demand of mankind. An explosion in the Northern polar thermal reactor has destroyed all primary and secondary energy connections and contact with the engineers and rescue robots has been lost. Without an energy supply the death of billions is imminent! We need the five control diamonds to engage the station's backup systems. Use the shielded suit and the Powerglove to protect you against the maintenance robots. Powerglove is a classic-era run 'n' gun game developed by Lazycow for the 30 year old Commodore 64 home computer, initially released as an entry in the RGCD 2013 RGCD 16K C64 Game Development Competition (where it placed 3rd out of 15 entries). This final version features a revised five level map with Powerboots and Energy Doors, faster room-change, slicker player controls, a map overview display, bug fixes, game balance tweaks and a much-requested shot sound effect! Powerglove has full NTSC support, and the game and music run at the same speed as on PAL systems.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2014", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Matthias Bock", "publishers": "RGCD", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq8bTFpRMYc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/124307-powerglove\n"}
