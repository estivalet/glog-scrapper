{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bite of the Sorority Vampires", "overview": "This bundle gathers together three genre-influenced adult text-adventure games: Bite of the Sorority Vampires, a chilling tale of a sororal campus organization, Eta Beta Pi, whose insatiable members may be responsible for the disappearance of your friend -- as a member of the school newspaper, it's your duty to bust this creepy tale wide! (And as a man, you have other duties...); Hatchet Honeymoon, a weird vignette of a newlywed rescuing his fresh and virginal bride from the foul clutches of a shadowy stranger in a haunted mansion filled with secret passages (and amorous cleaning staff); Sex Vixens From Space, pulp sci-fi hero Brad Stallion's first foray -- saving the universe from astro-Amazons armed with emasculating sex-ray guns ... using some of his own specialised equipment (later expanded upon elsewhere in more lush graphic depictions that really allowed the subject matter to come to vivid life!)
