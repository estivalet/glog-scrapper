Nothing has changed substantially: the gameplay and the graphics are identical to Phantasie. The adventuring party travels from town to town using a overview map of the countryside.

Again the Dark Lord Nikademus is the players' evil opponent, having fashioned an evil orb and cast a curse on the beautiful island of Ferronrah, enslaving its people. The players' mission is to find and destroy the evil orb.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "LDW Software", "publishers": "Strategic Simulations", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantasie_II", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/3OrZIqK-bBo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72064-phantasie-ii\n"}
