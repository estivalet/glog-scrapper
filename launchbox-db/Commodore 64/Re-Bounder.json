{"altername_name": [], "name": "Re-Bounder", "overview": "Bounder is back! Again you're in control of a tennis ball, that bounces and bounces and bounces... This time you must collect smart bombs to finish the game. You need to collect all of them: 16 smart bombs. Avoid bad stuff for landing like sand, spikes, traps or enemies. Unknown squares, signed with an \"?\" awaiting you: sometimes helpful (higher/longer jumps, extra-time and soon) - other times they're traps too. Excellent parallax-scrolling, nice graphics and sounds will give you a great time with this one, easy to play - but damn' hard to win!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "July 15, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Christian P.
