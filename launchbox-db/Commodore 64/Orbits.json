{"altername_name": [], "name": "Orbits", "overview": "One of the prettiest Tetris games that I've seen. Each level is named after the planets, with a cracking SID tune to accompany it. Published in Magic Disk 64 1994/11. Tetris is still the most popular game in the world. This is proven by the numerous clones that are met with enthusiasm everywhere. In the menu you can either use the joystick in port # 2 or the keyboard. To enter a higher level, you can also select the \"ENTER PASSWORD\" option if you already have some level codes. You have to control the falling stones and place them so that they eliminate each other. If two stones of the same kind touch each other, both stones dissolve into thin air. The next level can only be reached if you can find enough space for all the stones that appear. You can see the number of stones still falling on the right side of the screen.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Marek Matula", "publishers": "CP Verlag", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4axsYabHA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/123231-orbits\n"}
