Explore a series of systems and galaxies, stringed together with wormhole technology. Upgrade your ship with various devices and use ancient artifacts. Fight pirates, aliens and ancient robots to keep alive in a hostile universe \u2013 or become a pirate yourself and take it from the rich. Every game is different, but a codeword system allows you to bring you worldly possessions into your next incarnation. So you can build up your ship to reach the final goal over many sessions.
