{"altername_name": ["911 Tiger Shark", "911 TS"], "name": "911TS", "overview": "You control a Porsche 911TS fitted with Dunlop tyres. You must travel along the road, while picking up passengers and taking them to their house. If your car travels on the grass, you do some damage. You can press the fire button on the joystick to make the car stop, which is useful for turning around and driving in a different direction. The game ends when the damage gauge reaches 300, or when your time expires.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Elite Systems", "publishers": "Elite Systems", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.05", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uvgvZLSZKE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86580-911ts\n"}
