{"altername_name": ["Olli Lissa: The Ghost of Shilmoore Castle"], "name": "Olli and Lissa", "overview": "Panic at Shilmore Castle! For years it is inhabited by ghost Sir Humphrey and his pals Olli and Lisa but it is bought up by Eugine Portcullis III Jnr who wants to break it down and ship it to the States, bit by bit. Being rather attached to his castle, Sir Humphrey wants to scare Eugene away for good. Unfortunately, Sir Humphrey has lost his ability to make himself invisible. He can only regain his power by mixing special ingredients that Olli must find. In this flick-screen platform game you control Olli who must find each ingredient and return it one after another to Sir Humphrey within a set time limit. In each screen there are spooks, snakes and bats as well as dangerous gapes to avoid. Olli cannot really die, but when touched by a baddie he gets set back at the start of a screen costing valuable time. Collect all eight ingredients and Eugine Portcullis III Jnr. will be scared away for good.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ionis Software International", "publishers": "Beau-Jolly", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.46", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olli_%26_Lissa", "video_link": "https://youtube.com/watch?v=N_zFRZ5knFU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109067-olli-and-lissa\n"}
