{"altername_name": [], "name": "Garry Kitchen's GameMaker", "overview": "Garry Kitchen's GameMaker is an IDE for the Commodore 64, Apple II, and IBM PCs, created by Garry Kitchen and released by Activision in 1985. The software is notable as the first high-level all-in-one game design product aimed at the general consumer. Of the three supported platforms the Commodore 64 version is arguably the most feature-rich, as it takes advantage of the advanced sound and color capabilities lacking in the Apple II and early PC hardware. The difference is especially noteworthy in the Sound Maker module. Two add-on disks are also available for the Commodore 64 version \u2014 Sports, and Science Fiction. These include sprites, music, and background elements for loading into GameMaker. To demonstrate the versatility of the program, the package includes several demonstration files. Among them are a demo sequence featuring animated sprites and music, a recreation of the David Crane classic Pitfall!, and a birthday greeting.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Garry Kitchen", "publishers": "Activision", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/101958-garry-kitchens-gamemaker\n"}
