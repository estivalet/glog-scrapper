{"altername_name": ["The New Zealand Story"], "name": "The NewZealand Story", "overview": "The goal of each level is to safely get Tiki through the level, avoiding enemy fire and spikes, and rescue one of his kiwi friends at the end. The weaponry starts out as arrows, but pickups can change these into bombs, lasers, or bouncing fireballs. These act a little differently, and what is useful depends upon the player's location. A distinctive feature of this game is the ability to ride a variety of flying vehicles, including balloons, blimps, and UFOs. Vehicles can be found ready for use or can be stolen from an enemy.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ocean Software", "publishers": "Ocean Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.80", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_NewZealand_Story#Ports_and_releases", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0dH1a5O0aE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6200-the-newzealand-story\n"}
