{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tau Zeta", "overview": "The master of SEUCK returns with a fantastic sideways SEUCK game in the TAU series. Tau Zeta is completely different to the previous games which were made by the same author. You fly a fleet of 3 space ships ready for an interstellar battle against the enemy alien forces. This game has some nice clever techniques and also some good graphics later on in the game. The scoring is incredibly weird, but should be easy enough for you to turn from alien symbols into numbers. Clever use of sound effects and a medium difficulty of play.
