{"altername_name": [], "name": "Rattler", "overview": "An even more challenging snake game, this one has a heck of a bite. Rattler is a top-view single-screen version of the game Snake where you must direct a constantly moving snake around the screen at 90 degree angles. The aim is to eat so many eggs that appear one at a time on the screen to move to the next level through a gap in the wall at the top of the screen. You must eat an egg within a time-limit or another egg is added to your total to eat, and the more eggs you eat then the longer you grow. If you touch yourself, hit the walls on the outside of the screen, or on later levels hit walls within the screen then you lose one of three lives. before you start the game you can select your skill level (0-4) and also how many balls bounce on the screen (0-4) and if a ball hits your head then you lose a life.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "MAK", "publishers": "Atlantis Software Ltd.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poAnhrg3JgY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109356-rattler\n"}
