{"altername_name": ["Eine Handvoll Dollars", "Eine Handvoll Dollar$", "Gun", "A Fistful of Bucks"], "name": "A Fi$tful of Buck$", "overview": "A bounty hunter must explore the desert looking for buildings \u2013 which include a bank, a cemetery, a saloon, an Indian village, a mine, and a fort. While searching for a building, he must shoot cowboys that get in his way. The bounty hunter has limited shots, so he must get some more. Once a building has been found, he can enter through the front doors and pick up the bullets and cash there. More often than not, the cash is out of reach, and in order to get it, our bounty hunter needs to navigate between platforms and climb ladders or gutters. Some buildings are occupied by their owner, who has orders to stop the bounty hunter from stealing his cash. There are two ways that he can die: being killed in the desert or falling off platforms at long distances.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ian Gray", "publishers": "Edizioni Societ\u00e0 SIPE", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z7D-uCKik", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/89219-a-fitful-of-buck\n"}
