There are two game types: beginner and advanced. In the beginner game the objective is to just pop the letters needed for the word by standing under them as they fall. One point is given for each. In the advanced game points are given for all balloons that are popped but to spell the word the joystick button has to pressed when popping the needed balloon. Both modes can be played in seven difficulty levels with increasing difficulty. Each level has between 10 and 35 sentences.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Robert Bobbio", "publishers": "Datasoft", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHXDKMhfyLA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/101884-heathcliff-fun-with-spelling\n"}
