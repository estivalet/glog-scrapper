{"altername_name": ["Shield"], "name": "Anti", "overview": "There can difficulty in precision and this missile command type game definitely illustrates that. You control a set of 4 ships, you can drop explosive charges from your spacecraft with a very small blast radius to stop the falling enemy munitions. If you don't put them exactly in the path of the falling bombs they will not take out the target. To compound this, any enemy bomb that hits the bottom removes one of your spare ships. Run out of ships and the game is over. This game was created by Axel Teichmann and published in Game On 1990/03 in German and through newsstand and subscription sales and in Italy in both Hit Parade C64 n.47 (luglio/agosto 1990) and Special Program n.65 (maggio 1990) under the name Shield.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Axel Teichmann", "publishers": "CP Verlag", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/WKrj50bcpFM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/87237-anti\n"}
