{"altername_name": [], "name": "Precision", "overview": "Precision is a game of skill and accuracy! Align your moving ball with the still ball so that it moves directly over it. It's fun and challenging. When your ball merges with the other one you get 1 point. The target ball appears in another location. Get as many before time runs out! Hold the fire button to move 3 times as fast. You start with 99 time. Every 2nd point will give you a 4 time bonus. The game will gradually speed up until 100 points. The game ends if time hits 00, or you happen to score 999 points. coding and design by Iceout.
