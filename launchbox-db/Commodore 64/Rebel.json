{"altername_name": [], "name": "Rebel", "overview": "In the future, working conditions in agridustrial combine compounds are a step back to slavery, with no prospects, long hours and poor treatment. One day THX2240 (an obvious George Lucas reference) decides she's had enough, and steals a Crowd Control vehicle to escape. Escaping from the whole 10-level complex is a big task though, as each of the many compounds has its own locks. These can be removed using mirrors to guide a solar beam onto the locks, weakening them. There are patrol guards trying to stop you, and each time you fire a beam and it fails to open a door, you lose a life. The action is viewed from above with a pseudo-3D feel.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gang of Five", "publishers": "Mastertronic", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uOkpxwj75U", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/89216-rebel\n"}
