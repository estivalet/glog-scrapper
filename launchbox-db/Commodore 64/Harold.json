{"altername_name": [], "name": "Harold", "overview": "You're a \"fraidy cat\" who happens to be scared of mice, so the mice chase you around a maze just like the ghosts do in Pac Man. And your goal is to clear the screen of cat food \"pellets\" so that you can advance to the next screen. And when you run into the catnip pouches placed here and there, this emboldens the cat for a brief time so that he can devour the mice who are chasing him (he takes on a \"wild cat\" form).", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "February 20, 2022", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dennis Osborne", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/169878-harold\n"}
