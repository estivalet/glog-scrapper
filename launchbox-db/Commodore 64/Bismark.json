{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bismark", "overview": "A one player implementation of the traditional game that used to be played with pen and paper but which is more often played as a board game these days. Released as part of the \"30 Games\" game pack. This implementation gives the player and the PC a carrier, destroyer, battleship, PT boat and a submarine which must be placed on a 10x10 grid. Ships may be placed horizontally or vertically on this grid by specifying a start co-ordinate and whether the ship is to be placed Up, Down, left or Right from that point. Ships can be re-positioned if necessary, they are not locked into place until the player presses ESC. When both players have placed their fleet they take turns to fire at the other player's grid. If it's a hit the player is informed. All tiles that a ship occupies must be hit, before a ship is sunk. The first player to sink all the other's ships wins.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Argus Press Software", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/88372-bismark\n"}
