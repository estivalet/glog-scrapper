{"altername_name": ["Flight Deck II"], "name": "Flight Deck", "overview": "The game is about an aircraft carrier hosting several aircraft of 3 kind; F-14 Tomcat for air to air dogfights, A-6 Intruders for bombing and RF-4 Phantoms for photographic reconnaissance. The purpose of the game was making aircraft take off the carrier (being very careful) then changing view to a map (seen from above) to take control of your flying aircraft and running reconnaissance missions with the Phantoms over the enemy isle/islands. Once the isle/islands had been completely explored, a hot spot appeared blinking and you had to send one of the Intruder bomber to strike the target. Since bombers didn't have extensive air to air capabilities it was a good idea to send some F-14 Tomcats as defensive support to achieve the objective.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "D.
