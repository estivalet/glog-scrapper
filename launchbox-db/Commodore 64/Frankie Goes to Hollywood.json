{"altername_name": [], "name": "Frankie Goes to Hollywood", "overview": "Playing a thoroughly drab, mundane and predictable character, your aim is to become interesting enough to reach the Pleasuredome. After discovering a gruesome murder, your interest in something greater than the routine of 80s Liverpool is awoken. You explore the streets and houses in the search of a way out. The main basis of the game involves picking up objects and using them in the correct way - most objects have more than one potential use, and misusing them is the only way the game can be lost. There are several sub-games along the way, including shoot 'em ups, a maze and a jigsaw puzzle.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "December 11, 1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Denton Designs", "publishers": "Firebird Licensees", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.11", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankie_Goes_to_Hollywood_%28video_game%29", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWKPuBO69aQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/9971-frankie-goes-to-hollywood\n"}
