{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bounder", "overview": "Bounder is a 1985 action game developed and published by Gremlin Graphics in which the player navigates a variety of courses as a bouncing tennis ball. Courses are composed of numerous tiles, which are suspended high above ground. The ball must be bounced past walls and over enemies; coming into contact with either, or plummeting over the edge of the course, results in the loss of one of the player's seven lives. Courses feature power squares, which push the tennis ball forward and allow longer jumps. These must be utilized to complete the course. Power squares are also used to enable the tennis ball to reach mystery spaces, tiles with question marks, which contain extra lives and bonus jumps which are used on bonus screens. Mystery spaces can also destroy the tennis ball, resulting in the loss of a life, through instant destruction or by freezing the ball in place while a missile flies across the play area and explodes.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gremlin Graphics Software", "publishers": "Gremlin Graphics Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounder_(video_game)", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YmveFn1jGrk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/29762-bounder\n"}
