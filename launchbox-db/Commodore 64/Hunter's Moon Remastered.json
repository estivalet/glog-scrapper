{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hunter's Moon Remastered", "overview": "The official 30th anniversary PAL cartridge edition of the classic Commodore 64 shoot 'em up. Originally released in 1987, Hunter's Moon became an instant classic thanks to its measured balance of strategic planning and psychotic blasting. Boasting one of the earliest uses of procedurally-generated content in a computer game, Hunter's Moon pushed the boundaries of the genre and helped redefine what a shoot 'em up could be. Hunter's Moon Remastered will be the first release from the Thalamus Remastered collection, which will feature cartridge versions of classic Thalamus games tweaked and updated in various ways including more levels, improved graphics and in-game music for this game. This version will also have hint pages, a trainer mode and game saving, localized text and password/game saves.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2018", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dan Hotop", "publishers": "Thalamus", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtcrjGMtjXQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/118021-hunters-moon-remastered\n"}
