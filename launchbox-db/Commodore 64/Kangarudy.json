{"altername_name": [], "name": "Kangarudy", "overview": "The objective of the game is to get your van and kangaroo from one place to the next in pursuit of either water or land, as indicated on the options screen. There are four routes to choose from. Keep your kangaroo bouncing on the top of your van by pressing right to speed the van up, and left to slow it down. Up and down are used to pick slopes to drive on when you get to them. Choosing the wrong one may result in hitting a boulder! Pressing fire while the kangaroo is in the air gives him a parachute that keeps him in the air for longer if things get tricky \"down under\". He can also fly on a rocket pack briefly if you press fire and right. Various pests such as rabbits crash your van if driven over so hit the horn (press fire while the kangaroo is down, sport) to get rid of them. There are also broken bridges in which you have to speed up and jump (press up). The status panel consists of three icons that are depleted like pieces of a pie. The first is a red moon that stands for time, the second is the van's energy, and the third the kangaroo's energy. The fourth icon is how many parachutes you have left. The balloons, if collected, give you a letter of the word \"RUDY\" something special happens if you collect all four. They can also increase time remaining and the height of your trampoline.
