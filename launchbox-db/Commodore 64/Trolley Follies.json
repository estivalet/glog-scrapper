{"altername_name": [], "name": "Trolley Follies", "overview": "Trolley Follies is a game for the Commodore 64 (or an emulator such as VICE) for one or two players. The object is to drive a trolley around picking up passengers and delivering them to their destinations. The track layouts get increasingly convoluted and confusing as the levels progress. Passengers are impatient and your score will be determined by how happy they are when you drop them off, their happiness is determined by how long they had to wait. Passengers left waiting at platforms for too long will leave and that will actually hurt your score. There is a time limit for each level as well as a minimum required score you must achieve before the exit to the next level is opened. If there is time remaining you may continue to pick up and drop off passengers after the exit is open to increase your score. Your highest score for the level will be recorded in a high scores file and the next time you play that level you will need to exceed your previous best to progress. Although this feature may be disabled and you can choose to reset the high scores file from the main menu. Also included is a level editor so that you can create new levels.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2018", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Black Castle Software", "publishers": "Jaded Chicken", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNePuSb3Q8M", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/115257-trolley-follies\n"}
