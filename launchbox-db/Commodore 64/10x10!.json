{"altername_name": [], "name": "10x10!", "overview": "Complete rows or columns using the Tetris-style blocks to clear them. You score one point per square filled, and can clear multiple columns or rows in one move to score bonuses. When no moves are possible, the game ends. Getting a high score will involve careful planning to make sure you don't leave yourself with a block that cannot be placed! This game is based on a mobile game called 1010. However, the developer added a number of extra Tetris pieces that aren't in the mobile version, which increases the difficulty and gives more variety to the gameplay.
