{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ramparts", "overview": "Not to be confused with Atari Games' Rampart, Ramparts is in fact a clone of Bally Midways' Rampage, but with a medieval theme, and players are giant knights instead of monsters. The game is for one or two players simultaneously. The game takes place on a single screen, where the player(s) can move left and right on one foreground plane, and the object is to destroy a castle, each phase, by scaling and punching the individual buildings until each, and all collapses. Buildings will often overlap, requiring some to be taken down before others. Players will be harassed by witches, goblins, archers and the like.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "July 1, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Future Concepts", "publishers": "GO!
