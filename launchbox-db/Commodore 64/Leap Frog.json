{"altername_name": [], "name": "Leap Frog", "overview": "Meet Ribbit the frog. Unlike most frogs, Ribbit is a strict vegetarian. Still, the dragonflies at this pond are irresistible, and he enjoys swatting them from the air with his long tongue. Unfortunately for Ribbit, a neighborhood snake has acquired a taste for frog. The game begins with Ribbit making his way to the center of a log. Flies descend from above and them move about the screen. Fire to send Ribbit's tongue darting out to swat the dragonflies from the air. But be sure to dodge each one as it drops, if one hits the frog he will assume it is the snake out to get him and hop off to safety. If the snake touches the frog he will hop off the screen to safety and you will lose one frog. Clear all the dragonflies to move to the next, more difficult screen.
