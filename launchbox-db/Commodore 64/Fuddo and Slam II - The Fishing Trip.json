{"altername_name": [], "name": "Fuddo and Slam II: The Fishing Trip", "overview": "Subtitled as \"The Fishing-Trip (Brown Trout and Goblins)\". Written with PunyInform V1.8. If you are a fan of Fuddo and Slam then here is a little romp for you to enjoy - hopefully. The game was actually written to illustrate the option in 'PunyInform' to change between the main characters and thereby utilize their individual talents ... not that Slam has much more than his love of food and breaking things. In this game we follow the two \"boggits\" Fuddo and Slam (many of John Wilson's games take place in a parody world based on Tolkien's universe). Roughly speaking, this game is a treasure hunt. I don't want to reveal much, as part of the game is figuring out what the objective is from some subtle clues in various locations. You can get 230 points maximum, but not all points are required. Also, expect a few maze-like locations.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2020", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "John Wilson", "publishers": "Zenobi Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/178213-fuddo-and-slam-ii-the-fishing-trip\n"}
