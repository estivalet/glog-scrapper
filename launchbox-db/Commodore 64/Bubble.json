{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bubble", "overview": "A collect'em up style game created by Trond Brenna and available in 64'er 1991/06. Bubble is a game of five levels. On a grid-like Playing field are some red and blue stones distributed. You have to collect them with your so-called bubble, a ball-like structure. For every red there are four, blue stones are worth 2 points. But the whole thing would be without difficulty and not fun at all if it weren't for an enemy computer-controlled object chasing you. If it catches you, one of your lives is wasted. Once all stones have been collected, the next level, of course, a little harder so you won't lose interest in collecting stones.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Trond Brenna", "publishers": "Markt & Technik", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90102-bubble\n"}
