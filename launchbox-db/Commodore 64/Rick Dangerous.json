{"altername_name": [], "name": "Rick Dangerous", "overview": "You play Rick Dangerous, an Indiana Jones type who's on a quest to find the lost Coolu Amazon tribe. However, his plane crashes in the middle of a bunch of crazed Coolus. Hopefully he's up to the challenge of escaping. If he is, he will find himself in the pyramid of Egypt with no easy way past leaders and their minions, and then engulfed in a web of traps in a Nazi base. Rick Dangerous is a platform game across over 100 screens, in which Rick has his gun in one hand, and dynamite sticks in another. You must take a methodical approach to clearing each screen, as there are traps in place which will need memorizing and preempting where possible. Use the dynamite wisely, for enemies you can't get into the purely-horizontal range of your gun.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Core Design", "publishers": "Firebird Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.31", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Dangerous", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwBIDlcMU5Y", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/33391-rick-dangerous\n"}
