{"altername_name": ["T-Rex 64"], "name": "T-Rex", "overview": "Help this little green monster in reaching the end of each level. Avoid deadly obstacles such as cactuses, birds, snakes and scorpios. Don't even ask why she is constantly running. T-Rex 64 offers 14 action packed levels in 3 distinct worlds, dedicated music, joystick and keyboard support. This single file game works well with real machines and emulators, any CBM disk drive, tape, SD2IEC and Easy Flash. Both PAL and NTSC machines are supported, except for \"the very early 64 cycles per raster\" NTSC variants. If you have any problems with this particular VIC-II model, please post a comment below and I'll try to fix it. Pro tip: if you're bored with PAL version, try NTSC - the gameplay is more \"interesting\" there! Released by BOBR games as part of the Double Dino compilation cartridge.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "February 19, 2022", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Maciej Ma\u0142ecki", "publishers": "Bobr Games", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z6pSFvVEh8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/159601-t-rex\n"}
