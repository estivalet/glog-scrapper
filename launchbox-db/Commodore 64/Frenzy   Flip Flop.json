{"altername_name": ["EduFun! Mathfun! Frenzy / Flip Flop", "EduFun! Mathfun! Frenzy & Flip Flop"], "name": "Frenzy / Flip Flop", "overview": "Frenzy & Flip Flop (also titled Edufun! Frenzy & Flip Flop) is a release with two educational math games. In Frenzy, the player must quickly answer 20 subtraction or division questions before a hungry alligator eats 10 fish. If any fish are remaining, the player receives a bonus game where they control a smiling face which tries to capture as many numbers as possible, while avoiding crashing into cherry bombs or mean faces. The smiley face can move in the cardinal directions. In Flip Flop, the player is shown 10 rounds of 2 figures. The player must decide if the figure on the left can be moved to look exactly like the figure on the right. The player also must state if the objects would match if slid, flipped, or turned. A perfect score receives a special message. Unlike the Apple II and Atari 8-bit versions, the C64 version was published by Commodore Business Machines themselves.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Commodore Business Machines, Inc.", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/129418-frenzy-flip-flop\n"}
