{"altername_name": [], "name": "Stoneage64", "overview": "In this Boulder Dash style game you're \"Willy Beisser\", a stone-age guy digging for cabbages in caves to provide yummy meal for his family. And that's it. Once you collected all cabbages in one cave, it's \"solved\" and you can tackle the next one. This is a port of an old AmigaBASIC game from 1986 by Zirias. Though the game \"borrows\" from Boulder Dash. But be aware, it works VERY differently. Some key differences, there are no monsters, rocks never \"explode\" (but may roll off), you CAN'T run away from rocks, but you CAN move diagonally (which is sometimes necessary to solve a level). All in all, it's about planning ahead and doing the correct steps. A mini map is available on the bottom right to help navigate.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "January 27, 2023", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Zirias", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uRbwNRJLY4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/169676-stoneage64\n"}
