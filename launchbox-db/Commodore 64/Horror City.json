{"altername_name": ["Judge Death"], "name": "Horror City", "overview": "This is a computer game about using a gun to shoot things. Alien things. In a futuristic city. I'm not really narrowing this down much, am I? It's Novotrade's 1989 Commodore 64 crosshair shooter Horror City! You start in Horror City, ready to put an end to whatever evil lurks on its streets and subway concourses. You play as Sinclair as she shoots in this Judge Dredd themed game without the official attribution. You must shoot directly at the teleport globes on your enemies belts, rather than just blasting the baddies, it is easier said than done.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "E.
