{"altername_name": ["The Soldier Yeteran Defends for Earth"], "name": "The Soldier Yeteran Defend to Earth", "overview": "You are the soldier, Yeteran who has a tough mission on his hands. A space ship approached planet Earth and spawned out hoards of cheekily little aliens. They want to get rid of the human race, and take Earth as their own new home. You arm yourself with a pulse laser rifle and start zapping away at the aliens. Warning, your mission won't be all that easy. Since it is just one person against a large army of aliens. Good luck Yeteran.
