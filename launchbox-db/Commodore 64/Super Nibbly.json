{"altername_name": [], "name": "Super Nibbly", "overview": "Super Nibbly is a Snake-variant where you control a worm in a maze, eating pills while growing. The game is a successor to the previous game by the same developer, Nibbly '92 The game starts with an overview map, where the snake moves on a path on a group of islands, going from location to location while having some non-interactive funny animation events on the way. At each named village, the game switches to a maze screen where the player can control the snake. The mazes are similar in layout as the pac-man style maze, a fixed single screen, only without enemies. The objective is for the snake to eat all pills/cookies in the maze, before returning to the overhead map and moving to the next location.
