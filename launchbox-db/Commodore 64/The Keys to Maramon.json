The Keys to Maramon is an adventure role-playing game where the mission of the characters is to rescue the town of Maramon. Initially, the player can choose from one of several adventurers who have different strengths and weaknesses. The protagonist begins by accepting a position from the mayor of Maramon to protect the town from monsters. The daytime is peaceful and can be spent exploring or resting to recover health. Every night, monsters come from some of the towers and attempt to loot and pillage Maramon. Initially, the player doesn't have any keys to access the locked towers, but by carefully searching and fighting, the player can discover the keys. The towers contain some mysteries, treasure, and ultimately the \"source\" of the monsters. The game is won by exploring the towers and eliminating the source, which will end the relentless nightly cycle of monster attacks.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Knight Technologies", "publishers": "Mindcraft Software", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Keys_to_Maramon", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/110400-the-keys-to-maramon\n"}
