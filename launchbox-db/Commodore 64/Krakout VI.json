{"altername_name": ["Krakout 6"], "name": "Krakout VI", "overview": "All new levels for this Arkanoid-style Breakout clone, which unlike most other similar games has the bat on the side of the screen (there is a left/right option) instead of at the bottom. There are a number of types of special bricks, but unlike e.g. Arkanoid, they do not fall towards the bat. Instead, when you hit a special brick, it flips to show a letter. E.g. E (Extend bat), C (Catch ball), M (Missile), B (Bomb, explodes when hit by ball, clearing a number of bricks) and X (Extra life). Extra lives are also awarded when the player scores 10,000 points.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Andrew Green", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/131941-krakout-vi\n"}
