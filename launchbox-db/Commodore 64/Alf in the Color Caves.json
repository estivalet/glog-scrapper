{"altername_name": [], "name": "Alf in the Color Caves", "overview": "ALF is not the character from the TV sitcom. This ALF is a true blue (literally) kinda guy. Using your joystick, lead ALF through the Color Caves. Squoosh him through the squooshy parts, wriggle him through the wriggly parts, zig-zag him through the zig-zaggy parts. But watch out for the Wufflegumps. These pairs of eyes will try to block you. If you bump them, they'll send you back to the start. If you get ALF to the Color Room, he will change colors and do a dance for you. Then you can move him up the tunnel to the beginning to go again with more Wufflegumps. ALF in the Color Caves teaches children prediction and routing skills and cause-and-effect relationships.
