{"altername_name": [], "name": "Arcade Volleyball", "overview": "Arcade Volleyball is a simple, two-player (human or computer) volleyball-like game where you have to, simply enough, bang the ball so that it hits the opposite player's ground. Some basic rules apply: when the ball's current owner loses a round (either because the ball touched the ground or he touched it for three times) the opposite player becomes the owner. If a player is not the owner of the ball and loses a round, the opposite player gains a point. The game is over when either player reaches 15 points. The game was published in the following: COMPUTE!'s Gazette 1988/06 (Issue #60), Best of Gazette 1988 (Disk Issue) / a 1-player option was added unofficially by the cracking group Army of Darkness in 2020.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "David Hensley Jr.", "publishers": "COMPUTE!
