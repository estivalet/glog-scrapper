{"altername_name": [], "name": "Marble Springs", "overview": "An Arkanoid/Breakout style game published in Magic Disk 64 1993/03. However in this game, instead of bricks, you have to take out a segmented snake/centipede-like creature in every level. \"Marble Springs\" is not just any Arkanoid variant. No, it also brings the action aspect into play. There are not diverse, colorful stones romping about on the playing field, but a real dragon scurrying untiringly through the landscape. With bat and ball you must now hunt down this dangerous opponent. If you move the joystick up or down, you can determine the energy portion of the ball. A great deal of sensitivity is required, because a strong charge of energy can cause great damage, but it also increases the speed of the ball. The ultimate goal is to find a balance between damage and control, because if the ball leaves the lower edge of the screen, it means the loss of a life. When the score ends at \"400\" or \"800\", you automatically get a wider pad. Now the energy can safely be increased as the impact probability has improved significantly. The oversized pad only disappears as soon as you lose a life or get to the next level. In order to get hold of a ball that you thought was lost, you can press the fire button in addition to the direction of movement in order to accelerate the pad considerably.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jan B.
