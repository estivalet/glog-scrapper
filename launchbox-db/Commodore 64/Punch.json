{"altername_name": [], "name": "Punch", "overview": "Punch is a take on the \"Pong\" genre of games for 1-2 players. However, instead of playing as two paddles, you play two guys wearing boxing gloves and have to \"Punch\" at the ball to make it go toward the other side, hence the name. If the ball hits you in the face it's considered a lost ball, but it doesn't result in a point for the second player, like in all Pong games, points are only scored if they pass through the player. The game was developed by Mark Jordan and published by Commodore themselves in Commodore Power/Play Vol.5 N.1 (February/March 1986), but also published in Loadstar #21.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "February 1, 1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mark Jordan", "publishers": "Commodore Business Machines", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/369251-punch\n"}
