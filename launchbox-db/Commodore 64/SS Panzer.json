{"altername_name": ["SS.Panzer"], "name": "SS Panzer", "overview": "Leutnant Karl Kesseking had sworn the Oath and, as member of the elite Waken SS Panzer Division, there was no escape from the bonds of obedience and dedication to his comrades and the Fatherland even unto death. Kapitan Von Moltke had balanced all the factors and knew that only the sacrifice of his top tank command and crew would allow the regiment to escape from th encircling Bolshevik forces before the onset of the dreaded Russian winter. \"Leutnant. You will take your tank towards Leningrad and destroy everything in your path.\" Von Moltke paused for Kesselring to comment but the Leutnant stood motionless before him. \"You must understand that your action will divert the Bolshevik's attention and buy the Regiment time to withdraw. You will continue to attack the enemy until all your resources are spent. Verstehen?\" -Ya Wahl! Mein Kapitanis was Kesseking's response as he turned and mounted his tank. There could be a other answer. Discipline, obedience and loyalty to his Comrades blanked out any other reply. Karl knew that he and his crew had drawn a suicide mission, but after four weary years of useless war he was pleased that it soon would be finished. Can you assist Karl and his crew to break through the enemy lines and give them a fighting chance o/ survival?", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Chris Yates", "publishers": "Capital Software Designs", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/112794-ss-panzer\n"}
