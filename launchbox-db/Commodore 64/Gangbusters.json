{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gangbusters", "overview": "Gangbusters is a turn-based, text-based Gangster simulator requiring at least two players. Beginning with the start of prohibition and ending when one player becomes the Godfather (or when the Feds get too wise to the situation), Gangbusters takes the players through the life of crime: extortion, gambling, pay-offs, taking out contracts, serving time, and spending money. Each player completes their turn (one year gametime) by issuing orders on several screens, deciding how to invest money, and then reading summary reports at the end to see how well you've done. Random events, like Fed crack downs, could mean you spend some time in jail, dropping big bucks at the racetrack attracts positive and negative attention, stealing limos puts your neck on the line, and hitmen are always one phone call away.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Prickly-Pear Software", "publishers": "Prickly-Pear Software", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "6", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8ZEffPvpXs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/101954-gangbusters\n"}
