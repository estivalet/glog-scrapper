{"altername_name": [], "name": "Rowly", "overview": "You get to move your little worm, named \"Rowly\", through five different rooms, each of which contain a lot of pills that you need to collect. With every eaten pill the length of Rowly will increase by one element. When all pills in the room are swallowed you will move on to the next room. Be careful not to cross the path of your own end or it will spell your doom. There is a time limit for each of the rooms. If you manage to clear the five rooms, you will restart at the first room but things will move a bit faster!
