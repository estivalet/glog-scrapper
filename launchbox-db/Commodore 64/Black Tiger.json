You must go through several areas, destroying monsters that get in your way. Along the way, you will come across old men, which when rescued, will give you a range of items that include extra time, more vitality, or more coins, or they might sell you items, including armor upgrades, weapons, keys for treasure chests, anti-poisoning potions. But, as always, you need to collect coins, which can be obtained by destroying certain monsters or breaking a series of pots.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "SoftWorks", "publishers": "U.S. Gold", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.47", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Tiger_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnIO9JsaCg8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75338-black-tiger\n"}
