{"altername_name": [], "name": "Air Traffic Controller", "overview": "Could you control the air traffic at a busy airport? Air Traffic Controller gives you the chance. Three skill and five difficulty levels will indicate to you whether you can control a big international airport - or a disused runway. Aircraft move on your radar screen with each sweep of the RADAR. Radio directional and altitude commands are transmitted through the keyboards. Ten aircraft could be in the sky at one time waiting to land. Be careful not to cause a mid-air collision or lose an aircraft. So be careful, many lives are in your hands!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Andrew Fisher", "publishers": "South Pacific Software", "genres": "Flight Simulator", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W191hfHYjE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/116252-air-traffic-controller\n"}
