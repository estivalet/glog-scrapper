{"altername_name": [], "name": "Chevy Chase", "overview": "Chevy Chase is a racing game with one of two Chevy oldtimers. You race against the time in four levels with different sections. The car is shown from behind like in Outrun and you drive along a street. Using two gears you try to overtake cars that block your way on the street. Corners will make your tires squeal. Hitting obstacles like cars or signs will make you slower but you cannot crash.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "PAL Developments", "publishers": "Hi-Tec Software", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdYbsqyzIrk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90633-chevy-chase\n"}
