{"altername_name": [], "name": "Riddles and Stones", "overview": "Riddles and Stones is a puzzle game where you look down on a grid made up of blocks that are either a wall, a floor tile with a symbol, or a block which generates sliding blocks with symbols matching the floor tiles. The object is to slide the tiles in the correct order to make a path through the grid from one arrow to the other arrow. Once a block is created it will only stay on a square with the same symbol and the blocks won't stop sliding until it hits something. The game is controlled by a joystick.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Rene Lerch", "publishers": "Renne Softworks", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/159251-riddles-and-stones\n"}
