This is a race for two players only to grab as many of those presents as possible. The first player to reach their quota wins the game. Watch out though because there are huge snowballs falling from the screen. If one of those hit you or your opponent, then it will freeze the player for a short period of time. Using the fire button will allow Splidge or his friend to jump.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2004", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Richard Bayliss", "publishers": "The New Dimension (TND)", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NGVgAp_4eA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/127837-snowball-caper-ii\n"}
