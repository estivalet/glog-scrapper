{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tug-of-War", "overview": "Tug-of-War is a two player game consisting of a canyon with a rope stretched across the top, held by a team of three figures on either side. A small UFO flies overhead and each player takes turns in dropping a parachute from it, attempting to land on a target which appears lower down the screen in a random position. Every time a parachutist hits the target, the opposing team is pulled further towards the edge of the canyon and if a man topples over the precipice, the team is weakened. The winner is the player who succeeds in pulling all the opposing team over the edge of the canyon.
