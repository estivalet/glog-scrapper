{"altername_name": [], "name": "Alpha Anxiety", "overview": "Alpha Anxiety is a cross between an educational game and a board/memory game in which you have to find all 26 letters of the alphabet in order on the board. However unlike most memory games, the game is timed, so you only have a certain amount of time to find the letters. The game was developed by Craig Howarth and published as a type-in listing in COMPUTE!'s Gazette 1985/03 (Issue #21). It was also released in Italy by J.Soft s.r.l. in Super VIC & C64 A2-N10 (November 1985)", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Craig Howarth", "publishers": "COMPUTE!
