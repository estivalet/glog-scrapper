{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mini-Zork II", "overview": "Infocom released Zork 1, 2 and 3 in the early 80s. They were all made to be playable on the home computers of the day using a disk drive. As some of you are aware, they also created a cut-down version of Zork 1, called Mini-Zork 1, which was just small enough to fit into memory on a C64, so that it could be distributed on tape. This game was sold for a while in the UK, and possibly in some other markets. It was also included on a cover-tape with the C64 magazine Zzap! 64 in 1990. A lesser known fact is that they created Mini-Zork 2 as well, a cut-down version or Zork 2, small enough to fit in the memory of a C64. For one reason or another, they abandonded the project when it was sort-of-completed and mostly working. 30+ years later, the source code of all their games emerged, including this project. Torbj\u00f6rn Andersson has put in the work to fix all bugs he could find in this game. Before he started, it definitely wasn\u2019t possible to play the game to completion.
