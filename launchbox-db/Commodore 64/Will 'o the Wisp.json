{"altername_name": [], "name": "Will 'o the Wisp", "overview": "Will 0' the Wisp is a great adventure game for devious and nimble minded computophiles. Trudging through a vast forest in the guise of a fairly simple minded woodsman, and destined to wed the fair Brunhilde on the morn, the player seeks a final day of adventurous freedom before the dread shackles of marriage are fixed firmly about his ankles. The poor fool recklessly throws his life on the mere whims of the program until, eventually, more by good luck than management, he finds himself outside the Great Cave. Tempted in by a floating wisp of mist the player ventures fearlessly on, then to his surprise a rumbling sounds behind him, the doors to the cave swing shut, and the only way to go is onwards. Dread horrors await the fearless woodland yokel, and this is all you are going to get, dear Reader. Onward and may the best yokel win!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mark Capella", "publishers": "Duckworth Home Computing", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/170132-will-o-the-wisp\n"}
