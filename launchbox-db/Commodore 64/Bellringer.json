{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bellringer", "overview": "This is the first game in the Bellringer series, and it was submitted as a 4KB entry to the 2003 MiniGame Compo. You are the Bellringer, whose mission is to find your way through four sections of a castle. The sections are separated by four thick brick walls which need to be lowered by ringing four bells in the correct order. There are eight bells at the end of each castle section, and all except one of them will lower one wall and raise another when you pull their rope. You need to be positioned just below a bell and then jump straight up in order to pull its rope.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2003", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Geir Straume", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/88267-bellringer\n"}
