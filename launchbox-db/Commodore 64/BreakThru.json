{"altername_name": ["Breakthru in 3D", "3-D Brickaway"], "name": "BreakThru", "overview": "This is a racquetball-like game that is best described as a 3D variation of Breakout. You are at the end on a rectangular room. On the other end is a wall made of bricks or blocks. The ball travels down to the wall and knocks out a brick. It then returns to your end where you must use a squarish paddle to send the ball back to the wall. If the ball gets past the paddle, you lose a ball. In the computer version, you must knock out all the bricks of the wall to advance. Each level has more bricks per wall. You begin with 5 balls. In the console version, you must knock out 57 of the 72 bricks to advance. Each level has 72 bricks but the number of balls will lower in later levels. Level 1 starts with 99 balls.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Britt Monk CDP", "publishers": "The Avalon Hill Game Company", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.09", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXSBjM1k-oc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90076-breakthru\n"}
