{"altername_name": [], "name": "Super Stock Car", "overview": "Super Stock Car is a scrolling overhead driving game where just part of the track is shown on the screen and the game scrolls when you move your car. You have to drive over various tracks against three other computer controlled cars and finish 1st over a number of set laps. If you finish 1st then you move to the next track, fail to finish 1st and it's game over. Hitting the sides or other cars slows your car down but no damage is inflicted.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Virgin Games", "publishers": "Mastertronic Plus", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGQe9euJcg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113487-super-stock-car\n"}
