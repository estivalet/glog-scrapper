{"altername_name": [], "name": "Super Seven", "overview": "A kind of Tetris puzzle game, but with a difference. The aim of this game is to drop a dice on top of one of the dices that is in the bottom of the container. Each dice switches it's value, and your job is to simply match the value of your dice to one of the dice at the bottom of the screen. If you mess up, then a life will be lost. Once all lives are lost, it is game over.
