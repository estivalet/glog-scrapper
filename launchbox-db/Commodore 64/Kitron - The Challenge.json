{"altername_name": [], "name": "Kitron: The Challenge", "overview": "Published in Magic Disk 64 1994/11. Kitron: The Challenge is a Tron style head to head duel with a larger than normal playing area. This is the first TRON remake with a learning computer opponent. A little routine that artificial intelligence generates lets the opponent learn from his mistakes so that he will not make the same mistake again in the same situation. There is also a brake with which you can drive more slowly in corners. The brake is activated with the fire button. This help has no negative influence, because the opponent also slows down. Due to the learning effect of the opponent, it can be that the opponent commits obvious \"stupidities\" in the first 2-3 levels. Don't be surprised - at higher levels you will likely need precise strategies to win. To do this, the game can be paused by moving the joystick in the opposite direction of travel. Before starting the game, you have the following options/game modes: \u2022 DUEL MASTER: The game takes place with the opponent on an empty field. \u2022 LABYRINTH: The opponent must be caught in different labyrinths that increase in difficulty. \u2022 HANDICAPDUEL: This mode creates random Barriers on the field of play, requiring increased Player attention.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Vislogic", "publishers": "CP Verlag", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109211-kitron-the-challenge\n"}
