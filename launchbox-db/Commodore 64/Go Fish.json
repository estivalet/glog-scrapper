{"altername_name": [], "name": "Go Fish", "overview": "A game created by Tim Hartnell & Brett Hale and published in 1984 in the book \"The Big Fat Book of Commodore 64 Games\". The computer plays a mean hand in this electronic version of the well-known card game. The aim of the game is to build up a series of 'books', where a book is all four of a particular card (such as four Aces, or four nines). You start the game with five cards each. You can see your cards but (of course) you cannot see the computer's hand. The two players take it in turns to ask their opponents tor a particular card which they need to help build up a set. If the player being asked does not have a requested card, the 'asker' must GO FISH (that is, select a card from those which have not been dealt).", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Brett Hale", "publishers": "Interface Publications", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/166128-go-fish\n"}
