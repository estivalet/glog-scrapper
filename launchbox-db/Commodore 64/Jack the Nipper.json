{"altername_name": [], "name": "Jack the Nipper", "overview": "\"Jack the Nipper is a platform game that contains 50 screens packed with action. Jack is an evil and wicked toddler. You play Jack and you have to cause as much trouble without being penalized for it. To see how naughty you've been there is a naughtyometer at the bottom of the screen. To cause some mayhem Jack must jump on things, pick up objects and drop those at places where they cause the most trouble to grown-ups. The various objects can be found all over town and at Jack's home. The game starts at Jack's home but Jack can walk out the door and go into town to, for example, blow up the police station, kill all flowers or free prisoners. Try to get a credit card and do some serious shopping! The first thing you should look for is you peashooter and fire peas at various objects or persons. Toot your horn to frustrate grown-ups or animals. The naughtier your the higher your naughtyometer goes up! The game comes to an end as the naughtyometer reaches 100%. Cause as much trouble as you can... but don't get spanked for it by grown-ups!\" --mobygames.com", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "January 1, 1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gremlin Graphics Software", "publishers": "Gremlin Graphics Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.50", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_the_Nipper", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lnNcqMF4Ks", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27317-jack-the-nipper\n"}
