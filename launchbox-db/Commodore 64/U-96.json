{"altername_name": [], "name": "U-96", "overview": "A board game style game published in Magic Disk 64 1992/12 based loosely on Battleship. The life in the classroom can get pretty boring in the long run. For this reason, shrewd backbenchers integrated a really great game into everyday school life a long time ago. Of course we're talking about the good old \"sinking ships\" or Battleship game that could be played with graph paper. \"U-96\" now simulates this math notebook filler on your bread box at home. After the start, you can first decide whether you want to compete against the really strong computer opponent or rather dare a cozy game for two (F1). In the positioning round that follows you have to place your ships as inconspicuously as possible so that the evil enemy cannot hit you straight away. The computer then naturally takes over the evaluation. It indicates the number of hits and at the same time marks the damaged parts of the ship. Then the counter-offensive will start immediately. A total of 20 shots are available to you to scratch the enemy's fleet a little. But you should still exercise caution, because it could be that you only sank a mine.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "S\u00f6ren Kress", "publishers": "CP Verlag", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-j0l3yvGSQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/134592-u-96\n"}
