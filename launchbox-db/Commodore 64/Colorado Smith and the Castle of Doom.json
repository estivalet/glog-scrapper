As we all know, archeologists are not only part-time geologists and experts in old languages, they're also terrific swimmers, pilots, combatants, horsemen and shooters. Well in the Castle of Doom you must outwit a ghost and then try not to outwit yourself. This is a fast-paced, two part maze game. You, Colorado, face two challenges. 1. The Gems of Wisdom 2. The Stones of Korinth For both parts use a joystick to move N, S, E or W. You may also use the cursor keys. In the Gems of Wisdom you must help Colorado collect the 25 gems of wisdom before the music stops. You must NOT allow the ghost to touch you. In the Stones of Korinth your task is to collect as many of the flashing crystals as possible before the music stops. Fore each crystal you collect, you receive 100 points, and a stone replaces the crystal. When you walk through a stone you lost 10 points and the stone turns into a skull. You cannot walk through a skull, if you surround yourself with skulls you have entombed yourself!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "James C.
