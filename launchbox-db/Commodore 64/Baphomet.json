{"altername_name": [], "name": "Baphomet", "overview": "A SEUCK game by Anthony Burns in conjunction with The New Dimension for one or two players, with cooperative play available. NOTE: This game contains nudity and situations that some may found offensive. This is to some degree a one-player game, but it uses both joysticks, so two player is naturally easier. You start the game on foot, using joystick port two (If you try to start using port one, you will not be able to progress beyond the opening screen). If you can get past level 2, you will be instructed to switch to port one. From this point on, you will be flying, and the game will scroll automatically. When you are told to \u201cstand by\u201d do not move the joystick, or you risk colliding with dangerous areas of the background. These have been placed in such a way as to make certain levels inaccessible to the \u201cwalker\u201d and others to the \u201cflyer\u201d so that they can only be on-screen at the correct time. When you are on-foot, you fight at close range, in the direction you are pointing. Do not venture off the grey walkways: the infrastructure of the conversion centre is deadly to the touch, and keep clear of the walkway edges where the passage is narrow. Similar caution applies when you are flying: steer clear of anything that is not plain sky (unless it is a bonus pickup). When you are flying, you fire forwards, with a long-range weapon.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2009", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Anthony Burns", "publishers": "The New Dimension (TND)", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJZvdnllZMk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/367883-baphomet\n"}
