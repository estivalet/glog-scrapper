{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bottle Neck", "overview": "Bottle Neck is a homebrew puzzle game for the Commodore 64. You have to move the blocks, so they remove the bottle caps that are on the screen by matching the blocks to their colors. You can also match the blocks to the other blocks as well, but you only get points if they are on top of a bottle cap and remove the cap. The game is similar to Dr. Mario in that regard. The game was developed by Michael Riley and released into the public domain in 1992.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Michael Riley", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/155717-bottle-neck\n"}
