{"altername_name": ["Zork II: The Wizard of Frobozz"], "name": "Zork II", "overview": "The AFGNCAAP begins in the Barrow from Zork I armed only with the trusty brass lantern and sword of elvish antiquity. The purpose of the game is not initially clear. The Wizard of Frobozz is soon introduced. The wizard was once a respected enchanter, but when his powers began to fade he was exiled by Dimwit Flathead. Now bordering on senility, the wizard is still a force to be reckoned with. Your goal, as you venture into the wizard's realm, is to avoid his capricious tricks and learn to control his magic. Like its predecessor, Zork II is essentially a treasure hunt. Unlike the previous game, the ten treasures are tied together by a crude plot. Finding the treasures does not end the game, nor are all the treasures needed to finish the game. Instead, the adventurer must figure out a way to use the treasures in order to reach the game's finale.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Infocom", "publishers": "Commodore Electronics", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.57", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork_II", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4frtYF9ia2c", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6231-zork-ii\n"}
