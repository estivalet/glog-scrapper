{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dip Diver", "overview": "Released in Your Commodore 1991/06 (Tape #18). An excellent undersea wobbler of a game. Set deep beneath the sea, you play a diver who has stumbled across a load of treasure and you want to make off with it pretty quickly. At least, before anyone else comes along. You have to negotiate the tortuous rock passageways and collect all the flashing treasure objects. Unfortunately, there are lots of hostile creatures trundling around these caverns and they're not too nice to touch. They won't go for your throat but you'l die if you touch them. No sea monsters were harmed in the playing of this game, so you'll have to use your skill and wits to avoid them and the rock walls that will rip your suit open. Do all this while watching your air supply so you can top up at Air Rooms dotted about the place. Dive in and let rip!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Richard Taylor", "publishers": "Alphavite Publications", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/96521-dip-diver\n"}
