{"altername_name": [], "name": "Iceball", "overview": "In Iceball the player takes the role of a bouncing ball which has to solve many levels. The goal of every non-scrolling level is to collect all diamonds which are divided over the floating platforms. Moving and stationary hazards like aliens, bombs, lasers or spikes are best avoided because the ball is only capable of jumping. The air pressure of the ball has to be regularly refilled by jumping on special blocks.
