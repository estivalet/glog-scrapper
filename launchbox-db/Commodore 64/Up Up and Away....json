{"altername_name": ["Up Up and Away"], "name": "Up Up and Away...", "overview": "Up Up and Away is a horizontal scrolling game where you have to fly a hot air balloon from base to base avoiding obstacles such as clouds, trees, kites, birds and people throwing rocks. You have a limited supply of sandbags and fuel and these decrease the higher the difficulty level is (0-5). Moving the balloon upwards consumes fuel so careful control needs to be observed. Sandbags can be used to hit people or hit icons with the letter P to improve your score. Refuelling stations to land on are also along your route. The keyboard or a joystick is used to control the balloon.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gwyll Jones, Peter Judd", "publishers": "Argus Press Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPY7QgvHVz4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/116118-up-up-and-away\n"}
