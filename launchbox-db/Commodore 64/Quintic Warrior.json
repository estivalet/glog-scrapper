{"altername_name": ["Q Force Control"], "name": "Quintic Warrior", "overview": "The player controls a spacecraft over a grid of dots and can move across the screen and shoot in all eight directions. Hordes of mutants (small creatures of indefinite appearance and of different colors) appear at the base of the screen and slowly advance upwards and must be hit before they reach the upper side, otherwise the game is lost instantly. Along the lower edge and the two side edges there are three laser cannons, in the style of the best known Gridrunner , who follow the spacecraft and shoot beams of rays upwards and horizontally; a single beam is harmless, but if the spacecraft is caught in the intersecting area between a horizontal and a vertical beam, a life is lost. In the event of a collision with a mutant, only 1/10 of the vital energy is lost and the mutant is destroyed. Progressing in the game, appear other types of enemies that shoot rockets from the edges.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Terry P.
