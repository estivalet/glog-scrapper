{"altername_name": [], "name": "Poga", "overview": "Part of the part of the \"Red Ribbon Game Pak\". You control Poga, your faithful remote controlled robodroid. Poga's only form of movement is bouncing. You must bounce Poga along his path in his strange mechanical world, avoiding contact with such nasties as spinning nuts and bolts, electromagnetic coils and strange flying robot birds. But all this bouncing strains Poga's mechanical parts, so you must keep him well oiled. You must control him to pick up as many oil cans as possible to increase your score.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jason J.
