{"altername_name": [], "name": "Canonrider", "overview": "A 2D side view, single player platform game by Rainer Weing\u00e4rtner and Ren\u00e9 Udert, published by Ariolasoft in Germany in 1988. Canonrider is an arcade game about exploring a maze while flying on a cannonball. (Note: the game is a bit reminiscent of the story of Baron Munchausen, who traveled the world with a cannonball!) The goal is to escape the maze by finding a cannon and gunpowder that match the cannonball to fill a hole to blast into the wall. A total of eight bags of gunpowder can be found in the maze. There are also a number of other items that you need to use to progress, e.g. B. Water to put out a fire. The ball can float in all directions, slowly sinking down if you don't steer up. However, you can remain in the air at the touch of a button. In the maze there are a number of traps and bugs to avoid. One touch leads to the loss of a life. If you collect enough \"bonus balls\" hanging from the ceiling, you get new lives. There are arrows on some screens. If you lose a life, you start again with the last touched arrow.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Rainer Weing\u00e4rtner", "publishers": "Ariolasoft", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8tKlfBL650", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90273-canonrider\n"}
