{"altername_name": [], "name": "Life (Argus Specialist Publications)", "overview": "A strategy game set in the bizarre world of cellular automata and published in Commodore Disk User 1989/01-02. Life is a mathematical game devised by the Cambridge mathematician John Horton Conway. Following its introduction by Martin Gardner in Scientific American in 1970 it swept the computing world. Having encountered various Basic versions and finding them to be crude, slow and difficult to use I decided to write my own 'deluxe' The rules of Life. In its pure form. Life is played on an infinite grid this is reduced in my version to 40x24. Each grid point can either contain a cell or be empty. The object of the game is to set up an Initial configuration of cells on the grid and then apply Conway's genetic laws' for births, deaths and survivals. These laws were carefully chosen to make the behavior of the population of cells both interesting and unpredictable To understand the rules, note that each grid point is surrounded by eight neighboring points. The rules are: * Survivals. Each cell with two or three neighbors survives. * Deaths. Any cell with four or more neighbors dies of overcrowding. Any cell with one or no neighbors dies of isolation * Births. A new cell will be born in each empty point surrounded by exactly three cells. All births and deaths occur simultaneously and constitute a single generation in the life of a configuration.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "January 9, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "James Kew", "publishers": "Argus Specialist Publications", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/121533-life-argus-specialist-publications\n"}
