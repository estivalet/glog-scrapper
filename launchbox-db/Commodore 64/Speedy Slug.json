{"altername_name": [], "name": "Speedy Slug", "overview": "A good platformer, remarkable graphically, lively, quite nice in the controls and of moderate thickness. A little tenacious but you get used to it. Set in the \"micro world\" of insects, snails and other nice crap, who will return to this habitat for the equally good and colorful \"Sonny the Snail\" and \"Bobix\" (almost all clone between them, conceptually ..). Extraordinary visual impact, fluid scroll and very pleasant to play.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jan Zimmermann", "publishers": "CP Verlag", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-r0Jh2ZWjw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/129506-speedy-slug\n"}
