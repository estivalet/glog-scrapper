{"altername_name": [], "name": "Die Dunkle Dimension", "overview": "Dunkle is a German Ultima IV clone, and unlike the author of most clones, the developer here did a good job retaining most of what makes Ultima IV so special, including the keyword-based dialogue system, the sense of exploring a large world, and the tactical combat screen. It lacks the virtue system, of course, and you control only one party member throughout the game. Still, it's a better clone than most and all in German.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hendrik Belitz", "publishers": "German Design Group (GDG)", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jhlXt6LvQc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/116824-die-dunkle-dimension\n"}
