{"altername_name": [], "name": "Steel Heros", "overview": "A 2-player only duelling tank game published in Magic Disk 64 1994/08. Games that can be played in pairs are still the big hit on the c64. Steel Heroes can only and exclusively be played with another human player, which is certainly beneficial for the fun of the game. You can fight to your heart's content on a playing field that takes up about two thirds of the screen. There are two discarded tanks available that can be controlled with the joysticks in port # 1 (player 1) and port # 2 (player 2). If the power of a player or Panzers has dropped to zero, the game is over and the winner may even be able to add himself to the high score list. P. S.: Tip! Always hide behind the ruins and wait for your chance!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Frank Balk", "publishers": "CP Verlag", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk29rhh5OOU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/130576-steel-heros\n"}
