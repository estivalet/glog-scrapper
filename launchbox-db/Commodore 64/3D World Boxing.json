{"altername_name": ["Boxing Champion"], "name": "3D World Boxing", "overview": "In this boxing game you can choose from dozens of boxers with different attributes in skill areas such as Power, Defence and Punishment. You can play a single match or an entire championship. Each match is presented by an announcer and a good looking girl, as in real matches. The boxers are represented with realistic graphics for the epoch as large on-screen characters. Realistic scoring is awarded for each round. There is only one type of punch available, although a 3D ring view results in realistic movement, and head-lock situations can occur.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Simulmondo", "publishers": "Simulmondo", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90021-3d-world-boxing\n"}
