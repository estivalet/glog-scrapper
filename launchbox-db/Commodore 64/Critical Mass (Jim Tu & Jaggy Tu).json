{"altername_name": [], "name": "Critical Mass (Jim Tu & Jaggy Tu)", "overview": "Critical Mass is a two player only public domain board game for the Commodore 64. It was developed by Jim Tu and Jaggy Tu. The year of release is currently unknown. Game description: Critical Mass is a two player board game based on a little known board game called Explosion. You are presented with a 6x6 grid. Each player in turn places one of his counters (either an 0 or an X) into an empty square, or a square already occupied by one or more of his OWN counters. However, each square has a point at which critical mass is reached and fission occurs. Corner squares explode when two counters are on them, side squares explode when containing three counters, and central squares go up when four counters occupy their space. When an explosion occurs, the counters on the exploding square are distributed into the adjacent squares. Any enemy counters on the latter squares are captured and become counters belonging to the mover. Should receiving squares attain critical mass, further explosions will result. The player having no counters left at the end of his opponent's move is the loser.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jaggy Tu", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/156367-critical-mass-jim-tu-jaggy-tu\n"}
