{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dungeon Trials", "overview": "Published in COMPUTE!'s Gazette 1991/07, an insert in Compute Magazine. You and your allies have been accused of murdering the king of Arcacia. Due to uncertainty about your guilt among the High Council judges, you and your party have been locked in a maze filled with magical doors and powerful demons. Legend has it that the gods of the underworld will determine who is guilty and who is not. Here is where you will be tested. Those who are untruthful have their fates sealed from the beginning. It will only be a matter of time before it's apparent who among your party is innocent and who is guilty. Those who escape the dungeon trials alive will be excused of all charges, and their names will be cleared.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bryan Christ", "publishers": "COMPUTE!
