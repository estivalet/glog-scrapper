{"altername_name": [], "name": "Chang's Adventure", "overview": "Inspired by the original Firebird game from 1985, Chang's Adventure lets you play as Chang one more time. Chang must flee from The Unknown Island. To do this, he must make his way to the harbour where his trusty boat awaits. However, things are not so simple. The way to the harbour is blocked by a locked gate. Chang must win the key to the gate from the Temple Warlord. But first he must find the key to the locked temple... Chang's Adventure has the very same kind of gameplay as the original Willow Pattern did. You must kill or avoid the ninjas, and you need to use the swords strategically in order not to waste them. Winning the game should be a doable task, but achieving a score of full 100 % along the way might be quite a bit trickier.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2011", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Joonas Lindberg", "publishers": "Mad Productions", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75427-changs-adventure\n"}
