{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cybotron", "overview": "Over the years since the first design was announced in 2001, robots with the ability to think have increased with their intelligence growing at a fast rate. Humans over the years now rely on the robots to do all their tasks and thus have become lazy, and finally the manufacture of the robots was left to the robots to make themselves. The robots have now come to the conclusion that there is no place for the humans and have decided to squash them all and so Trons, Brains, Armedroids, Pulsars, Enforcer Droids and Electrodes are running amok killing all the humans they find. Cybotron is a single screen shooter viewed from a high elevated angle and is inspired by the arcade game Robotron 2084 where you must destroy all robots on the screen to move to the next level. If you touch any robot then you lose one of three lives but you are armed with a laser. Two joysticks can be selected with one controlling your movements while the other joystick controls your fire direction. Humans also wander around the screen and these can be collected for bonus points.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Darrell Etherington", "publishers": "Anirog Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/95438-cybotron\n"}
