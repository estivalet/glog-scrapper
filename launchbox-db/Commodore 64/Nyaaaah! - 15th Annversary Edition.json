{"altername_name": [], "name": "Nyaaaah!: 15th Annversary Edition", "overview": "Back in 1995 Richard Bayliss wrote the first ever Nyaaaah! game. A good 15 years later a new Nyaaaah! game is born. It is a mix up of a shoot 'em up and also a lick 'em up as well. It depends on the colour bottles that you pick up. The game starts, where Snodge has to lick the enemies, but after he collects bottles of magic potion, (depending on the coloured potion he drinks) he will end up with a new weapon. Either a mini bolt, mega bolt or default licking. To mark the 15th anniversary of Nyaaaah! Richard decided to carefully design and create this game, using the sideways SEUCK and then really push the SEUCK to its own limit.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2010", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Chris Yates", "publishers": "The New Dimension (TND)", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdD_0jCuFcI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75988-nyaaaah-15th-annversary-edition\n"}
