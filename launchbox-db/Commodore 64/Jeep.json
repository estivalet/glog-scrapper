{"altername_name": [], "name": "Jeep", "overview": "Jeep is an arcade action game similar to Moon Patrol. You are in command of lunar jeep and need to patrol 900 kilometers of very damaged lunar surface; in fact you will need to jump over boulders and crevices, and destroy large rocks and other obstacles on your way. Time is limited so you should accelerate your jeep and act quickly. You have 999 units of time to achieve the highest score. Also two kinds of UFOs are trying to attack you. Purple ones are launching bombs and Green ones are dropping mines which will explode with the slightest contact with your jeep. The game is shown in a 2D scrolling view, where you should control your jeep, accelerating/decelerating its speed, jumping, and shooting in horizontal and vertical planes. Contact with pits decreases your speed while contact with other obstacles, enemies, or their weapons will eliminate your jeep. There are several difficulty levels and best scores will be written in the Hi-Scores table.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Carlo Perconti", "publishers": "Loriciels", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWmG0P36TR8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/107185-jeep\n"}
