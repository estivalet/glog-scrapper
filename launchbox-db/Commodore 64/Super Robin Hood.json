{"altername_name": [], "name": "Super Robin Hood", "overview": "The Sheriff of Nottingham has kidnapped Maid Marian and locked her in the East Tower. He will only release her when the outlaw Robin Hood surrenders to him. Gallantly, Robin sets out through Sherwood Forest to Nottingham Castle to free his love, oblivious to the inevitable dangers that lie before him. Once he has crossed the moat and entered the castle the game begins; he must fight his way past the guards and mediaeval animals protecting the castle. Only by fast reflexes and accurate manouevring do you stand a chance of rescuing Maid Marian. You will need skill and quick reflexes to survive in the dangerous castle complex. Watch out for the guards who shoot bolts at you with their crossbows; you can duck or jump to avoid them, or even run away. If you get hit you will lose vital HEALTH points. These start at 99 and if they fall below 00 you are a dead man! There are tablets lying around which will increase your HEALTH points if you can get them. You must collect the hearts around the castle and then go to the East Tower to save Maid Marian. However, to make progress through the castle you have to get the keys needed to operate the mechanical medieval lifts which elevate you to different sections of the castle.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Delvin Sorrell", "publishers": "Codemasters Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyzERUDpXjE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/95483-super-robin-hood\n"}
