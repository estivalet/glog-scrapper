{"altername_name": [], "name": "Space Comets", "overview": "A space shooter published in Computronic 1984/05. You steer a spaceship through a swarm of meteorites. Any collision with the meteorites is deadly, but you can defend yourself. The meteorites are rendered harmless by skillfully dodging and firing shots. However, several hits are necessary to shoot down the dangerous celestial bodies. Your score is displayed on the bottom left of the screen and your high score is displayed on the bottom right. In the middle you can see how much longer you have to fly. Whenever the time reaches a multiple of 1000 (e.g. 3000, 4000 etc.), the level increases and the game becomes more difficult. Depending on how fast you fly, you constantly get points for the distance traveled. If you hit a meteorite, you get 2 points for it. Destroy it completely, get 10 points. The game allows numerous variants. It's a lot of fun when you try to master the game without shooting.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "February 3, 1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Peter Menke", "publishers": "Tronic Verlag GmbH", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4HOCLtLXoI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/130696-space-comets\n"}
