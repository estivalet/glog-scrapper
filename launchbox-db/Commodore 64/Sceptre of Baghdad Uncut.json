{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sceptre of Baghdad Uncut", "overview": "Published in Commodore Zone Issue #03 (January/February 1996). You're Caliph - king of Iraq. An evil wizard from distant land broke into your palace, transforming it into a maze of traps and puzzles, and taking the sacred Sceptre of Bagdad. Unless you can recover it, your spell as ruler is finished. Featuring lots of enemies to dodge, platform-style jumps and object manipulation, the game resembles the Dizzy games, with a Jet Set Willy-influenced setting. There are many objects you need to use, but you can only carry two at a time. You have three lives with which to complete the game and this is the full game without any subtractions.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jonathan Wells", "publishers": "Binary Zone PD", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sceptre_of_Bagdad", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHClBlZ-ZsU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/126615-sceptre-of-baghdad-uncut\n"}
