{"altername_name": [], "name": "3D Construction Kit", "overview": "This package allows users to create their own 3D worlds, using technology related to the Freescape universe seen in games such as Castle Master and Driller / Space Station Oblivion. Pull-down menus allow objects to be created and positioned, with movement loops and simple animation defined. A network of rooms can be created. A simple BASIC-style language is integrated to allow puzzles and conditions (open a door when a key in placed into it, for example). You can also include enemies which must be shot. At any moment you can enter the gameworld to test it.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Incentive Software", "publishers": "Domark Software", "genres": "Sandbox", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.94", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_Construction_Kit", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-cL0wqPMlg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86438-3d-construction-kit\n"}
