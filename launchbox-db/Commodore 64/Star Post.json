{"altername_name": [], "name": "Star Post", "overview": "You are the lone defender of a starshlp outpost in a remote sector ot our galaxy. Three-dimensional invaders tumble and plunge toward the outpost attempting to destroy you. Your mission is to defend the base against the invaders as they attack from 8 channels on both sides of the Star Post. You must also defend against a Superalien which disrupts your viewscreen as It spirals its way toward your Star Post. There are 3 different game versions: Beginner, Advanced and Hyper. You must maneuver your laser cannon in a circular or back-and- forth motion while firing on aliens. In addition, your out- post is equipped with a special SuperZap laser which eliminates all aliens currently on your viewscreen. Super- Zap are added at the rate of 1 per level, and unused Zaps are stored for later use. Your Star Post can withstand only 7 alien hits per level of play. Each new level resets the number of hits to 0, but 8 hits in any one round destroys your Star Post. This game was originally made for the Commodore VIC-20 in 1982, and was eventually ported over to the C64 the following year.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Clifford Ramshaw", "publishers": "Commodore Business Machines", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8jOqz37yOw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/112981-star-post\n"}
