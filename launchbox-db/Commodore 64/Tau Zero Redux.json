{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tau Zero Redux", "overview": "Alf Yngve's classic Public Domain SEUCK game gets the SEUCK Redux treatment. This is a neat classic game from 1992, and features extra enhancements. Such as the enemy aiming for the player when shooting. Also the removal of the SEUCK slowdown syndrome (Since a lean and mean sprite multiplexor has been implemented in the source). I also added a little routine which will make the water background flow, by a simple delayed scrolling char routine. The game doesn't consist of power ups, but there's some good gameplay elements added to it. Hope you enjoy this classic futuristic blaster.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2014", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Alf Yngve", "publishers": "The New Dimension (TND)", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/223855-tau-zero-redux\n"}
