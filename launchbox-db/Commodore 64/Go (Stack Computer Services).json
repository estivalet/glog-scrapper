{"altername_name": [], "name": "Go (Stack Computer Services)", "overview": "Go is a computer version of the board game which is played on a 13 x 11 grid between two players and the idea is to place counters on the corners of the squares to have the most counters when the board is filled. Each player can place a counter anywhere and to remove an opponent's counter they have to surround it fully with their counters. Once the board is filled then the winner is the player with the most counters.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Unknown", "publishers": "Stack Computer Services", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75877-go-stack-computer-services\n"}
