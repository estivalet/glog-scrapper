{"altername_name": [], "name": "Piracy (Ace Games)", "overview": "Piracy is a neat, aesthetically stylish pseudo-board game, based upon the checkers concept. However, it definitely has some novel differences which make for an entertaining experience. One of these is the 17th Century naval setting, with the opposing galleons of Black Pete the pirate, versus Captain Carlos of the Spanish Armada. Each opposing ship has 15 troops (checkers) laying in wait in the cannon bays, ready to pounce out onto the \"game board\". Each of the five cannons bays has three troops. You have the option to play as Captain Carlos or Black Pete.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Clive Barrett", "publishers": "Ace Games", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.32", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/k1NRnpwd0tg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/96104-piracy-ace-games\n"}
