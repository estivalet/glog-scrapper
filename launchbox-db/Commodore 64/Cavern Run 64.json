{"altername_name": ["Cavern Run"], "name": "Cavern Run 64", "overview": "In Cavern Run 64 you move a spacecraft viewed from the side, left or right as it falls down a constantly scrolling cavern and you must avoid hitting the walls or it is game over. Before you play you can select your fuel level and this decreases, which is shown on the right of the screen, but there are fuel capsules that can be collected to increase your levels. Once you crash then you are told your distance traveled before you play again to beat your last score.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "The Computer Room", "publishers": "Bubble Bus Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=aC_LGQdPS6Q", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90399-cavern-run-64\n"}
