{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cube of Eleusis", "overview": "A puzzle game created by Tim Hartnell & Brett Hale and published in 1984 in the book \"The Big Fat Book of Commodore 64 Games\". A religious cult, the Eleusian Mysteries, flourished around Eleusis in ancient Greece. It sprang from an agrarian fertility cult which originated around 600BC. Initiation into the cult required the newcomer to undergo a series of trials. In this program, we re-enact one such trial, in which the neophyte's mental ability is tested. You are handed a cube, fashioned of a clear, amber-Like solid. You are told that the cube contains three gems which are invisible to the naked eye. You have to concentrate your mental energy beam on a particular part of the cube, and then deduce - if your mental energy beam emerges or not from the opposite side - where the three gems are located. You are told how many mental energy rays you have left, and are asked to say which face of the cube you will concentrate on (entering a four if you think where the gems are Located). The player continues, entering beams until he or she is confident regarding the gems' locations. If all goes well you will have the skills to enter into the mystery yourself!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Brett Hale", "publishers": "Interface Publications", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/166131-cube-of-eleusis\n"}
