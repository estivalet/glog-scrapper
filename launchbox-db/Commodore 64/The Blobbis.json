{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Blobbis", "overview": "Published in the book \"Arcade Games for the Commodore 64\", this game published in 1985 was created by Frank Mikulastik, In it, you need to break through the force field that protects three evil Blobbis. Equipped with the latest and most fashionable fighting tuxedo and shooting hat, you are out to break through the force field that protects three evil Blobbis. The force field has five levels, and each shot from your top hat will destroy a section of one level. The different force fields move in opposite directions, so when you shoot through one and create a hole in the next one, the two holes will soon rift apart. Opening up a hole through all five levels just as a Blobbis passes over requires clever strategy! Each Blobbis has a different method of preventing you from penetrating the force field. The most dangerous is the Hunchback Blobbis, who drops a deadly pulsar from the center of the screen on each trip across the screen. If it hits you, it's all over! The Bug-eyed Blobbis frustrates you by rebuilding the top two layers of the force field on each trip. And the Flashing Blobbis makes a confusing and hypnotizing display. Hitting any one of the Blobbis will win the game for you. As your strategy improves, you should be able to do it with fewer shots. Use the joystick to move the player sprite, and press the fire button to fire your hat.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "FanFare House", "publishers": "CBS College Publishing", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/88621-the-blobbis\n"}
