{"altername_name": [], "name": "Another Day, Another Zombie", "overview": "Released in Commodore Free #080. This is a score/attack game in which you must survive as long as you can against wave after wave of the advancing undead. You (and a pistol) are the only thing between a horde of flesh-eating zombies and your camp of a dozen survivors. If any of the walking corpses make it into the camp, all Hell will break loose \u2013 and its \u201cGame Over\u201d (if you're dead, that is). You can't afford to let one of those zombies get past you. You can only fire a couple of rounds before you have to re-load, so use your bullets sparingly, as a wasted shot can mean certain death. The faster you cut through the horde, the more points you will acquire as more dangerous zombies (such as sitters which have a highly toxic ranged attack, or boomers that will explode) appear, splattering corrosive bile around its proximity. Also, a zombie combo bonus is awarded for taking out a huge wave of zombies in succession. How long can you hold back the creeping doom?", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2014", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Carl Mason", "publishers": "Commodore Free", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75478-another-day-another-zombie\n"}
