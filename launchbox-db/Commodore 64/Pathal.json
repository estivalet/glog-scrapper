{"altername_name": ["Brainbox"], "name": "Pathal", "overview": "A Tetris style game created by J\u00fcrgen Graser and released as part of Magic Disk 64 1989/06, and Game On 1990/11. It was also part of the Italian Videoteca Computer n.8 compilation under the name of Brainbox. What is PATHAL about? Different-shaped parts fall into a U-shaped pit, which must be placed as space-saving as possible. By pressing the fire button, the descending piece can be rotated to determine the optimal position. Accompanied by great music, this admittedly rather easy-sounding assignment is slowly but surely turning into true hysteria. For professionals there is a built-in option that varies the speed of fall of the pieces sailing down. The speed of fall can be increased or decreased with F5 or F7.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "J\u00fcrgen Graser", "publishers": "CP Verlag", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0zTXUJTnU4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/76035-pathal\n"}
