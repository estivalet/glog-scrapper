{"altername_name": ["Darth Vader: Adventure"], "name": "Dog Star Adventure", "overview": "Dog Star Adventure is a text adventure game inspired by Star Wars. In the commercial TRS-80 release all references to Star Wars have been changed. Princess Leia has changed to Leya, Darth Vader to General Doom, Stormtroopers to Roche Soldiers, the Rebel Alliance to Forces of Freedom, etc. In the Commodore PET conversion, most (but not all) references have been restored to their Star Wars inspirations. In the game Leia (or Leya) is captured by the Empire. She is now stuck on Darth Vader's battlecruiser. It's up to the player, taking the role of a robot, to restore the Millennium Falcon to working condition and rescue the princess. This happens in typical text-adventure style. The player can move in various directions and with each step the locale the player is in is described. The player has an inventory and can use items. The player must look out for Stormtroopers while exploring the battlecruiser.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1980", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "David Malmberg", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/95913-dog-star-adventure\n"}
