{"altername_name": ["Ultima IV: Quest of the Avatar Remastered", "Ultima 4 Remastered"], "name": "Ultima IV: Remastered", "overview": "A further improvement from Ultima IV Gold. A massive update to the game including a graphics overhaul and sped up dungeon renderer, a text overhaul including use of mixed case, many dialog bugs fixed, new game features like quite and save in dungeons, joystick control, bug fixes and other technical enhancements for faster loads, and play without disk swapping. Instead of building up a character by any means possible in order to face a villain in the end of the game, in Ultima IV the player is trying to become the Avatar, a role model for people. This means upholding the Eight Virtues, basically trying to become a better person. Making morally conscious decisions and helping other people is not done expecting a material reward, but because it is the actual goal of the game and the main focus of its gameplay. The game frowns on behavior typical of most other RPGs, such as backstabbing fleeing enemies or picking up everything that isn't nailed down even if it does not belong to the protagonist. This different approach established the game's reputation as the first \"true\" Ultima, influencing the design philosophy of later installments and the overall spirit of the series.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "March 28, 2015", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Chuck Bueche", "publishers": "", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/131890-ultima-iv-remastered\n"}
