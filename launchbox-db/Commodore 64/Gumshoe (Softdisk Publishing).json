Moorman. Ms. Glitznitz has been killed and the usual suspects have been rounded up. Can you and your friends solve these logical mysteries? With each game you can choose up to 25 suspects in a murder mystery. You get to select which clues you think will be most valuable as you piece together the evidence. To make things difficult, the clues given by the perpetrator are outright lies! Each player has a limited amount of points and points are expended with each guess and can only be replenished by guessing correctly. When your points are gone, you are out of the game.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "David M.
