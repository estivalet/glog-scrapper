{"altername_name": ["Starslayer"], "name": "Star Slayer", "overview": "You are Star Slayer, a hard-lad bounty hunter. You like a good laugh as long as it involves killing a lot of pirate vermin. Good news for you then, that you have been chosen by the Galactic Federation to clean up a number of Star Colonies that have been taken over by the scum. Not only have you got to teleport between each colony, but you have to collect teleport activation units and get enough bounty to do so. The GalFed have kindly teleported you to the first, with your trusty companion Stardroid, so it's up to you and him to get through to the next colony.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jason Kendall", "publishers": "Silverbird Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9MhmAfxmT0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/112877-star-slayer\n"}
