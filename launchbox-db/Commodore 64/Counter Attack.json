{"altername_name": [], "name": "Counter Attack", "overview": "Counter Attack is inspired by the board game Connect 4 where two players take it in turns to place a counter in one of seven columns on an upright grid to make a row or force the other player to make a row vertical, horizontal or diagonal. Before the game starts there are two options that can be selected, how many counters to make a row, and if the winner is the first player to make the row or to force the other player to make one. As the game progresses placing counters, each player has a choice, either place a counter or rotate a row or column one place, left, right, up or down.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tony Wright", "publishers": "OIC", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/94141-counter-attack\n"}
