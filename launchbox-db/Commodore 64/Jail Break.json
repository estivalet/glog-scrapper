{"altername_name": ["Jailbreak"], "name": "Jail Break", "overview": "\"The warden has been taken hostage. Free him, no matter what the cost.\" As a policeman, the object of the game is to fire on escaped convicts who have taken the warden hostage, and in order to do this, you must make your way through downtown streets, a park, a bridge, and eventually, a prison. By rescuing hostages along the way, you can obtain a number of weapons, such as a pistol and a tear gas gun, and you can select them by using the weapons select area at the bottom of the screen. Be careful: If you shoot any hostages, you will lose whatever weapons that you have.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Darrell Etherington", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "0.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6yZRv0Izbw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40297-jail-break\n"}
