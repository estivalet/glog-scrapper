{"altername_name": [], "name": "Speedy Delivery", "overview": "Published in Loadstar #076, this Christmas themed puzzle game . You need to deliver presents to all the houses but time is of the essence so you must make moves that take you ONLY to houses without presents, crossing forests if necessary, until all the houses have presents. Each move must take you to the next house in order to deliver the festive yule gifts. Any move that takes you out of the playing area or to a house that already has gifts will cause you to lose the game.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Litag", "publishers": "Learning Technologies", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/76088-speedy-delivery\n"}
