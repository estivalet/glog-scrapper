{"altername_name": [], "name": "Zulu", "overview": "In this flick-screen maze game, you play as Wyatt Hunter who has travelled back in time to a Zulu tribal area to collect 100 Golden Masks before the clock runs out and he is transported back to his own time. Scattered over the maze are the masks as well as Zulu warriors who roam around the maze and if touched you will lose one of three lives. Holding down the fire button will initiate your shield and make the any Zulu who touches you disappear. The shield count decreases but when not in use increases. Other objects to be wary off are cauldrons which when touched make the walls invisible and the only way to make them appear is to collect another mask. Touch another cauldron and you lose a life. If a spider appears then this must be collected as the time decreases even faster until collected. The joystick or keyboard is used to control Wyatt.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "John Mitchell", "publishers": "Firebird Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJ59FoD_e2s", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106201-zulu\n"}
