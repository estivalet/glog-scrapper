{"altername_name": [], "name": "Grime 6502", "overview": "Grime is an old DOS game I used to have on my PC XT... it was a simple little text game, that was a lot of fun! Grime was written by Mark Elendt... as far as I remember I got it from an old magazine coverdisk... currently Grime is 'abandonware'... no one seems to really remember it, and it's trickyto get working on a modern pc, as it runs too fast!!.. At the start of July 2018, I started a 7 day programming project to recreate 'Grime' as a Z80 based game... I chose it because it's fun and simple, and this gave me a good opportunity... I wasn't just going to remake Grime... I was going to make it work on 11 different systems! I remade grime as 'Grime Z80' which uses one piece of logic code that plays on 11 different Z80 systems... namely: Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum,MSX1, MSX2, Enterprise, Sam Coupe, TI-83 calculator, Gameboy, Gameboy Color, Sega Mastersystem and Sega Gamegear! But why stop there... I now had a simple game 'template' which could be extended for something new... why just limit it to the Z80? so in December 2018 I started the project again... this time as Grime 6502", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2019", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Keith S.", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/160288-grime-6502\n"}
