{"altername_name": [], "name": "Super Nova", "overview": "Super Nova is a home-brew space shooter game for the Commodore 64. It loosely pays homage to the old Atari classics Starmaster and Star Raiders. Your star system is attacked by six enemy battlestars that try to reach and destroy the sun. Your mission is to stop them! The status display shows either your enemy the condition of the sun. When it turns from yellow to red, then the nova is not far. Press M to open the map. This only possible if no enemy is in range. You can only fly to one of the next sectors to your current position.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2020", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Peter Otto", "publishers": "", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/170135-super-nova\n"}
