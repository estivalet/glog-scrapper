{"altername_name": [], "name": "Stoppt Den Calippo Fresser", "overview": "A horizontally-scrolling shoot'em up for one player created by Michael Beier, Michael Martin Detert and Thomas Detert and published in both 64'er 1992/08, and in Game On 1992/07. Stoppt den Calippo Fresser (German: Stop the Calippo eater) is a mix of obstacle courses and simple puzzles. The game was paid by Langnese to advertise their Calippo freeze pops, introduced seven years earlier. Somewhere in the Caribbean, on small Calippo-Island, crisis is imminent: The bad Calippo-eater is hoarding all the fruity fresh Calippos. As the chosen hero of the game, C.C.Cool, only you can stop him. There's no violence, but your energy is drained by obstacles (even clouds) and directly emptied by animals, replenished by the occasional floating Calippo and every 30000 points.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Michael Beier", "publishers": "Langnese", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/166867-stoppt-den-calippo-fresser\n"}
