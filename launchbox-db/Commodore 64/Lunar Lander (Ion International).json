{"altername_name": [], "name": "Lunar Lander (Ion International)", "overview": "You control a lunar module attempting to successfully land on the moon's surface. Alternately, lower a capsule to a crash-free landing. Whatever it takes to get the points. In the First level, you must touch down on one of the landing pads in the mountains. You have the choice of landing at either the 500 point pad or the 100 point pad. Once you have landed at both pads, however, the 100 point pad disappears, leaving a pit in its place. The second level is reached by navigating the Lander down into the pit. In this level, your goal is to land at the 1000 point pad in the cave \u2014 a task as hard as it looks. You can control the lander with either a joystick or keyboard.
