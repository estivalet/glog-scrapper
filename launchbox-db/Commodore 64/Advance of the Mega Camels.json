{"altername_name": ["Attack of the Mutant Camels (Europe)"], "name": "Advance of the Mega Camels", "overview": "In this game you fly in your spaceship and shoot at gigantic mutant camels who are trying to attack your base. The gameplay is side-scrolling but with a difference in that you can turn round and fly left or right and you control the jet speed. The camels start off yellow but as you bombard them with laser fire they change colour until they are eventually destroyed. There is no hanging about however as the camels are stampeding towards your base and they must be stopped quickly. The game was re-named to Advance of the Mega Camels in North America due to the original VIC-20 version of Matrix (the sequel to the original Gridrunner) being renamed to Gridrunner II: Attack of the Mutant Camels in the region to avoid any confusion. This was also one of the few Llamasoft games that was actually published in North America by Llamasoft themselves and not through a third party such as HES.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "July 15, 1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jeff Minter", "publishers": "LLamasoft", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.33", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_of_the_Mutant_Camels", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybzUgiE_vQM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78019-advance-of-the-mega-camels\n"}
