{"altername_name": ["Hyperspace Warrior"], "name": "Hyper Space Warrior", "overview": "Hyper Space Warrior is a side scrolling shooter developed by Emmanuel Fontaigo of Legendary Designs and published and released in 1995. It was released as part of Loadstar #127. A wild, side-scrolling space shoot-em-up. Avoid everything that moves and shoots. Pick up anything that looks valuable. Blast everything but NOT blindly. Shoot the shimmering attack vessels when they are close enough to snatch its payload, which will increase your weapon power. Accumulate power early so you can survive the later rounds. Time your travels through force field doors, if you don't you're toast. Star fields will allow you to reverse direction.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Emmanuel Fontaigo", "publishers": "Softdisk Publishing", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxK3tI4v-Nk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151439-hyper-space-warrior\n"}
