{"altername_name": [], "name": "Neutmare", "overview": "Published in Magic Disk 64 1988/09. Neutmare is a pong style game for head-to-head play for 1 or 2 players. Perhaps you can still remember the first video games and the 'tennis' game module that was so popular at the time. 'Neutmare' is a beefed up version of this popular game. Above all, the great music that plays in the background makes playing a real pleasure. After loading, you have two options: You can either play against the wall alone, or you can start with two people. Should you prefer to play alone, you will have to score a certain number of points in each line-up until you advance to the next level. In TWO-PLAYER mode, the winner is the one who is the first to score 15 points.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "RGB-Soft", "publishers": "CP Verlag", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/122928-neutmare\n"}
