{"altername_name": [], "name": "U.F.O.", "overview": "U.F.O. is a single player variation on the Space Invaders genre. The player controls a fighter aircraft, a U.S.A.F. F21 Codor, the only plane that is capable of defending the Earth against an alien onslaught. The player has only four of these planes / lives with which to complete the game. The plane can be moved left and right as well as, to a limited degree, up and down. The F21 Condor has a gun with which the player must shoot alien ships that are attacking Earth. However, this gun will overheat and jam if used too much so on the right of the game screen is a temperature gauge that the player must monitor. When all enemy ships have been cleared from a level the player must fly their ship to the next level through a hypersonic air corridor to the next combat zone. Here, against a flashing background, the player must keep their craft within the bounds of the corridor as it gently winds its way to the horizon. After a successful transit the player can spend credits that have been earned on either their shields or their energy before entering the next phase of combat.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Odin Computer Graphics", "publishers": "Firebird Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6zq_XK9agg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/96916-ufo\n"}
