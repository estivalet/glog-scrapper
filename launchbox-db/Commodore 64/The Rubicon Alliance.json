{"altername_name": ["Starfox"], "name": "The Rubicon Alliance", "overview": "Save the Rubicon, the anti-matter zone that was made by the alliance of the eight planets to avoid war. But in 2746 a new hostile race, the Space Thugs enters and you must use your Starfox fighter to save us all. The action is viewed from the cockpit of your starfighter, which is equipped with lasers and side/rear-view mirrors. It also has a status log detailing your weapons and current threats, and an advanced 3-dimensional navigation system called the Holocube. Controlled from a separate screen, the Holocube allows you to rotate a 3D image of space and plot the co-ordinates of your journey. The player must manually navigate through wormholes for fast travel - contact with the edges drains your shield. Electrical and ion storms are a constant hazard - the easiest way to avoid these is to use the general log to note their co-ordinates. Weapons can be upgraded.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Christoph Schulte-Vennbur", "publishers": "Ariolasoft", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnpC1JNd1tM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109906-the-rubicon-alliance\n"}
