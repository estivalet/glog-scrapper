{"altername_name": ["Bubble Busters"], "name": "Bubble Burst", "overview": "Any child 4 to 8 years old will enjoy this program. Children enter Soapie the Sea Serpent's colorful fantasy world, where they maneuver soap bubbles to catch Zeboingers. Like many other action games, BUBBLE BURST provides a non-violent learning experience. Prediction is one of the learning skills that children develope in helping Soapie. As children watch the flight patterns of Zeboingers and move the target bubble, they can learn to predict where the bubble and Zeboinger will intersect. As children contine to play the game, they also beging to recognize that Zeboingers fly in specific patters. Using these pattern recognition skills, children can predict more accurately when to launch a bubble. At more advanced levels of play, BUBBLE BURST encourages children to plan strategies to outwit the Zeboingers. Children need to consider a number of variables: the flight path of the launched bubble as well as the patterns and speeds of the Zeboingers. Whether your child is a beginner or moder advanced player, BUBBLE BURST will provide hours of fun and learning.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Joyce Hakansson Associates", "publishers": "Spinnaker Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.12", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzVB8841H6U", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90103-bubble-burst\n"}
