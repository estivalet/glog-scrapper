{"altername_name": ["Spacebike Simulator", "Space Bike Simulator"], "name": "Spacebike", "overview": "The meanest, best looking shooting match yet on the Commodore 64. Climb onto your GTX Armored bike and kick start her into life. If you're after action, you've come to the right place and you're sure gonna get plenty! Twist and turn through level after level of stunning interactive graphics, blasting your way through some of the ugliest aliens ever, and just watch those old temples crumble as you pump 'em with plasma bolts. You'll need all the weapons you can get to cope with the Guardian at the end of each level - and if it's pure firepower you want, you won't be disappointed 'cos there's plenty to choose from. You just need to collect all the coins dropped by the slime you wasted along the way.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Impressions", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tyE8yCCX0Q", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/112630-spacebike\n"}
