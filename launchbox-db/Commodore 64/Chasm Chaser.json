{"altername_name": [], "name": "Chasm Chaser", "overview": "Guide your blue blob around the chasm to meet the pink blob. If you bump into the chasm, or any other background (or the evil wizard), you will end up at the start of the screen again. The game ends when you have managed to get to the other side of the chasm and kiss the pink blob. There is no time limit, no lives, etc. This is Joshua's first ever ML programmed game, so please don't take this game too seriously.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2010", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Joshua Green", "publishers": "The New Dimension (TND)", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1sZ4UdjOcOg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75428-chasm-chaser\n"}
