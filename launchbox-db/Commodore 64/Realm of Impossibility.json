{"altername_name": [], "name": "Realm of Impossibility", "overview": "The game is a dungeon crawl in which the player can traverse through 13 dungeons of various complexity in order to gather seven crowns to defeat the evil cleric \"Wistrik\". Each dungeon comprises up to a dozen separate rooms, with the game moving from one to another when the player moves onto a number of defined door areas. The player had to navigate through the rooms to find the treasure, either a crown or a key that provided access to a formerly locked dungeon. They then had to retrace their steps to exit the dungeon. The rooms normally contained zombies, snakes, spiders and other various beasts. The game's enemies could not be killed, but were generally stupid, simply running directly at the player. Careful timing and positioning could trap them in locations where they could no longer reach you. The player could also drop crosses by pressing the joystick fire button. These acted as obstacles to the monsters, and were dropped in opportune locations to block pursuit. The player could drop up to a dozen of these in their wake and they would disappear slowly over time, allowing the pursuit to continue.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "January 1, 1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "BRAM Inc.", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realm_of_Impossibility", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ydsx376ltc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/29873-realm-of-impossibility\n"}
