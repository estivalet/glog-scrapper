{"altername_name": [], "name": "Creepspread II", "overview": "Creepspread II is a sequel to the first game, also from Fran\u00e7ois Blanchette. This game adds a side-scrolling game component to this action game where you jump and avoid the monsters overland, then once in the caves it picks up where the original left off, you adventure through a series of caves populated by monsters of every type. Touching them harms you and if your health drops to zero the game ends. You can increase health by picking up certain items in the dungeon, others will increase your score.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Fran\u00e7ois Blanchette", "publishers": "Monstics Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/94949-creepspread-ii\n"}
