{"altername_name": [], "name": "Star Command", "overview": "You are in command of the starship Interceptor, voyaging on the outskirts of the galaxy. Your mission, to find a planet suitable as a rest home for retired Launchbox Moderators, has been successful, but as you change course to head for home a meteorite shower threatens to destroy your craft. The Interceptor is a modern craft, equipped with sophisticated navigation and weapons system, and protected by the very latest ultratensile shielding, but the meteorite shower is so thick that you must use your phaser blaster to vaporize some of the rocks before they hit the ship. There are two shields to protect the ship, and once these are gone the main hill and the directional control systems are likely to suffer serious damage. If you survive the meteor shower then you have a short time to repair the ship. Allocate repair blocks to different parts of teh ship as you think best. Accurate firing will enable you to maximize the number of repair blocks available. But wait, is that an alien battle fleet up ahead?", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Supersoft", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/114103-star-command\n"}
