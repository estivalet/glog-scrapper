{"altername_name": ["Raid"], "name": "Niobia", "overview": "A horizontally scrolling space shoot'em up created by Robin Lennon and Shaun Morris. Published in Italy as Raid in both New Special PlayGames n.46 (febbraio 1992) and Hit Parade C64 n.67 (Maggio 1992). A new alien threat looms on the horizon of our solar system. To crush this umpteenth invasion, the Federation commissions its most skilled interstellar fighter pilot to disintegrate the mighty enemy army. Having reached the expected rendezvous for our friend, all that remains is to insert the photonic lasers and fight against the endless hordes of aliens that will attack him mercilessly. Your task will be precisely to defend the entire solar system: so be prepared to hit everything that moves, to avoid any contact with other objects and you will see that in the end, victory will smile at you.
