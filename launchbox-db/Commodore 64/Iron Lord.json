{"altername_name": [], "name": "Iron Lord", "overview": "Returning from a long journey, you find your homeland in chaos. Your ancestral castle lays in ruins. An opposing army commanded by your evil uncle is rising up to challenge you. You must talk to your people and raise an army of your own to defend yourself. You can compete in archery competitions, hang out in pubs and fight against evil knights. The swordfighting mechanics were somewhat of a novelty for the time, as they were presented in a first-person perspective. Your enemy was seen through your helmet's view as you engage in battle with your sword. Travelling to different towns and areas allows you to converse with kings, paupers, innkeepers and store owners. An inventory system is available to the player where you can store any items or weapons that your buy or sell.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ordilogic Systems", "publishers": "Ubi Soft Entertainment Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.05", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Lord", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNUb9Q0nokY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40299-iron-lord\n"}
