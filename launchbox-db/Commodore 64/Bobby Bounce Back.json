The game is massive and comes with 70-80 levels in total and with a proper ending screen. The game\u2019s main character looks like Titanic Blinky with a hi-res overlay. It is kind of a Super Seymour style game.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Chris Walsh", "publishers": "Dynamic Developments", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/89058-bobby-bounce-back\n"}
