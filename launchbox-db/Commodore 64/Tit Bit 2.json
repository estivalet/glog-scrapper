Tit Bit 2 is a single-screen platformer that is about opening a door so you can go to the next level. To achieve this, some items have to be collected. The enemies floating around make this plan difficult. The level backgrounds and the successful music repeat themselves after a few levels, but the enemies are getting faster and faster. Tit Bit 2 can only be played alone, unfortunately a two-player mode is not provided.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "September 5, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "S\u00f6ren Kress", "publishers": "CP Verlag", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvGG4PSv4uU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/132973-tit-bit-2\n"}
