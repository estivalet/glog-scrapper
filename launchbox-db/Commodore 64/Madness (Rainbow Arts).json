{"altername_name": [], "name": "Madness (Rainbow Arts)", "overview": "Madness is a platformer that features 30 screen sized levels. The goal of each levels is to reach the exit within the time limit. The catch is, that the exit needs to be activated by lighting all torches that are spread throughout a level. Naturally, there are lots of different obstacles and enemies trying to stop the player. Most enemies follow a set path, however some may chase the player's sprite through the entire stage. As the levels become more complex, it is necessary to work out routes that don't end in a dead end and allow the player to reach the exit in time while still avoiding enemies.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "January 1, 1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Artur Wystub", "publishers": "Rainbow Arts", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75221-madness-rainbow-arts\n"}
