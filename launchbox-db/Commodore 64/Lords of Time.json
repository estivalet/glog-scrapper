{"altername_name": [], "name": "Lords of Time", "overview": "The anonymous hero of the game (controlled by the player) appears to be a computer programmer in contemporary times. At the start of the game the hero is contacted by Father Time who sends the hero on a quest to recover nine treasures in order to defeat the machinations of the evil Time Lords. The game is divided into 9 eras of time (not including the starting section in the hero's living room), such as the 20th century, Ice Age, age of dinosaurs, Dark Ages, future, the Middle Ages, Tudor England and the Roman Empire. Due to the meddling of the Time Lords anachronisms abound, for example cavemen are found living in the same era as dinosaurs. Access to the nine different eras is via a grandfather clock that turns out to be a time machine in disguise. Hopefully you won't become the *master* of time.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ian Buxton", "publishers": "Level 9 Computing", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.7", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lords_of_Time", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/108622-lords-of-time\n"}
