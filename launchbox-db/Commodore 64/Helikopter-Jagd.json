{"altername_name": [], "name": "Helikopter-Jagd", "overview": "In Helikopter-Jagd you fly a helicopter, boarded with a laser gun, over a seascape with small islands. In the sea and on the islands you have to find and rescue people before they die of hunger or drown. Fly close to the people and your heli will drop a ladder to pick them up. Return the people to a safe platform. In the upper screen you receive information about fuel in your tank and stability (you can pick up several people as long as your heli flies staple). Beware of running empty of fuel (pick up yellow oil barrels swimming in the sea), avoid and shoot up opponents in air and on the sea (like gun boats, a starfighter plane, enemy helicopters and a heat-seeking missile).", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Ocean Software Ltd.", "publishers": "QuelleSoft", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-3RTofmYRs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/89247-helikopter-jagd\n"}
