{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bonka", "overview": "Like Cuthbert Goes Digging, Bonka is a clone of Space Panic. With a constantly falling oxygen supply, you must climb the platform and eliminate the electrocuting Meanies. Hack a hole in the ground for the Meanie to fall into, then hack a hole in the meanies, or rather, hack them through the hole so they fall down and die. The game is customisable with four different speeds and between one and nine Meanies on-screen.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "J.
