{"altername_name": ["Terrorista"], "name": "Who Dares Wins (dk'tronics)", "overview": "You are a member of the S.A.S. and you have been sent to an American Embassy to shoot terrorists that are holding hostages. The game is a 1st person shooter with the whole embassy building on the screen. There are a number of windows and terrorists or hostages will slide past the various windows in a different colour top. As the people appear in the windows you are told what colour the terrorists are wearing and these have to be shot by moving a cross-hair and pressing fire. You have only six shots and when these run out then you must move to a cross-hair in the bottom left and shoot it to reload your gun. For every terrorist shot you receive a merit and collect enough before the time runs out and you are promoted. Shoot a hostage though then you are demoted and if you are demoted from Private or let the time run out then it is game over. During the game the colour of the terrorists can also change to a different colour.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kevin A.
