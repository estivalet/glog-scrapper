{"altername_name": ["Quadropoly"], "name": "Monopoly (HC Mein Home-Computer )", "overview": "German version of Monopoly, published by HC - Mein Home-Computer 1984/07. No definite name, called \"Quadropoly\" in the magazine, info in game calls itself Monopoly. The program is based on the well-known board game Monopoly, but adds a few fields and differs from it in some features. It uses German streets instead of the US ones in the Milton Bradley version. The street group Badstrasse, Turmstrasse is extended by the Lindenstrasse and the street group Parkstrasse, Schlo\u00dfallee by the Feldschmiede. There are three control panels; the taxes to the state have been halved (income tax is 2000 marks). Another work is the municipal utility. The factor for owning all three works is 200. This results in a maximum rent of 2000 marks in total. The Commodore 64 conjures up a game board on the screen and simulates it. The event and community fields have been merged. 22 different events are possible. When you go to prison, you have the opportunity to get out with a double. You can go into debt up to a limit of 40,000 marks.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "July 2, 1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Andreas M\u00f6ller", "publishers": "HC - Mein Home-Computer", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "8", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/111957-monopoly-hc-mein-home-computer\n"}
