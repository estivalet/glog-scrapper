{"altername_name": [], "name": "Black Lamp", "overview": "The game is viewed from the side-on perspective typical of platform games. Jack, under the player's control, has to run, jump, climb and shoot his way through the kingdom of Allegoria in search of nine different coloured lamps, while under constant assault by all manner of creatures. Eight of the nine lamps may be found randomly scattered around the kingdom (in locations which change with each new game), but the ninth lamp, the black lamp, is guarded by a dragon which must be defeated before the lamp can be recovered. Each lamp must be returned to one of several lamp racks in the kingdom. As the player can only carry a single lamp at a time, this can mean a lot of traveling back and forth. Once all the lamps have been returned to the rack, the level is complete, and the player advances to the next level. The game takes place across a series of static and scrolling rooms, which are connected by doorways leading into the foreground or background, as well as up down, left and right.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "January 1, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Software Creations", "publishers": "Firebird Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00S-dXYMLHI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27302-black-lamp\n"}
