{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pinball 9", "overview": "This game is particularly simple, as it consists of a pinball game that involves the use of a single button, the space bar. The main purpose consists of shooting the ball so that it goes into all 9 bins (numbered 111 through 999) in only 15 tries. The duration you hold the space bar increases the power at which the ball is ejected into the playing field. Luck plays an important role in this simple recreation of early pinball games.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Edizione Logica 2000", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/124064-pinball-9\n"}
