{"altername_name": [], "name": "Alhambra", "overview": "Alhambra is a solitaire card game which is played using two decks of playing cards. Its unusual feature is akin to that of Crazy Quilt: the cards in the reserve are built either on the foundations or on a waste pile. Rules There are 8 foundation piles. Four of these start with Aces and build up in suit, while the other four start with Kings and build down in suit. There are also 8 reserve piles containing four cards each. The top cards of the reserve piles are available only to be built on the foundation or onto the waste pile if they match the suit and are one rank higher or lower than the top card; there is no building on the reserve. The deck deals out 1 card at a time, and if that card cannot be used, it will go to the waste pile, where it is available to be built onto the foundations. When the stock is exhausted, the waste pile (which by then already includes cards from the reserve) is picked up and turned over to become the new stock. This can be done twice in the entire game. The game finishes soon after the stock is exhausted the third time. The game is won when all cards are built into the foundation The C64 version of the game was developed by Maurice Jones and published by J & F Publishing in their \"8 More\" compilation pack. The year that this game was made is however currently unknown.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Maurice Jones", "publishers": "J & F Publishing, Inc.", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/153712-alhambra\n"}
