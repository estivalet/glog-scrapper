But instead of simulating hydrofoils you can now command a complete fleet of war ships into several missions. These missions are related to political events that were of interest when the first version of the game was released in 1987. As captain of the fleet you can switch between different ships of your fleet and even command helicopters to support your mission.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Lucasfilm Games LLC", "publishers": "Electronic Arts, Inc.", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_Fleet", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEemFoVEcVA&list=PLTznskr2i2rbzXpT1lwnldi0pJ5mLdVqp", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113212-strike-fleet\n"}
