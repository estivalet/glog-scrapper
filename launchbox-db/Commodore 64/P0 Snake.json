{"altername_name": [], "name": "P0 Snake", "overview": "P0 Snake 64K is an enhanced remake of a game that came out in 2014. It features 30 levels that you must negotiate using a very novel one-button control system. P0 SNAKE is a super simple game to play - it requires just one button! Your snake naturally rotates clockwise, holding the fire button rotates it anti-clockwise. Depressing fire for just the right amount of time will allow you to move your snake around the screen - sounds tricky but you will soon master it! The length of your snake increases during play - so be careful not to eat your own tail! Collect an allotted number of dots to complete each level and watch out for obstacles and enemies along the way!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2015", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Antonio Savona", "publishers": "RGCD & Psytronik Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaiVIBiglO8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/115773-p0-snake\n"}
