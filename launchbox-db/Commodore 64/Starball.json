{"altername_name": ["Spaceball"], "name": "Starball", "overview": "Spaceball is a basic Pong variant. The plot is set in 2164 and the planet Utalis was conquered by the Jitter-Bobs. Their only chance for freedom is to beat the invaders in a Spaceball competition. The utilities consist of two paddles which are positioned on the left and right side of the screen; either one or both controlled by human players. Both participants try to hold a ball on the playfield by bouncing it back with their paddle. If a player lets the ball exit, the other receives points. Sometimes objects or yellow balls appear on the playfield: the former cause the ball's direction to change and the latter causes certain effects on the paddle which touched the ball last, e.g. a smaller, faster, bigger or disappearing paddle. The game was also released as Spaceball.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Garisoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "8", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.71", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpe6zMTSLnQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/112978-starball\n"}
