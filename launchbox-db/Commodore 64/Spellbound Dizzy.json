{"altername_name": ["Dizzy V"], "name": "Spellbound Dizzy", "overview": "Dizzy's been visiting his local friendly Wizard Theo. Now Theo, who may be a dab hand in the waving of wands area, is not much cop at the filing-things-away-neatly department, and he's left his Book of Really Powerful Spells lying round in his laboratory. What's more, the book's been left open at the page headed A Really, Really, Powerful Spell (That Shouldn't Be Read Out Loud). Whether Dizzy actually read the heading is not known but - yikes! - he said the spell and it's caused a catastrophe- Dizzy's spirited all his Yolk Folk chums and Wizard Theo into the underworld! Cripes! There's only one course of action open to the brave little hero- read the spell again and spirit himself into the underworld to save his rotund group of pals!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "November 11, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "The Big Red Software Company", "publishers": "Codemasters Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spellbound_Dizzy", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/LJ_x_WUr0zI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6270-spellbound-dizzy\n"}
