{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dracula", "overview": "Dracula is a text adventure based on Bram Stoker's novel of the same name. The player takes the role of Jonathan Harker, a lawyer who visits a certain Count Dracula in his castle. The game is divided into three separate text adventures which can be played independently, but build up on each other. The First Night is about Harker's travels to the castle and The Arrival deals with his time in the castle. During The Hunt, the last third of the story, the protagonist changes to Dr. Seward, the manager of the insane asylum in Whitby, Yorkshire. The game itself is mostly concerned with story telling and atmosphere; it is relatively light on puzzle solving. The parser only understands verb + noun combinations.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Rod Pike", "publishers": "CRL (Computer Rentals Limited)", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/97402-dracula\n"}
