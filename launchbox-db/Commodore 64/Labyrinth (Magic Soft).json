{"altername_name": [], "name": "Labyrinth (Magic Soft)", "overview": "Labyrinth is a maze game in which two balls started a competition. Whoever is the fastest through the 50 levels of Xanden is the winner. The game is primarily a multiplayer split-screen game, but can also be played alone. The principle is simple: a maze is shown in a top-down view and the goal is to find the exit as fast as possible. In the mazes a few extra symbols can be found, e.g. one sends the player back to the beginning.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bluestone Productions", "publishers": "Magic Soft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109292-labyrinth-magic-soft\n"}
