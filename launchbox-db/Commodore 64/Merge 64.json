{"altername_name": [], "name": "Merge 64", "overview": "Merge 64 is a puzzle game by Nick \"Arlasoft\" Sherman, with music and SFX by Richard Bayliss. It is based on a mobile game called Shoot 'n' Merge, which itself is loosely based on 2048. The blocks continually scroll from right to left. You can move your block on the left to any path you like, and then press fire to launch it down the path. If it stops next to a block or blocks containing the same number, they will merge to create a block of double value. Each extra block merged doubles the value further, and newly merged or moved blocks can also combine with blocks next to them to create long chain-reactions. The game ends when any of the blocks reach the left-hand side.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "March 30, 2020", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Arlasoft", "publishers": "itch.io", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAjgUKKz_LM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/155097-merge-64\n"}
