{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ferry", "overview": "Ferry is a timing game where the player must navigate a remote-controlled supply ferry through an asteroid field. The entire screen is comprised of one big scrolling asteroid field. The player must navigate a number of ferries across the screen. There are only two buttons, one for moving forward and one for moving back. The player gains a score based on the time it took to move all ferries across (and how many actually made it all the way).
