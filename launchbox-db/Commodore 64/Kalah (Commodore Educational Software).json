{"altername_name": [], "name": "Kalah (Commodore Educational Software)", "overview": "In Kalah you play against the computer in this turn-based game. It is played with a board consisting of 12 small holes, two scoring wells and 72 stones. Each player (North and South) owns the six holes closest to them (numbered 1 to 6) and one scoring well at opposite ends of the board. The game starts with six seeds in each non-scoring hole. The game ends when one player does not have a legal move. The winner is the player with the most seeds in their scoring well. How Play Proceeds The player whose turn it is chooses one of the 6 holes they own which is not empty. The seeds from that hole are removed and deposited one by one into the subsequent holes moving counter clockwise, skipping only the opponent's scoring well. (Example moves are shown below). If the last seed is deposited into the current player's scoring well, that player must take another turn. (An exception to this is the first turn, see Pie Rule). If the last seed is deposited into an empty hole owned by the current player and the hole opposite is not empty, the player captures all of the seeds in the opposite hole plus the capturing seed, which go into the player's scoring well. The player's turn ends with a capture or when the last seed is deposited into a hole other than the player's scoring well.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bill Finzer", "publishers": "Commodore Educational Software", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/107371-kalah-commodore-educational-software\n"}
