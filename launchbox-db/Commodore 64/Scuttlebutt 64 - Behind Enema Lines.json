{"altername_name": [], "name": "Scuttlebutt 64: Behind Enema Lines", "overview": "Scuttlebutt 64: Behind Enema Lines is a creation of veteran game designer and cartoonist Karl H\u00f6rnell. It' is an updated version of his earlier game on the ZX Spectrum titled Scuttle Butt. The original Scuttle Butt only had one level, which is a take on the old Nintendo Game & Watch classic Oil Panic. The 64 has three other sub-games added to the original... All four mini-games have to be repeated across three stages...the first stage takes part in your character's own living room. The second stage takes part in the Louvre in Paris, and the third and final stage occurs in Donald Trump's Oval Office. There is no doubt that the poo gimmick to Scuttlebutt 64 is somewhat (deliberately) tasteless and would turn many people away from this game. But get past this and what you have is a game that hooks you in with its simplicity and challenge, all presented with high quality, smooth flowing graphics. Yes the humour within the game is crude but it is clever at the same time.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2018", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Karl H\u00f6rnell", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZgbnMbkQU8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/118401-scuttlebutt-64-behind-enema-lines\n"}
