{"altername_name": [], "name": "Star MIG", "overview": "This is VG Vox's final submission for the compo. This is a fun vertical scrolling Denarius inspired SEUCK creation. Your mission is to fly your Star MIG fighter past several alien bases, and make a good mess out of them. Then try to reach your home port. You are going to be having a real tough fight on your hands - so you'd better have that FIRE BUTTON handy and an appetite for intergalactic destruction.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2019", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Chris Yates", "publishers": "The New Dimension (TND)", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mWJK_Bbpls", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/129542-star-mig\n"}
