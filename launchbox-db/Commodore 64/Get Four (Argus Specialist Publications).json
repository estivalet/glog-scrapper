This is a version of the popular children's game transferred from paper to the Commodore 64. The screen is a grid of 49 squares in seven rows of seven. Each vertical row is assigned a letter from A to G. You press the key for the row you want and a sprite crosses the top of the screen to the selected row and then down to the square higher than previously selected. A square is then printed and the sprite disappears. The object of the game is to get a row of four squares horizontally, vertically or diagonally, while preventing your opponent from doing the same.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Peter Howe", "publishers": "Argus Specialist Publications", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/102097-get-four-argus-specialist-publications\n"}
