{"altername_name": [], "name": "Galaxian", "overview": "The objective is destroy endless 'waves' of enemies. The enemy ships are arranged in a formation at the top of the screen. At regular intervals enemy ships on the sides of the formation swoop down and shoot at the player. There are 4 different types of enemy ship, each type behaves differently on its attacking run. The player must destroy all ships in a wave to complete it. With a minor exception that one yellow ship may disappear after a bombing run and will appear as an extra yellow ship in the following wave. The yellow ships attack in a formation with two red ships, the order these three are destroyed determines the points awarded for destroying the yellow. The maximum is 800 points if the two reds are destroyed first. Once a wave has been completed a red flag is added to the bottom of the screen. When 10 flags are accumulated they are replaced by a larger flag.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Namco", "publishers": "Atarisoft", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.78", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxian", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVD2x0uaEjk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/23934-galaxian\n"}
