{"altername_name": [], "name": "Eoroid", "overview": "Eoroid is a puzzle game played on a 19x9 board. The main goal is to remove all the blocks from the board within limited numbers of moves. By clicking on a single spot, the player affects all the fields around by their reversal, including the chosen one. The filled block disappears and a blank spot is replaced with the filled block. Basically, each taken action reverses simultaneously 9 fields, one in the middle, and 8 around (3x3 square). The game features 60 levels altogether.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Inflexion Development", "publishers": "L.K.
