{"altername_name": [], "name": "Slayer", "overview": "As the ruthless Slayer you have hordes of enemies to wipe out in this horizontally-scrolling shooter. The paths are narrow and treacherous in a similar way to Scramble, so shooting out the wall-mounted installations is important. There are plenty of bonus weapons and shields available however, and 5 lives in total. Each of the 3 levels ends with a boss to defeat.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Imperial Software Designs", "publishers": "Hewson Consultants", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slayer_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1gF3e1xMQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/95614-slayer\n"}
