{"altername_name": [], "name": "Brickout", "overview": "It\u2019s always a shame when you come across a title which is still fairly recent, but seems to have just been left by the wayside. Brickout is one such game, which when released back in 2007 in its preview form, won a lot of fans for whoever played it. It was a great conversion of a popular Android/PC game. Overall it looks pretty complete, and not really needing a huge amount to finish it all off. Just what happened to the game and will it ever be finished? We hope to find out from the developers very soon!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2007", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Christian Kleinhuis", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/160374-brickout\n"}
