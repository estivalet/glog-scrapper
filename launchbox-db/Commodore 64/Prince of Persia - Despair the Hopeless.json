{"altername_name": ["Prince of Persia: Despair: the Hopeless"], "name": "Prince of Persia: Despair the Hopeless", "overview": "It is a time of darkness. While the Sultan is off fighting a foreign war, his Grand Vizier Jaffar has seized the reins of power. Throughout the land, the people groan under the yoke of tyranny, and dream of better days. You are the only obstacle between Jaffar and the throne. An adventurer from a foreign land, innocent of palace intrigues, you have won the heart of the Sultan's lovely daughter. And in so doing, you have unwittingly made a powerful enemy. On Jaffar's orders, you are arrested, stripped of your sword and possessions, and thrown into the Sultan's dungeons. Prince of Persia: Despair the Hopeless is a Custom set of level based on the original DOS Prince of Persia game. This mod was originally created for the Dos version by Clavio, and converted to the C64 by Starwindz and released in the Prince of Persia Total Pack. It is a \"Black Cat\" run, intended to be difficult to the point of torturous and is NOT for the faint of heart. Just when you think you have a level solved you will need to go back to nearly the start to continue forward progress.
