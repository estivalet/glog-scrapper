Achim and team present us with a modern C64 remake of Keystone Capers (Atari 2600), and we\u2019re glad they did! You are Mr. Smith, beginning your qualifying training as a police officer. Thrown into the deep end, all you need to do is catch the criminal and stay alive while completing each shift. Sounds easy! Well, no. With obstacles and criminal accomplices out to make your task even more difficult, failure may be imminent!
