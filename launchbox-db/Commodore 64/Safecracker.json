{"altername_name": [], "name": "Safecracker", "overview": "A math-centric educational game created by Genevi\u00e8ve Ludinski and released in 1983 in the book \"Brainteasers for the Commodore 64\". Are you a quick-thinker or a deep thinker? I hope you are one or the other, or you will never be able to crack open someone else's safe! This game can be played two different ways, depending on how you think. If you are not sure, playing it both ways and finding out which gives you the higher score may give you some insight. In all cases, a closed, locked safe is displayed and you are given two clues about the secret code that opens it. If you work out the exact answer before keying the in the code, you are given 2 minutes to do it. If you make guesses, then you are only allowed 16 seconds. Wrong answers are ignored. If you take too long then you are surprised by the caretaker who switches on the light, the then presses the alarm button and you hear the police sirens wailing and you know all is lost. If you do manage to crack the code in time, the safe opens, revealing gold bullion. You are given 2 clues, the code is always a 2 digit number. Key in the number (you do not need to hit return).", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Genevi\u00e8ve Ludinski", "publishers": "Phoenix Publishing Associates", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/134771-safecracker\n"}
