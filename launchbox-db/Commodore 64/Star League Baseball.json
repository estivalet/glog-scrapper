{"altername_name": ["On Field Baseball"], "name": "Star League Baseball", "overview": "In this traditional baseball simulation, gameplay takes place mainly on a split screen.One side shows an overview of the field, the other showing the batter, with the latter view disappearing when the ball is hit. The game requires you to \"draft\" a team before play, composing the best possible squad based on each player's skill attributes. The game also allows a semblance of managerial control, and has an optional batting practice mode to warm up. It then allows you to play individual games, or participate in a 4 division, 24-team championship.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "John A.
