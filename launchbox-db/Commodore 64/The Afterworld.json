Before you push the button, let me warn you that playing this game can cause lots of irritation because it is almost impossible to finish it. But let's see what you can do.

However, the boss of The Afterworld allows only the best people in his land. This means that you will have to deserve your place in The Afterworld by proving your strength, intelligence and speed by completing a number of tests, within a time limit.
