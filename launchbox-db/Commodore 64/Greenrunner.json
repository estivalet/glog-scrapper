{"altername_name": ["Greenrunner / Redrunner"], "name": "Greenrunner", "overview": "Released back in 2006 at the Game Over(view) Freestyle Jam, Greenrunner literally blew the competition away with it's frantic arcade gameplay and amazing mix of sampled speech and high quality soundtrack. It's a game so hardcore and visually intense that it's probable that even Jeff Minter would beg for mercy at the thought of having to beat all 100 levels. Grab a friend (or take on the challenge solo), jump into your Cyanitizer and Yellowizer battle craft, buckle up and warm up the four-directional bug-blasting pesticide cannons. This is going to be one hell of a trip. Released by Psytronik in a dual pack with Redrunner.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2006", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Aleksi Eeben", "publishers": "Psytronik Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/fJjacrMu8z8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/125388-greenrunner\n"}
