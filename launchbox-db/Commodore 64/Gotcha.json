{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gotcha", "overview": "Published in COMPUTE! 1984/02 (Issue #45). The idea is to get all the money you can lay your hands on, and outwit the Collector while you're at it. But you'd better be quick, because he's not that interested in the money itself, he wants to catch YOU. You begin the game inside a diamond pattern in the middle of the screen, with the Collector on your heels. Once out of the diamond, you're free to move up, down and diagonally in your effort to grab the dollars and elude the Collector. If you get trapped near the side you can run off the screen and wrap around to the other side, but beware - the Collector knows where you are and he comes onto the screen headed straight for you. You might not see him in time to escape and then it's Gotcha! If you survive until the money is gone, you move on to the next, more difficult round. If you survive 18 rounds, you can retire or play again.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Doug Smoak", "publishers": "COMPUTE!
