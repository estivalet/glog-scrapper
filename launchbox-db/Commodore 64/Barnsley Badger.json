{"altername_name": [], "name": "Barnsley Badger", "overview": "In this game inspired by the Monty Mole series you play Barnsley, a lazy, good for nothing badger whose addiction to gambling has got him into all sorts of trouble. One night in his local boozer he overhears a conversation. A gold coin was discovered in the nearby graveyard, a coin carved with the head of the fabled ruler Tutanbodger on one side. If Barnsley can find the lost treasure of Tutanbodger it would solve all his money problems. A great journey awaits - as long as he doesn't fall asleep on the way!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2016", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Georg Rottensteiner", "publishers": "Psytronik Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xL-YiK4Z8Jo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106402-barnsley-badger\n"}
