Two crabs, one red and one purple, are pitted against each other in a duel to reach 200 points. The game begins with a crab race. A clam is placed in the center of the playing area. The first crab to reach the clam takes possession of it. Each player must try to protect an octopus and at the same time attempt to eliminate the opponent's octopus by shooting the clam at it.
