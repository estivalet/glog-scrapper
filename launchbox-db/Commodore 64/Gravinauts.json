Gravinauts (aka Space Walk in the Caesar Software release) requires you to fight for survival in the hostile environment of the planet Arkion. n the world of Arkion, Survival is a tough business. Because the surface of the planet is covered by a deadly acidic ocean, the inhabitants must remain ontinuously in the air, supported by rocket backpacks. To stay up, they engage in a never-ending war for fuel. The loser is doomed to a very short lifespan. The Gravinauts, as they are called by the colonies of the Milky Way, battle each other by trying to reach a higher vantage point in the air than their opponents and smashing into them, destabilizing their gyros and causing their backpacks to explode. Because the fuel tanks stored higher up in the atmosphere are more closely guarded, they are entrusted with greater fuel supplies. They are therefore more important than the ones resting on the lower \"ice glaciers,\" which are huge bodies of frozen chemicals floating in the air above the ocean. The purpose of the game is to take fuel off the glaciers,", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Cleveland M.
