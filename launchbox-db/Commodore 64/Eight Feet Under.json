{"altername_name": ["Eight Feet Under: A Hibernated 1 Addon"], "name": "Eight Feet Under", "overview": "A stand alone text adventure that builds on the game Hibernated 1, not quite a sequel but the game as seen through the eyes of an unusual and rather unexpected protagonist: Vermin Extermination Unite 4, aka Vlad. Eight Feet Under reveals a previously unknown part of the Hibernated 1 events, so it is essential to complete the main game first. The add-on takes a much less narrative and more puzzle-oriented approach.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "November 18, 2018", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Stefan Vogt", "publishers": "Puddle Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/129702-eight-feet-under\n"}
