Published in Super VIC & C64 game pack in Italy. You must defend your fleet of base ships against wave after wave of lightning-fast Osirian attackers as they weave and dodge through your covering fire. The Osirians do not descend blindly; they counter your evasive moves and seek you out. Theirs is a maniacal mission. The object is to shoot the falling Osirians, but at the same time they'll use their intelligence to try to destroy you. You can choose from 240 speed levels, with level 1 being the fastest. You may also choose between 1-240 base ships. Be prepared to battle as many as eight Osirians at a time.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gregg Peele", "publishers": "COMPUTE!
