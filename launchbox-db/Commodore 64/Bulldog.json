{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bulldog", "overview": "Bulldog is a vertically scrolling shooter. Piloting a small ship, your goal is to blast your way through enemy defenses to destroy the mother ship. Your enemy, the POLON's, have heavily reinforced the path you must take: on each level you may encounter up to seven types of firing installations as well as various walls which will block your progress. Crash into a wall or get hit by enemy fire and you lose a ship; the game ends when all of your reserve ships have been lost. At the end of each level you will face a mothership; to destroy this you will need to take out all of the guns and other installations located on the ship after which you continue on to the next, more difficult level. Your ship is equipped with lasers to destroy obstacles, and additional powerups can be located along the way. Extra speed, extra firepower, repeat fire, bombs, and other bonuses can be picked up to help you out.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gremlin Graphics Software", "publishers": "Future Publishing", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzTh65ljT2E", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90201-bulldog\n"}
