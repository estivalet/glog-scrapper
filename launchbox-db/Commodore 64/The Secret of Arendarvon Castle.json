{"altername_name": ["Het Mysterie Van Arendarvon Castle"], "name": "The Secret of Arendarvon Castle", "overview": "The Secret Of Arendarvon Castle was published in the form of type-in listings in a book of the same name that was lavishly illustrated and contained a lot of supplementary material. THE SECRET OF ARENDARVON CASTLE involves no annihilation, obliteration or vaporization of innocent aliens. It's a micro world adventure with a difference. This value for money mystery adventure is set in the remote castle of Arendarvon in Scotland, where a journalist mysteriously disappears whilst investigating a series of strange events. It is your task to retrace his footsteps throughout the perilous secret passageways of the Castle. Descriptions, maps and illustrations will provide the clues to help you survive this ordeal. The program listing is given at the end of the book and the programming is arranged on a day-to-day basis so that you do not have to key in the program all in one go. The last digit of each line checks the program for errors so you know immediately if you have made a mistake. You need no previous experience of programming, just a vivid imagination and a little boldness.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hal Renko", "publishers": "Addison-Wesley Publishers", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/110343-the-secret-of-arendarvon-castle\n"}
