{"altername_name": [], "name": "Flyer Fox", "overview": "The game is a shooter, seen from the cockpit perspective of the Flyer Fox. Each level begins with an automatic takeoff so the Fox finds itself behind the airliner to protect. Soon, enemy fighters will appear and must be shot down with the Fox's guns to keep the jumbo from harm. Cockpit instrumentation includes a radar, a compass and an artificial horizon, to be used to locate any enemies and also to find one's way back to the protected plane. There is also a status line that displays the current damage level of the airliner. If either the jumbo is shot down or the Fox's fuel runs out before all enemies are shot down, it's game over. In later levels the difficulty increases, with the enemy planes being more agile and actually shooting back.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Game Gems", "publishers": "TYMAC Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "0.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKggZnKmUmU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/110490-flyer-fox\n"}
