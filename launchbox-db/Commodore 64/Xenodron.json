{"altername_name": [], "name": "Xenodron", "overview": "Published in both Magic Disk 64 1988/12, and in Digital Marketing PD #098. Xenodron is a game for thinkers. It is reminiscent of the legendary 'four in a row'. Here, too, wins if you are the first to have four stones in a row next to each other. The stones are pushed onto the playing field from below and from the right, whereby stones disappear from the top and left if necessary. The fight is against the computer, which wins a lot of games especially at the beginning and is such a good teacher.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "J\u00fcrgen Graser", "publishers": "CP Verlag", "genres": "Casino", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGwhvI4tD6s", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137586-xenodron\n"}
