{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hyper Aggressive", "overview": "A logic\\brain game by Helge Sascha Anders Kozielek and released in Game On 1992/12. Hyper Aggressive is a strategic puzzle game aiming to provide some sensitivity for the binary numeral system. The playing area mainly consists of fields coloured in red or blue (the colours of the players) or grey (neutral areas). These fields are either numbered 0 or 1.

Since the game follows binary patterns, changing the value of one field will also affect the neighbouring values...", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "X-ample Architectures", "publishers": "CP Verlag", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/105942-hyper-aggressive\n"}
