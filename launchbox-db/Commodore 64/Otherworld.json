{"altername_name": ["AQuest"], "name": "Otherworld", "overview": "The game is a flick screen platformer, which has a very similar look and feel to Thing on a Spring, but with a bouncing Amiga red/white ball as the main character. Things are split across 6 levels in total, including themes such as Kitchen, Toys and Plants. You essentially have to switch off a load of switches on each level, to open a door at the end of the map to escape. In your way are a number of platforms, conveyor belts and creatures trying to stop you. You get one life and large block of energy to play with, which means the game is pretty tough.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Andrew Morrish", "publishers": "Mr. Chip Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5U-nX8VY5Vk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/123274-otherworld\n"}
