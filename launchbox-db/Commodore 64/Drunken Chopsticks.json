{"altername_name": [], "name": "Drunken Chopsticks", "overview": "Garnering 2nd place at the C64 Game Competition at BCC Party #14, this game has you in the chair of Daniel, karate student of Mr Miyagi, after a day of waxing and painting just trying to enjoy a bowl of noodles. However, Mr. Miyagi doesn't have air conditioning and you must keep the flies away from the bowl. You need to use your chopsticks to stop flies from getting into Mr Miyagi's broth. Failure to do this three times and you'll be quickly forced out into the garden to perform another mind numbing task of painting the fence.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "February 22, 2020", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Christian (q0w)", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/7TtKBY3igCc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/158622-drunken-chopsticks\n"}
