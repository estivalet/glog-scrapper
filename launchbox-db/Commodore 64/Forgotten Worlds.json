It's their job to rid the planet of the attacking aliens. Guiding your character around the screen as they fly with jet-packs, guns on full auto, you control a satellite which you rotate around your character for the direction in which your gun is firing. At the end of each level is a boss which needs to be killed to progress. Enemies that have been killed drop money. At the end of every level is a shop where you can buy weapons, armour, items and first-aid packs.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "October 2, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Arc Developments", "publishers": "Capcom U.S.A.", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgotten_Worlds", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am_hDd62LQo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/7781-forgotten-worlds\n"}
