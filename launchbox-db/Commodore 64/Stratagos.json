{"altername_name": [], "name": "Stratagos", "overview": "A puzzle\\Brain\\Logic game created by Drew Rodger and released as part of the \"GEMS\" game pack. A puzzle game with fiendishly addictive qualities which will appeal to everyone, even those who do not normally enjoy this type of game. The simple gameplay coupled with the rapidly decreasing timer and often dexterous joystick requirements quickly causes the \"just one more game\" syndrome to take over and will keep even hardened arcade players glued to their seats. The game is an 8x8 grid full of colored blocks, the object of the game is to place blocks into B in such a way as to match those already in A.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Andrew Rodger", "publishers": "Digital Dynamite Productions", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4oLbt563yo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/130710-stratagos\n"}
