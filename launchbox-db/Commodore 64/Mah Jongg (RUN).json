{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mah Jongg (RUN)", "overview": "A Mahjong solitaire game developed by John V. Ryan and released as a type-in game in RUN 1992/01-02. Not to be confused with the Markt & Technik game of the same name, which was released shortly after this. Call for take-out! This ancient Chinese game of skill promises late hours of addictive fun. I clench my eyes to ease the stinging dryness. Alter a moment's pause I turn back to my 64, mind racing. With a burning stare I review the board: There was another nine somewhere. Did I take it already? There! It's blocked by a three \u2014 where's the other deuce? Got it! Back to the nines and I've opened up the whole row. I know the matches, remember where they are \u2014 move quickly for max points \u2014 clear the board \u2014 record your score!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "John V.
