{"altername_name": [], "name": "Caverns of Carnage", "overview": "A shooter from the book \"Time lost\", created by Kirk Ostby and programmed by Joseph C. Giarratano for the C64. Jacque and Erin are in the fearsome and eerie Caverns of Carnage, attacked by the savage Crusher beasts. How long can they survive the Chase that no one has ever gotten through? How far can YOU get them through the caverns? In this game, Jacque is on the right and Erin on the left. Jacque\u2019s Positron Blaster will destroy the loathsome Crushers and score points for each one disintegrated. You get more points the closer they are when you blast them. Each new cavern is narrower and more treacherous than the previous one, but you score more points. Watch out\u2014if a Crusher gets Jacque or Erin from the front or if they crash into a wall or Crusher, the game is over. Use the \u201cS\u201d key to move them left, the \u201cD\u201d key to move them right and hold the space bar to fire.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Joseph C.
