The wagon can only be moved to the right and to the left side. Every failed attempt ends with a loss of life. In 1994 the game made by the same authors called Under the Ground was released, with slightly different graphics and coal falling from above (instead of diamonds).", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Marcin Ossowski", "publishers": "Diamond", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/134638-the-underground\n"}
