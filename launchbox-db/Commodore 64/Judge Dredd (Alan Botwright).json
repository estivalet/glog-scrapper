{"altername_name": ["Justice Central"], "name": "Judge Dredd (Alan Botwright)", "overview": "Just another day for Judge Dredd in Mega City One as he fights crime and tries to return the city back to some normality. You play the Judge as he tries to attempt six missions of crime. Once a mission is completed there is a bonus level related to the last mission to attempt. Take too long to complete a mission and the crime rate rises. Let the rate get too high and it's game over. To aid the Judge you have various weapons to fire and also your Lawmaster bike. This allows you to move around faster but you can't fire your weapon or arrest people thus making the crime rate rise. Judge Dredd is a side view platform game that scrolls as you move left or right. Pressing the space bar allows you to change from walking to riding your bike. The joystick controls your character while the fire button shoots your weapon.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Alan Botwright", "publishers": "Virgin Mastertronic", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S2YPuU3Pww", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/107299-judge-dredd-alan-botwright\n"}
