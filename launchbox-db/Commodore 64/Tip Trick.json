{"altername_name": ["Tip-Trick"], "name": "Tip Trick", "overview": "The playfield is a 6x6 grid and on each tile except one is a part of a pipe. A ball starts to roll through the pipes to a pre-defined ending point and the player needs to make sure that it both reaches its goal without meeting a dead end and that it passes all pipe parts once. To meet this goal, the player needs to push the tiles around the field. One tile is empty and acts as an buffer. So, as example, if the player clicks on a tile which is a few tiles away from the hole, all tiles between the clicked tile and the hole are moved by one towards the hole. Then the hole is at the place where the player clicked on. There are 60 levels.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Blue-Store Products", "publishers": "Magic Soft", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ26pWHfNgc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/76131-tip-trick\n"}
