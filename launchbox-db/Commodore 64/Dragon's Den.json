Enter this subterranean nightmare at your own risk. Finding your way out of the dragon-infested dungeon of the Castle Dunsmore is an unenviable task. The damp, soot-covered and blood-stained chambers are part of a dangerous labyrinth. If things don't go well, you could perish from lack of food or water. And if you're not quick on your feet you could suffer a more horrifying fate at the jaws of a dragon.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Clark Book", "publishers": "COMPUTE!
