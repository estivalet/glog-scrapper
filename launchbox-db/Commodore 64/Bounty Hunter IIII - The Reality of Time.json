{"altername_name": ["Bounty Hunter IV: The Reality of Time"], "name": "Bounty Hunter IIII: The Reality of Time", "overview": "Another game in the Bounty Hunter series this time with somewhat improved graphics, more types of enemies and a bit more challenge. But everything does look startlingly similar to earlier games in the series. That, along with a lack of understanding in how Roman numerals work make this a bit of a lackluster release. That said, if you enjoyed the previous parts of the collection enough is the same that you will likely enjoy this one.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Chris Yates", "publishers": "Champion Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCaLww-IBOE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/146241-bounty-hunter-iiii-the-reality-of-time\n"}
