{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hunt the Wumpus II", "overview": "Take your hunting of the Wumpi to the next level with this faithful recreation of the sequel to one of the oldest text strategy games created. The game is presented in text only. The player walks through a cave system and must hunt Wumpi by shooting them with arrows. Each turn the player can move to any adjacent room, fire an arrow in any adjacent room, look up the remaining number of arrows, exit a cave (when near an exit) or show instructions. If the player walks into the same room as a Wumpus it's game over. There are also other traps: superbats that will send the player to a different cave and bottomless pits that kill. From time to time earthquakes can occur which can block or open certain passages between rooms. At any time the player can sense the hazards which are in adjacent rooms, but not in which adjacent room they are.
