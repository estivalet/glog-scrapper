{"altername_name": [], "name": "Grfx-Jump", "overview": "A strategy puzzle game created by Tobias Erbsland and released in 64'er 1994/04. Originally created to be an under-5k bytes game. The playing field (starting level: 00) consists of yellow, blue and purple game pieces in front of a scrolling background. The important thing is the white arrow in the lower part of the screen, which can be controlled with the joystick in port 2. You move it in the direction of the arrow. In the case of intentional changes of direction using the joystick, it does not always turn into the desired position. If you drive over yellow plates, they disappear. If you get tiles with sawed-off corners, the number of \u201csuper jumps*\u201d increases. Attention: it is set to zero when the game starts - but you can only jump if you have at least one free jump! So you should get the necessary bonus as soon as possible - we'll leave that to your puzzling skills (the field with the torn corner can be found, for example, in level 0 on the far left of the screen). The gaping holes in space (i.e. gaps between the plates) should be avoided like the plague - otherwise you will trundle hopelessly into Orkus. But the gap isn't bigger than, for example, the size of a game piece, it can be bridged safely with a super jump. If you have cleaned all the blocks from the screen within the time limit (caution; you only have two minutes!), you will automatically be beamed to the next higher level.
