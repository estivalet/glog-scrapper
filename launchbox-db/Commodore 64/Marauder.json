{"altername_name": [], "name": "Marauder", "overview": "Captain C T Cobra has the task of travelling through planet Mergatron where the jewels of Ozymandias have been placed by their captors. The road is long and tough but he has a Battlecar at his disposal. You play Cobra as he journeys vertically, taking out the mounted turrets and enemy cars as he goes. There are also colored turrets to shoot at - each colour represents a particular change to your car's performance (there are a few temporary negative ones alongside the upgrades). You have 16 smart bombs, which may sound generous, but just watch them go. A boss must be beaten at the end of each level.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Arcanum Software Developments", "publishers": "Hewson Consultants", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.87", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQZyYT-d7V8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/110501-marauder\n"}
