{"altername_name": [], "name": "Time Machine", "overview": "In Time Machine, the player takes control over Professor Potts whose main profession is building time machines. As terrorists bomb his laboratory, he gets sucked ten million years into the past. During the course of his adventure he will visit five time zones with five screens each. This is an adventure with action elements. Most of the game is spent manipulating objects in the different time zones which have an effect on a later zone, e.g. planting a seed in the stone age will cause a tree to appear in the later zones. He also may need to bring an object from one time to another. In each zone there is one big puzzle to solve in order to get access to the next zone (the ultimate goal is to prevent the time machine from getting destroyed), but constant traveling between the time zones is necessary.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Vivid Image", "publishers": "Activision (UK)", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.63", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvyvrsUfbq8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6254-time-machine\n"}
