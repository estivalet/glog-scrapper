{"altername_name": ["Jessy the Worm"], "name": "Jessy der Wurm", "overview": "A single screen platformer created by Christian V., Gerhard E. & Andreas Veber and published by Verlag Heinz Heise GmbH in Input 64 1988/09. There's the worm in there - you might think when you look at the game. But this little animal doesn't hide in the program, but only wreaks havoc on the screen. Jessy the Worm has already become a video classic. The program was written by Christian Veber from Innsbruck. It's a game where you have to try to guide a worm-like character through some kind of maze. Unfortunately, this game cannot be run within INPUT64. Through graphics and music, it has become a program colossus. It was therefore compacted in order to be able to load it with our operating system at all. If the program were started, it would overwrite the INPUT64 operating system and INPUT64 would no longer be able to run. So the program will not start; therefore follow the instructions and save the program as usual on your own data medium with CTRL-S. The aim of the game is to guide a worm through a maze while collecting as many gold plates as possible. Of course, this is not without danger, because obstacles and mines are built into the walls, which the worm must not touch under any circumstances. Once you have collected a certain amount of gold, you get to the next higher level.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "September 1, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Laser Mind Productions", "publishers": "Verlag Heinz Heise GmbH", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWYt6PLoiG0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/160660-jessy-der-wurm\n"}
