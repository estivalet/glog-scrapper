The game consists of 6 levels, on which you must obtain treasures and - of course - a map that allows you to leave the labyrinthine pyramid alive. You must avoid dangerous acid drops, mummies, spiders, vampires, etc. In order to defend yourself from those disagreeable enemies you have at your disposition a gun (with limited bullets), but some enemies are immune to guns, and you must jump or avoid them.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "January 1, 1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Indescomp", "publishers": "Quicksilva", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUc8M4Tqqg0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27313-fred\n"}
