Catch them in your boat or throw a net overboard so that they can clamber to safely. be quick for they jump in pairs, sometimes in threes in the hope that safely in numbers will buy them time. Should you miss them, they will try to swim to safely but beware the shark could catch them. Look out of the pterodactyls as they swoop in with an ear piercing screech and pluck a man out of the boat. their lives depend on you!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "J.
