{"altername_name": [], "name": "Blazing Castles", "overview": "A graphic adventure game you search a 256-room castle to locate the Treasure Room. Your chances for success are quite limited, as the castle is currently ablaze and fires in each room are spreading rapidly even though the doors that connect the rooms are sealed. The screen display contains two windows. The right window shows your current position in the castle, which the left window is used for a close-up view of each room. The center of each room will display a number from one to six, which represents the number of clues that must be gathered to open the doors of the room, it should be noted that some rooms will contain a flame instead of a number because the clues have already burned. The location of the treasure changes with every game.
