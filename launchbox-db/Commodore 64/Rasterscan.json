{"altername_name": [], "name": "Rasterscan", "overview": "The Rasterscan, a large damaged spacecraft, is drifting uncontrollably towards a nearby star. The Rasterscan can still be controlled and piloted to safety but only by a droid called MSB. Unfortunately, MSB is also damaged and (without help) can only repair toasters. The player needs to control MSB and, hopefully, use it to save the unfortunate spacecraft. The player controls MSB, a spherical droid who can float through the interior of the ship in all directions. MSB can interact with the craft's machinery and instruments, which all serve a purpose. It also needs to solve logic-puzzles in order to open doors (different puzzles for each door) to allow it access to more parts of the spacecraft.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Binary Design", "publishers": "Mastertronic", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasterscan", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1Sn-FjeQp4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/111944-rasterscan\n"}
