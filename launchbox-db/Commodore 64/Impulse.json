Something has pone very wrong down at the chip factory \u2014 silicon chips that is, not fish and... All of the memory circuits have started forgetting the data that they art supposed to he remembering! hi a desperate attempt to find out what has gone wrong and hopefully put it right, Floyd I he droid has been miniaturized and put onto i he surface of one of the faulty chips. The problem soon becomes obvious as the circuit is invaded by program bugs and data locks which roam across the chip, both trying to turn any data they find into garbage. As if the bugs and locks weren't enough, worst still are the sparks which shoot across the chip from the contacts on other side. Luckily Floyd can destroy the bugs and the locks by firing packets of random data at them but nothing has any effect on the sparks, Add to this the fact that if Floyd is caught by any of his adversaries then his own circuits will be scrambled, and you l an see that he might need some help!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "August 1, 1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Keith Suddick", "publishers": "Business Press International", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/139203-impulse\n"}
