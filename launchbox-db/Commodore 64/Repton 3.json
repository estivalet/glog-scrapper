{"altername_name": ["Repton III"], "name": "Repton 3", "overview": "Repton 3 involves retrieving treasure from cleverly constructed traps of falling rocks whilst avoiding the monsters and spirits. Repton is a game requiring dexterity, and logical thinking to solve its puzzles over 24 levels. This second sequel in the Repton franchise includes both a sprite editor and level editor so that players can design and share their own levels with each other. Other improvements over the previous Repton titles include larger levels, creeping poisonous fungus which grows at an alarming rate, time bombs and time capsules (for puzzles in the fourth dimension!).", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mark Robinson", "publishers": "Superior Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33T3_iv5by8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/111968-repton-3\n"}
