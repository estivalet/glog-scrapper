{"altername_name": [], "name": "Spearhead", "overview": "It is time for some classic shoot 'em up style action with Alf Yngve's latest blaster. Spearhead features some huge sprites and plenty of explosive action packed game play. There are also some pretty clever features, which of course is possible to implement in SEUCK. Take the small green mountains at the bottom of the screen for example. A real clever trick which requires no programming at all. The game is a real blast, you should try it. IINSTRUCTIONS: Your mission is to fly the Spearhead fighter across hostile territory, and destroy the four enemy strongholds. If you succeed in blasting the fourth and final stronghold, the message \"YOU DID IT!\" will appear. Good luck! CONTROLS: This is a 1 Player game, controllable by joystick or keyboard in Port 2. HOW TO PLAY THE GAME - Shoot down missiles before they explode into lethal shrapnel. - Shoot the ground turrets before you get caught in crossfire. - Shoot the aircraft before they hit you. - Collect the \"B\" capsule for a 2.000 point bonus. You are awarded an extra life for every 10.000 points you score. HINTS: - Some large enemy ships have a weak point. If you can hit it, you will score a big bonus. - There is a secret bonus you can score by shooting a certain object many times.
