{"altername_name": [], "name": "Orion (CP Verlag)", "overview": "A Logic\\Brain game created by Marc Schubert and published in Magic Disk 64 1993/06. This is neither a computerized version of the cult science fiction series from the 1960s, nor an action-packed shooting game. \"Orion\" is a genuine thinking and puzzle game that is particularly impressive due to its simple gameplay. Attention! Addictive! The playing field is divided into two parts. On the right there is a matrix that contains several stones. Each stone is given a number so that the task should now be clear. You must try with great skill to transfer the diagram shown on the right to the left side. If you place a stone, all stones left and right next to it, above and below it are increased by the value one. In this way, the specified matrix can be reproduced. At first everything is quite simple, but at higher levels the time limit gets tighter and hectic joystick rowing is often the result. Tip: Always stay relaxed! After every 10. Level you will receive a password that you can use again in the next game so that you don't have to start all over again. If you have reached a high enough score to get into the highscore list, you can of course save it.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Marc Schubert", "publishers": "CP Verlag", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/123232-orion-cp-verlag\n"}
