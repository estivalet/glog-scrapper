{"altername_name": [], "name": "Magic Fields", "overview": "A puzzler with some nice music, the game was created by Cream Software and published in Magic Disk 64 1993/03. Magic Fields \"is a puzzle game with 99 levels and a storable high score. The aim of the game is to clear the playing field to remove all visible mussels free. If you press the fire button, so will all the surrounding fields inverted in all four cardinal directions, whereby this process also includes the field under the hand. In this way, the whole playing field must now be cleaned. A level is only considered solved when no shell is visible any more. At the beginning you have three lives. As soon as the available time drops to zero, you lose a life and the timekeeper shows 999 again. With \"RUN / STOP\" the game can be stopped, but the screen will be cleared at the same time. This avoids the player cheating on additional thinking time. If you want to capitulate to this tough logic game, you just have to press \"RESTORE\" to get back to the main menu. After you have lost your last life, you can add yourself to the highscore list (or not!), Which is then immediately updated on disk.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Cream Software", "publishers": "CP Verlag", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zMSnQs0yMY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/121695-magic-fields\n"}
