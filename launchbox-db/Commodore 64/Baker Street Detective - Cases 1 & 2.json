{"altername_name": ["Baker Street Detective"], "name": "Baker Street Detective: Cases 1 & 2", "overview": "Baker Street Detective is a text-based adventure game based upon the stories of Sherlock Holmes. The player plays as Dr. John H. Watson, the assistant of Sherlock Holmes. There are two separate mysteries to play: A Wasted Witness and The Scourge of the Executioner. The player must travel to different locations throughout Victorian London to gather clues regarding each mystery. Common locations to visit include: Scotland Yard, the Coroner's Office, the Criminology Office, and 221B Baker Street. Each location has a 3-digit code, which serves as copy protection, and as the player visits each location in the correct order, they receive clues regarding their mystery. The scenes at each location play out automatically, and the player only controls the locations they visit and their order. At any time, the player can choose to take an 8-question quiz on the mystery, based upon the clues they have discovered. If the player is able to answer all 10 questions correctly, they will have cracked the case. The player has a total of 3 attempts to answer all questions correctly. The player receives a final score based upon how many times they took the quiz, and the number of locations they had to visit.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "David Fogel", "publishers": "Artworx Software Company", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/126954-baker-street-detective-cases-1-2\n"}
