{"altername_name": [], "name": "Triton", "overview": "Triton is a 1-player vertically scrolling shooter for the Commodore 64. It was developed by The Power Unit and published in both 64'er Disc 1990/01 and in 64'er 1999/07. A robust \"Finger of Fire\" is required for this shooter. In the year 2095 hostile aliens besiege the planet Triton in the Orion star system. A few resistance fighters have gathered in a remote area to develop a weapon against the invaders: the DX-11, a gigantic spaceship with ultra-modern equipment. The day of reckoning has finally come... This is where you come in. Although you are neither involved in the resistance movement nor in the development of the fighter, you are given the \"honorable\" task of getting the potatoes out of the fire for the inhabitants of this planet. Well then, cheers! The aim of your mission is to destroy 100 ground stations in each level. You will be severely hampered by a few barriers that can neither be shot down nor flown over. Whole squadrons of alien spaceships scurry around between your feet and leave small guided mines as a nice souvenir. Your DX-11's protective shield can handle a total of eight of these mines.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "The Power Unit", "publishers": "Markt & Technik/64'er", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uegB4iJiFPk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/167215-triton\n"}
