And he is getting ready to make the fearsome, awesome, totally terrifying expedition down Through The Trap Door. If you have seen the creepy critters that live down there, you may well wonder why. But the truth is he has no choice. Boni has been captured and taken down into the the gloomy depths, so Berk and little Drut must go to the rescue, no matter what nasties they come up against.
