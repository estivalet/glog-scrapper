{"altername_name": ["Denaris"], "name": "Katakis", "overview": "Katakis is a side scrolling shooter style arcade game developed for the Commodore 64 by Rainbow Arts in 1988, and converted to the Commodore Amiga by Factor 5 in 1988. It was re-released as Denaris in 1989. The name Katakis has a Greek origin and was found in a phone book in G\u00fctersloh, Germany. The name Denaris was created by a random name generator, and by coincidence, matches a Greek name as well. The game takes place on the planet Katakis, a human colony in deep space. There, scientists developed machinery with advanced artificial intelligence capabilities. However, the machines eventually evolved beyond the control of their human creators and overtook the planet. The humans attempted to retaliate through the use of nuclear ballistic missiles, but the machines survived. The colonists' remaining plan is to use a series of DS-H75 Eagle Fighter space gliders to attack the machines and retake the planet. Katakis has a very similar theme as the game R-Type, with multiple levels, power-ups and various end-bosses. Players must eliminate enemy opponents to reach various end bosses. One major innovation is the fact that the two-player mode features the second player controlling the Force module. This creates an unusual play strategy of the attacker and the defender, since the main ship is vulnerable to enemy fire and hazards.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "September 8, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Rainbow Arts Software", "publishers": "Rainbow Arts Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.40", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katakis", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5GfqzS9Bog", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/9981-katakis\n"}
