{"altername_name": [], "name": "Match Buster", "overview": "A low memory, fast running version of Boulder Dash. Originally created by Simon Stelling for the RGCD C64 16KB Cartridge Game Development Competition 2012. It may look like a bog standard mini Boulder Dash clone, but it actually features some really clever design mechanics borrowed and inspired from a variety of other games (including Pushcat and Portal), and even an attract mode showing how the game is played! Already excellent, there's still a lot of blank space left in the 16KB rom for additional content making Match Buster another game that I hope will see further post-competition improvements.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2012", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Simon Stelling", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c8eh6hMhJU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75952-match-buster\n"}
