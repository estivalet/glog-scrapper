{"altername_name": ["Scarabaeus"], "name": "Invaders of the Lost Tomb", "overview": "The Pharoah's Lost Tomb contains the valuable emerald of Scarabaeus, and you have set off to find it. You walk around from an early first-person view with 90 degree movement and four views from each position, aided by a map. On the first level you must touch nine ghosts, to collect pieces of a key to know which of the objects you will later find are medicines, and which are potions. While on level 2, you must visit information sites - you will need this to survive on level 3. These are guarded by spiders, which must be trapped and lured away using doors. To move between levels you must guide a mechanical lift, by moving the joystick in smooth circles from inside it. This final level contains familiar safe bottles as well as poisonous ones - all stored on hidden shelves. It also contains zombies to avoid or trap. Before you can reach the emerald, you must solve a final puzzle involving hieroglyphs. Arrange a 4x4 grid so as to get the rows and columns to match, within 40 moves.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Andromeda Software", "publishers": "Ariolasoft", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.54", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/77583-invaders-of-the-lost-tomb\n"}
