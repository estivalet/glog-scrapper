{"altername_name": ["Alice in Adventureland"], "name": "Alice", "overview": "Published in Ahoy! 1985/01 (Issue #13) / no definite name, called \"Alice in Adventureland\" in the magazine. Im late! I'm late!\" cried the White Rabbit, glancing at his watch as he ran down the path Alice stared in wonderment as the well-dressed animal ran close by her. She had never seen a rabbit that carried a watch, let alone one that wore a waistcoat, and so, burning with curiosity, she took off after it. She followed the rabbit across a field to see it pop down a large rabbit hole. Without thought to the consequences, Alice jumped in after it. only to find herself falling. She fell for what seemed to be a very long time before landing safely (for she fell very slowly). She found herself in a small room with a single opening, Through it, and far ahead, Alice saw the White Rabbit as it disappeared around a corner. But as she started towards the doorway she noticed a small glass table (which certainly was not there before). On it lay a small fiat box. \"Oh. I can catch up to the rabbit later.\" she said to herself (although she really was not sure that she could), and went to examine the box. It appeared to be a computer of some sort, as it held a small LCD screen that read \"LEVEL 1\" and \"MAP.\" Also the rectangle was displayed, and within it was a tiny white square in the corner. \"Oh! That must mean that I am in the corner on the first level,\" the precocious girl deduced. Pleased to have such a useful device. Alice set off to find the White Rabbit, unaware of the many dangers and obstacles that lay ahead of her.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bob Spirko", "publishers": "Ion International, Inc.", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UE6TGPk41M", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86822-alice\n"}
