{"altername_name": [], "name": "So Little Time", "overview": "Originally a C64 game, written with the Quill by Danien Steele. (There was a later Spectrum port was created with the PAW by Martin Freemantle.) Despite the comment in the solution, this was not a Megapoints game. However, it *is* based around the goings on at the UK Adventurers' Convention, and [the C64 original] was written in response to a bet from fellow attendees that the author couldn't write a game in a day (it was actually written in one evening). Your task is to find and return objects, thus cheering up various people and finish all your tasks before the Convention's awards ceremony begins. The Commodore version has a limit of 200 moves.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Damien Steele", "publishers": "Adventure Probe Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/368229-so-little-time\n"}
