{"altername_name": [], "name": "Jet-Power Jack", "overview": "In this platform-action-game based on Jet Pac you have to collect the fuel pods for Jack's flying saucer. To do this you must negotiate the aliens using your jet pack, and then get the fuel pod and put it into your ship. This is not as easy as it seems, as the jet pack is very difficult to control! In the game you are imprisoned by the evil warlord Nogrob the Terrible, Jack the intergalactic hitchhiker must collect fuel pods from the other side of the garage to refill the waiting starships. With a fast diminishing oxygen supply, an erratic Turbopak, and a band of nasty Space Googjies to contend with, Jack certainly has problems!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gary Partis", "publishers": "Micro Power", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwbyrpDi-po", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/107214-jet-power-jack\n"}
