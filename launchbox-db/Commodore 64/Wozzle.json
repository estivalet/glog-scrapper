{"altername_name": [], "name": "Wozzle", "overview": "If you initially suspect small, cute doodle monsters behind this cute name, you will be taught better after the first few seconds of play. \"Wozzle\" is a pure thinking game that does not use other programs as a model. \"Wozzle\" is independent, brilliant and is characterized by an addiction factor that should not be underestimated. At the start of the game a playing field appears, the left half of which is randomly shuffled. The object of the game is now to restore this field to its original state, which is shown on the right-hand side. The individual stones can be rotated by clicking with the joystick, whereby all adjoining stones also rotate. But only if the stones really touch each other, i.e. if there is a connection between them.
