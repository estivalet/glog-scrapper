{"altername_name": [], "name": "Crossfire (Cosmos Designs)", "overview": "A shooter created by the Sommer brothers and released in 64'er 1994/03, 64'er 1998/12, and finally in 64'er 1999/12. The idea of our program of the month has been around for a few years. But with a new outfit and lots of opponents, you can go alone or in pairs into numerous labyrinths full of danger. Reaction and quick thumbs on the fire button are required! Wriggling little monsters make the mazes in \"Crossfire\" unsafe. The player must try to survive in a small satellite in this landscape. The small nimble opponents hide behind the wall blocks, come out from behind them at confusing intervals and start firing at the character. Only then does the player have the chance to shoot at the little villains with his own weapon.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Cosmos Designs", "publishers": "Markt & Technik", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSq7r_Trjgg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/95017-crossfire-cosmos-designs\n"}
