{"altername_name": [], "name": "Lazertech", "overview": "An action game, created by Terry L. Flynn and published in Loadstar #135. Bounce a beam off your computer opponent's ship or planet before he bounces you into oblivion. You and your computer opponent are provided with a ship that moves vertically within seven firing positions from which you will fire into crystals spread out at random between the two of you. Your lazer beam may be deflected at 90 degree angles according to where on the crystal you hit. The beam will continue until it hits something other than a crystal ... hopefully his ship or planet. If the lazer beam hits a block, the energy will be absorbed and no damage. It can take a few minutes to scan all the firing positions to find out which one will end up blowing his ship to space dust. The strategy is to imagine you beam shooting out and follow it as it is deflected by the crystals to see where it ends up. There is no time limit so you can ponder to your heart's content. But beware, your computer opponent will be doing the same!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Terry L.
