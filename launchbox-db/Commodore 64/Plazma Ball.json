{"altername_name": [], "name": "Plazma Ball", "overview": "Plazma Ball is a tactical, turn-based American Football game. Each team has 16 athletes (eleven on the field) and in each round, the player may move between zero and all of them. Other options are blocking another athlete or setting up a ball throw (if it is in possession). Before the match starts, both players also have the opportunity to set up their teams within an 50 yards radius. The outcomes of throwing attempts and fights between athletes are calculated from their statistics. The game is played within a league of four divisions (four teams each) and up to two players can take control over one team each.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Flair Software", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/124192-plazma-ball\n"}
