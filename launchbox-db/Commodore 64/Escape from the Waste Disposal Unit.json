{"altername_name": [], "name": "Escape from the Waste Disposal Unit", "overview": "Your mission was to go to a Galaxy to befriend an unfriendly race of aliens, but when you arrive in your spacecraft you are hurtled into a large waste disposal unit. Your new mission is to now go through various levels of garbage to escape the unit. The game is viewed on a single screen and you must emit a beam behind your craft and touch the garbage with it that are moving on the screen to get enough energy to move to the next level shown on a bar. You also have another energy bar and this decreases when you use your beam or you touch a piece of garbage and when it empties then it is game over. A Bin-Bug also trapped helps you by allowing you to touch it to increase your energy. Before the game starts you can make the garbage longer horizontally or vertically, or choose a level (1-5).", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Chris Stamp", "publishers": "Krypton Force", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIQ0E-tkqv8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/99512-escape-from-the-waste-disposal-unit\n"}
