Published in COMPUTE!'s Gazette 1986/02 (Issue #32). Like a bowl of alphabet soup, the \"Lexitron\" screen appears to be just a jumbled mass of letters. Can you find the ten hidden words before time runs out? If you enjoy the hidden word games often found in newspapers and magazines, you'll like \"Lexitron.\" But unlike the ones done with pencil and paper, Lexitron adds a few twists. There's 'a time limit, and you can select one of three difficulty levels.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "February 3, 1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ron Wilson", "publishers": "COMPUTE!
