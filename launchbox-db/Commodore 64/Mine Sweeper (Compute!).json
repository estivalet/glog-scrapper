{"altername_name": ["Strasdenian"], "name": "Mine Sweeper (Compute!)", "overview": "You'd think it was a \"minesweeper\" game by the title but its really a fast-paced and really tough shooter. Released as Strasdenian in Italy in International Games n.8 (settembre 1991). You are on patrol in the skies of Frekkel orbital station when aliens are spotted approaching. Thus begins your battle against the strange and menacing beings who want to conquer the world. You must fly (being careful not to hit the buildings) and destroy the aliens that appear on your dial with your laser cannon. You have to be very careful as they are very fast and often have unpredictable movements. At the end of the squadron of enemies you will have to face the Strasdenian support ship which is very powerful and must be hit many times to destroy. If you can get past the support ship make your way to a tougher level with a mothership at the end.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "July 3, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ben Campbell", "publishers": "COMPUTE!
