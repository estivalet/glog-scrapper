{"altername_name": [], "name": "Golf at the Tower", "overview": "Golf at the Tower is a Solitaire card game developed by Maurice Jones and published by Softdisk Publishing, Inc. in the disk magazine Loadstar. Issue #102. This game is the third in Marice Jones' second trilogy of playing-card solitaire games. At last you may shoot par! Golf at the Tower can be called an \"impossible\" solitaire game. It can be beaten but it is not likely anyone will do it more than a dozen times in a lifetime. That's why I've made this game to be played for score, rather than just for finished games. After all, in golf, does anyone realistically expect to score an 18 on an 18 hole golf-course? In this version, one simply plays to minimize the number of cards left, even when it is obvious that some will be left. There are strategies that can be employed at various stages of the round. And you can ask the number of cards left, to simplify some decisions. You can still play win-lost\\all-nothing if you prefer. Most solid players can get their game down to about a 77 pretty quickly.
