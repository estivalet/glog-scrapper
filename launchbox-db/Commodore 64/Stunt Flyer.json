{"altername_name": [], "name": "Stunt Flyer", "overview": "Stunt Flyer is a stunt-flying simulation for the Commodore 64. Gameplay puts the player in control of a small prop-plane at an airshow, where they attempt to perform a number of airplane-based stunts. There are two display modes, a 1st-person 3D mode where the player can attempt to fly their plane and perform stunts, and a side-scrolling 2D mode where the player can review the stunts they have performed. The player can attempt to recreate a total of 20 stunts, and are awarded a score based upon how closely they adhere to them, or can review an expert stunt flyer perform the stunts for tips. The player can also freestyle their own performance, and review this performance. While in 3D mode, the player can either use the keyboard or joystick to guide their flight, and the cockpit has a variety of gauges to help safely control stunts.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nice Ideas", "publishers": "Sierra On-Line", "genres": "Flight Simulator", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/123385-stunt-flyer\n"}
