{"altername_name": [], "name": "Power Surge", "overview": "A game, which I was too late for the 2001 Crap Game Compo, but I share this with you all. This was programmed in hardcore assembly language. The aim of the game is to guide your orb around the flashing maze and reach the exit before time runs out. If the player touches the flashing maze, it goes back to the start again. Tough, but possible to play - oh and crap as well. Well, it was meant to be crap anyway!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2001", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Richard Bayliss", "publishers": "The New Dimension (TND)", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/124306-power-surge\n"}
