{"altername_name": [], "name": "Deadline (Visualize Software)", "overview": "Deadline is one of those games you have to commit to. At first you'll die many times and end many games before you reach the next level. The object of the game is to save a number of scientists from war-torn planets. You have to scoop up the scientists from the water. While the scientist is onboard, he will show in your teleport monitors on the left and right. Your job is to blast away at the enemy and keep the scientist safe in your ship until he is teleported away. He will be able to teleport after you've defeated a certain number of ships so be aggressive. Multiple difficulty levels means more scientists to save.
