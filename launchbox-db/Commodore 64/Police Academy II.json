{"altername_name": [], "name": "Police Academy II", "overview": "Playing off the success of the movie franchise but not really being related to the movie, this is a set of minigames, a catch'em game where you catch bullets by blocking them with guns, a crosshairs pop-up shooter where you must only shoot the people who aren't police holding guns, with some accuracy target shooting thrown in for good measure. Then a mini game where you only catch the golden ammunition to determine how many shots you get back in the crosshairs shooter. The difficulty ramps up when characters you don't suspect draw guns on you and some other novel changes.
