{"altername_name": [], "name": "Counties", "overview": "A geography educational game created by Vince Apps and released in 1984 in the book \"40 Educational Games for the Commodore 64\". A few years ago the Government changed the names of most of the counties in England, Wales and Scotland. Some people still call them by their old names so we have come up with this program to help you make sure you know the new names and where they are. Your computer knows where Gwent is - do you? The computer will draw an outline map for you and give you a list of ten county names to choose from. The computer will then choose, at random, an area for you to identify. A flashing sign will indicate the area in question. Type in your answer in upper case (capitals). Tries and scores are shown on the screen. If you are wrong you can try again.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Vince Apps", "publishers": "Granada Publishing Ltd.", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/166589-counties\n"}
