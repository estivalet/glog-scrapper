{"altername_name": [], "name": "Carcrash", "overview": "Do you feel called to be a Formula 1 driver and, you can save money! This game simulates the entire race on the C64: In his Carcrash game, the aim is to drive through a race track full of snakes as quickly as possible without damaging your car or anything else. If you manage to do this for 40 seconds (this time can be very long), you will get to the next level as a reward. Here, to your delight, the obstacles are much closer together. If you think you can leave the road and move better on the relatively flat green strip, you are mistaken: your car will leave the screen with a loud bang and the game will be over.
