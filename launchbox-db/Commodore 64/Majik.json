Before he passes away, he holds on to the desperate hope that he will be united with his only son and heir, Prince Gideon, before he passes away. However, it is rumored that Gideon is being held captive in the evil clutches of Domir \u2013 for only Gideon himself can unite the Clans of the Reaches and prevent Dolmir's intended domination. Piradon, a great magician, has the task of rescuing Gideon, but accomplishing this task will be most difficult as his magical powers are limited in the lands he is about to journey. Majik is a first-person adventure where players must perform certain tasks in order to proceed through the game. The four arrow icons allow movement in any direction (N, S, E, or W), and can turn either white or red. If the icon is white, the player can travel in that direction, otherwise the icon is red. Next to the arrows is another icon, and selection this will present players with several verbs such as VIEW, LOOK, SEARCH, and SLEEP.
