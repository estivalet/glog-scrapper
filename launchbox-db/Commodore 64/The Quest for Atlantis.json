{"altername_name": ["The Sunken Atlantis", "Gyroship"], "name": "The Quest for Atlantis", "overview": "You are above the fabled city to carry out a very daring and dangerous mission: you must in fact recover some priceless platinum diamonds scattered along the underground walls of the undercity. You have to move with the utmost precision, so as not to hit the walls: the slightest contact and your spinning top will explode. Also pay attention to the defense lines prepared by the old ones before their escape from the planet: very powerful lasers, cannons hidden among the rocks, weights that fall along the way that can crush you, etc. Each rumble you recover will give you energy to continue your mission.
