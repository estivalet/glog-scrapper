{"altername_name": ["Gold Quest 6: Extended Version", "Gold Quest 6: Hex of the Seven Dragons: Extended Edition"], "name": "Gold Quest VI: Hex of the Seven Dragons: Extended Edition", "overview": "A 3D dungeon crawler where you play the role of a brave dwarven hero. In it you craft your own here and experience another adventure in the Kingdom of Roglia, the land of the dwarves. This adventure takes place in the Curious Dimor Mine, which is located deep in the south of the dwarf kingdom Roglia. Every dwarf knows that there are still vast amounts of gold pieces and gemstones in this old mine. When the dwarf people waged a war against the hungry ogres of Traublonia nearly 200 years ago, every weapons-capable dwarf was needed at the front, and there were no longer any smaller mines and guards left in Dimor. After the army of the small people was able to achieve a glorious victory in the legendary battle of Kharakon and thus ended the war, some of the invaders took up residence in these unguarded mines and it will be your job to expel them. In short, Gold Quest VI is all about accumulating as many points for the high score as possible. To this end, you must fight deeper and further into the veins of the mine and collect as much gold as possible. Finally, if you encounter the boss boss boss shaman or its dragon, you can take up the fight with him. If this is victorious, the curse is taken from the mine and Sledgie can be freed from captivity. The gold aprons of Roglia can resume their work and the player is included in the Great Book of Dwarven Heroes.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2022", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Thorsten Schreck", "publishers": "The New Dimension", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UxjpxjMeR8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/163286-gold-quest-vi-hex-of-the-seven-dragons-extended-edition\n"}
