{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bounder on the Rebound", "overview": "An updated version of the original Bounder game, with a few bugs fixed (but retaining the cheat modes of the original). Like the original you control a tennis ball that constantly bounces on the screen. The player has to move the ball around between two bounces so it lands on friendly areas like grass or the main hexagonal-patterned floor. If it lands on hazardous areas like spikes and sand, or hits the enemies which move around, one of the seven lives the player starts with is lost. There are beneficial squares though - arrows which keep the ball in the air longer or teleports which clear part of the game. This was officially released by Gremlin in the 10 Great Games compilation.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Andrew Green", "publishers": "Gremlin Graphics Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164914-bounder-on-the-rebound\n"}
