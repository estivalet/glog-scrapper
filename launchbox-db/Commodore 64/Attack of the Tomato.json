When you let six tomatoes pass across the left side (and eventually off the screen) of the screen, it's game over. This was a type in from the book \"Winning Games on the Commodore 64\" The German version was from the book \"Das gro\u00dfe Commodore-64-Spiele-Buch\" There is also an updated German version simply titled Tomato in 1986.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Steve W.
