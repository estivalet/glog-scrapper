{"altername_name": ["Planetoid"], "name": "Exceleron", "overview": "The war in the constellation of Vega has finally had catastrophic consequences for the onginarian inhabitants of the walls. Aliens have won and have reduced the entire population to slaves, working in underground mines. Unable to abide this massacre, the Empire has decided to send teams to bring Iberta back to the 7 planets. You are part of one of those groups of rescuers. You will need to do everything possible and use every ounce of power your Exceleron fighter-ship has available to defeat all that will be coming at you. But even if it feels like you are going to die, the trust the Vegans have in you should give you strength to continue. Work to collect the six pieces of shield from around the outside planets which will allow you to then go to the middle planet. If you get past that level then you will be allowed to take on the final confrontation on LEVEL 8.
