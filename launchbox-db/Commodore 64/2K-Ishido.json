{"altername_name": [], "name": "2K-Ishido", "overview": "2K-Ishido is a puzzle game which was developed by Andreas Schommer and published in 64'er 1992/10. This is a classic thinking game that has already driven many geniuses to despair. Although the rules are very simple, you need a sophisticated system to solve the game. It is a question of placing 72 stones in a playing field of 96 squares. It must be noted, however, that a new stone must always be placed next to an existing one. In addition, stones must be half in color and half in symbol. In addition, no stone may be adjacent that does not match at least color or symbol.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Andreas Schommer", "publishers": "Markt & Technik", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.46", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq39rwvSFd0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86416-2k-ishido\n"}
