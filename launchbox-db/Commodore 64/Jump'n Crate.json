{"altername_name": [], "name": "Jump'n Crate", "overview": "The objective of the game is to collect all the crates before the time runs out. The duration is decreased by time as well as collecting anti-crates (distorted ones) or getting hits by the robots and their bullets. However, collecting time capsules increase the time left (though not fully). If all 5 levels are completed, the time left provides extra points.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "May 2, 2023", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "", "developers": "metesev", "publishers": "", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/368516-jumpn-crate\n"}
