{"altername_name": ["Wizmax"], "name": "Wiz Max", "overview": "A single player SEUCK based game from Giuseppe Vollaro (Pinov Vox) with a holiday theme, released for the Halloween Game Dev Competition 2019. Something had gone bump in the night. Well, Halloween may be over, but there's one game which never got released yesterday, as it was to be first submitted to a Halloween C64 game development compo, run by DoubleSided games. This is a spooky, but fun arcade adventure, created with the Shoot Em Up Construction kit, called Wizmax. You play a magician's ball, which has to break a spell of an evil witch, which has raided the good magician's castle. She put the magician to sleep, and has sprayed power crystals in the rooms of the castle. Wizmax must eat those crystals, before getting caught by the evil ghosts, skeletons and other monsters. Then face the witch and destroy her to break the spell.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2019", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Chris Yates", "publishers": "The New Dimension (TND)", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/169666-wiz-max\n"}
