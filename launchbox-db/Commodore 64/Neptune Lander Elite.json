{"altername_name": [], "name": "Neptune Lander Elite", "overview": "Neptune Lander Elite is a pimped-up Lunar Lander clone, but don\u2019t make the word \u201cclone\u201d dissuade you from trying it out. Developed by C64 Mark with music by Phaze101, the game delivers the best Lander experience I\u2019ve seen in a long time (and I have created a Lander game myself). Not only do you have to ace the controls to land your ship safely on one of the platforms, but you also have to get around other dangers like dodging lasers, navigate through EMP zones (which will disable your thrust) and slide through moving doors. The game also offers power-ups that boost your fuel, ship and score. Another interesting option is the training mode, which introduces you to the game one step at a time, first starting with no landscape at all and slowly adding EMP, lasers, and so on. Neptune Lander is available on itch.io, using the model to name your own price, including free.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "November 6, 2020", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "C64 Mark", "publishers": "PhoenixWare", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOQq4fa8O5Q", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/143529-neptune-lander-elite\n"}
