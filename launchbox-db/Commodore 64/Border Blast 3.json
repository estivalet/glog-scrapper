{"altername_name": ["Border Blast III"], "name": "Border Blast 3", "overview": "The sequel to the games Border War (1989) and Border Blast 2 (1992) ... In the year 2035, the first Border War between China and the United States ended. During this conflict, the U.S. had erected a protective force-field barrier along its borders. This barrier had saved several American cities from being wiped out. Once the war was over and the Chinese Emperor brought down, the American people demanded that the force-field would be shut down. And so the world enjoyed 25 years of peace... Now, in the year 2060, a new tyrant rises. In a surprise attack, he seizes control of the old force-field barrier. The tyrant now uses the barrier to imprison the people of the United States WITHIN its borders. No one gets out, and no aircraft can pass through. A new Border War begins. The U.S. President requests help from the Air Force. This is where you (and perhaps a friend) come in... Your mission is to fly a powerful jet through different war zones in the United States. Destroy the enemy forces and bomb their bases. During some stages, the enemy will drop a nuclear warhead. Your only chance against an atomic blast is to find a safe spot in the shadow of a bunker. Collect power-up pods to amass points and earn bonus lives. Your ultimate target is the enemy\u2019s Mobile Command Center (MCC) \u2013 a flying fortress from which the tyrant controls the force-field barrier.
