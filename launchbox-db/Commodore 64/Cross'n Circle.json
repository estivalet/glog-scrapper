{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cross'n Circle", "overview": "As the name suggests, the game is about crosses and circles. We fly around the board and catch all the circles that appear. They come from the right side of the board. The difficulty for us here are the aforementioned crosses, placed flat at different distances from each other, in addition, the board is not too large, so a bit tight there. If we take the cross twice by mistake, then we lose life and fall down.
