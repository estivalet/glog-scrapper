{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mega64", "overview": "A faithful remake of Megamania for the C64 released for fun at Visionparty 2002. You control a spaceship at the bottom of the screen and need to defend yourself from numerous waves of attackers. But in this game, like in MegaMania, the attackers are much more bizarre than invading aliens. There are hamburgers, diamonds, steam irons, bow ties, space dice, and more! You need to earn points by destroying as many of these strange attackers as you can before your energy supply becomes depleted.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2002", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Marco Wienkoop", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/122188-mega64\n"}
