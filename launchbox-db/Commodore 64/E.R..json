{"altername_name": ["ER!", "ER! Emergency Room"], "name": "E.R.", "overview": "Published in the monthly digital magazine Loadstar. ER! is an emergency room simulator/text adventure. You play an intern doctor that is working night shift when patients start rolling in. Nobody to turn to, you have to treat the patients to the best of your abilities. The game is timed, or how the game puts it, \"if you wait too long, unfortunate things might happen to your patients!\". You need to learn your job fast as you need to give far more advanced commands than in most text adventures; for example it might be a good idea to \"check patient history\" and then \"give glucose\" to stabilize the patient enough to get her out of the ER.
