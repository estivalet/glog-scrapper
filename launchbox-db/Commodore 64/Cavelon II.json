{"altername_name": ["Excaliba"], "name": "Cavelon II", "overview": "Cavelon II is a sequel to Cavelon, and once again you must collect the door pieces to go to the next dungeon, and time is against you. When you have collected all the door pieces, you proceed to the next dungeon. This time though, other knights are not just your enemies. The Black Wizard will appear and release hazards such as birds and archers onto you. You can use ladders to get to other platforms. Also, you can jump over hazards, but not shoot them. If you're lucky, getting the Excalibur floating around will allow you to ride an unicorn, allowing you to easily avoid obstacles. When you are hit by an enemy, you lose a life. Lose all your lives, the game ends. The game was re-released by Mastertronic in 1985 under the name Excaliba.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jetsoft", "publishers": "Jetsoft", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WflSbGzcUqk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90393-cavelon-ii\n"}
