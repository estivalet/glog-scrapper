{"altername_name": ["ATV Simulator"], "name": "ATV: All Terrain Vehicle Simulator", "overview": "Viewed side on, and with a split screen 2-player option, this game simulated the then-new All Terrain Vehicles in an action-based way. The game features a succession of courses, which must be navigated in 30 seconds. You must run to the vehicle initially, and will also have to manually remount if you fall off - all costing you more precious time. Careful use of the wheelies and jumps is crucial to completion. Each hazard must be taken at the right speed, which you'll learn through experience.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Digital Persuasion", "publishers": "The Codemasters Software Company Limited", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.36", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATV_Simulator", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzP4xHZQSk8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/87641-atv-all-terrain-vehicle-simulator\n"}
