{"altername_name": ["CJ's 4"], "name": "CJ", "overview": "The game is a standard platform title, in which you can shoot peanuts at your enemies, or use bombs you collect. It stars you as CJ the elephant with your trusty umbrella. It was set to be released in 1993 by Codemasters but was unfinished. Since it has no maze levels it is a good starter CJ game as things are somewhat more straightforward.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Juned Wahab", "publishers": "Codemasters Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5AY8WbaGF8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90755-cj\n"}
