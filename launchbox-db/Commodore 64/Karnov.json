{"altername_name": [], "name": "Karnov", "overview": "The game puts the bulging-muscled, fire-breathing, ex-circus strongman east-Russian hero on a quest through nine different levels to search for treasures. However, between him and the treasures were several horrendous monsters, including sword wielding monks, djinn, foot hopping giant fish and ostrich-riding skeleton warriors. Players can make Karnov walk, jump and shoot his way through these levels and find special items that will help him on his way. He also can collect red orbs with which he can upgrade up to three fireballs at a time.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "July 1, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mr. Micro", "publishers": "Data East USA", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnov", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pLV8i0wUS8&t=233s", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6839-karnov\n"}
