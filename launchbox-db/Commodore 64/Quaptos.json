{"altername_name": [], "name": "Quaptos", "overview": "Quaptos is a puzzle board game. The goal of the game is to arrange an identical pattern in the second window. The screen is divided into two parts. The first window shows a pattern, which must be repeated in the second window. Every square brick has a digit on it - initially \"one\". Each placed next to it brick increases the number by one point. This is an unofficial conversion of a 1995 Amiga game of the same name, although the board layouts are slightly different.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1999", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Pawel Kopczynski", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/168291-quaptos\n"}
