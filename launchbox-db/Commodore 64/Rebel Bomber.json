{"altername_name": [], "name": "Rebel Bomber", "overview": "The object of the game is to destroy our alien enemy's cities. You must fly a space shuttle over their planet's surface and drop bombs on the cities on your route. Your computer will guide your craft over each city. All you have to do is release the bombs. To drop a bomb, press the fire button on either joystick or press F7. If you destroy the whole city then you get bonus points and a chance at the next target. Finish 10 cities to be a champion.
