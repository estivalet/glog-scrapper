{"altername_name": ["Antaeus", "Hunt Unit"], "name": "Alloyrun", "overview": "The world now depends on the supply of the electricity necessary for its survival from nuclear power plants, oil is nearly gone and is used only for plastic production. Precisely because of their importance, nuclear power plants are considered precious and monitored at all times so that no saboteur can infiltrate them and sabotage them or be ransomed from the corporate aristocracy. One such blackmailer is from the far away planet Vostron II, where some aliens are eager to impose a supremacy over the Earth. You goal as the Alloyrun Hunt Unit will consist in venturing into the enemy's lair and try to flush out all the opponents and eliminate them. This will demonstrate to the universe that Earth cannot be held ransom in this way.
