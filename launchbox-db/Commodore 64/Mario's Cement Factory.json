{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mario's Cement Factory", "overview": "Mario's Cement Factory is an unofficial Commodore 64 conversion of the classic Nintendo Game & Watch game of the same name. Made by hayesmaker in 2020. Gameplay: The player controls Mario working in a cement factory, where one has to make sure the cement carried from the top of the screen reaches one of the two concrete mixers on the lower corners of the screen safely. The cement can't go directly into the mixers though. It must first go through four tanks which Mario can open by activating levers. His task is to go back and forth between all four spots and release the concrete before anything is spilled. Failure to do so will result in dumping of said concrete on the truckers waiting to make their delivery. To reach the different levers Mario must travel between floors via elevators, which must be taken carefully to avoid Mario falling off. Game B is a harder version of the game. Controls: Joystick in Port 2 Left + Right Move Mario Fire to Operate Hopper Levers F3: In Title Screen or Game - Change border colour F7: Pause Use Keyboard to Enter a Highscore.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2020", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "hayesmaker64", "publishers": "itch.io", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdvkz5nl2Y", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/132986-marios-cement-factory\n"}
