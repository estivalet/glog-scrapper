{"altername_name": ["Super Droud", "Quake Minus 1", "Quake Minus 1"], "name": "Quake Minus One", "overview": "In the 1980s, the Western world constructed a large power plant named Titan under the Atlantic Ocean in order to extract geothermal energy from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge where the Earth's crust is thinnest. The power plant is operated and maintained solely by robots. Members of the Robot Liberation Front invade the power plant and seize control of the robots demanding equal rights for the machines, failing which they would use the power plant to trigger a massive earthquake which would severely threaten America, Europe and Africa. Titan is under the control of five separate computers - Zeus, Poseidon, Vulcan, Ares and Hermes and scientists have managed to regain control of Hermes and the robots it operates. It is up to these robots to regain control of the other four computers who are moving to regain control.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mike Singleton", "publishers": "Aackosoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.75", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_Minus_One", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm8btgCnjd8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109328-quake-minus-one\n"}
