{"altername_name": ["Magic Micro Mission"], "name": "The Magic Micro Mission", "overview": "TV-spin-off derived from the title sequence of the Central ITV series 'Magic Micro Mission' broadcast in six UK regions in 1983 and 1984. The first part is a simple cockpit-based shooter, with flying saucers zooming past on elliptical paths from bottom left to bottom right or vice versa. You aim to position cross-hair sights with the joystick to shoot these down as they go by. The second stage is a maze game similar to Pacman but set on a colourful circuit-board grid, with three 'chip' sprites moving freely around the maze and resistors moving up and down in four columns of the grid. You control a robot which must wipe up patches of 'oil' regularly distributed across the screen while avoiding the other moving components.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Simon N.
