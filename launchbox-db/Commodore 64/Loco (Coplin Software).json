{"altername_name": [], "name": "Loco (Coplin Software)", "overview": "You must do all the things at once! This is shown as a single player game, but both joysticks should be used as one set moves you and allows you to switch tracks to avoid oncoming trains and avoid bombs dropped by the planes while the other shoots smoke and steam to allow you to better avoid those hazards. All this while keeping an eye on the track layout below to get where you need to and keep fueled up. Perhaps two players playing cooperatively would be most successful.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nicholas Coplin", "publishers": "Coplin Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb3b-hmE7sQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/121555-loco-coplin-software\n"}
