{"altername_name": [], "name": "Rocky's Boots", "overview": "Rocky's Boots is a simple educational puzzle game where you can learn about logic circuits. You control a nondescript square, moving it about several rooms. Each room contains basic electronic parts like AND, OR and NOT gates, flip-flops, delays and clocks. You can pick these up and combine them to build simple or complex circuits. After a helpful tutorial, the task in the game is to build \"kicking\" machines: Objects of different colors move through an area and turn sensor outputs on and off. You now have to build a circuit that activates a kicking device which kicks the right objects out. When you do it just right, Rocky the raccoon dances a little jig to a joyful melody for you! The game also features an editor where you can build you very own kicking puzzle.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Leslie Grimm", "publishers": "The Learning Company", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky%27s_Boots", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Uj3ampWos", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/126304-rockys-boots\n"}
