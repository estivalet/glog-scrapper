{"altername_name": [], "name": "Breakin (NET Software)", "overview": "A strange and amusing Breakout variant. The Earth is being invaded by hostile creatures from outer space. The creatures are protected by a force field. Your mission is to break into the area behind the force field, and to destroy the creatures with deadly power dots. When your power dot hits the force field it will bounce back. You must use your deflector paddle to bounce the power dot back towards the creatures. Once you have destroyed the creatures, you will proceed to the next level, in which the creatures will advance faster!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Phil Bailey", "publishers": "NET Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCHCYt9BkgM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/146348-breakin-net-software\n"}
