{"altername_name": [], "name": "Break-Out", "overview": "A Breakout/Pong style game released in DatorMagazin 1988/12. Then it was time for a challenge again! This week, it's games like grids. You scoundrel, you should write a Break-Out! They are an old classic game that involves using a bouncing ball to remove as many tiles as possible at the top of the screen. The game has existed in many versions throughout the ages, most recently as Crack, Krak-out and Arkanoid. You control a small plate in the lower part of the screen with the help of which you hit the bouncing ball in the air, the plate is controlled sideways with the keys X and Z. When the ball hits a cradle, a tile, or the court, it must bounce in principle according to the laws of physics, i.e. the angle of incidence, output signal. However, a certain random factor can be added to the bounce to make the game better. So enjoy!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kjell Ericson", "publishers": "DatorMagazin", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90074-break-out\n"}
