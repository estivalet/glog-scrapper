{"altername_name": [], "name": "Quattro Combat", "overview": "The computer games collection 4 Quattro: Combat by the game company Codemasters Software Co. Ltd. was published in 1992. Arcade Flight Simulator: This arcade game allows you to know what it was like to fly different aircraft from different points in time. You can fly a bi-plane from WW1 over Germany, a WW2 plane over Pearl Harbour and a Fighter Plane in WW3. SAS Combat Simulator: This action game is similar to Konami\u2019s arcade game Green Beret. It scrolls from left to right, and the levels include ladders and platforms. A constant stream of enemies face you, and can be dispatched with either your machine gun, or one of your limited (but replenishable) supply of grenades. Ninja Massacre: Is a 1 or 2 player Gauntlet clone. As a ninja you must move around a maze collecting treasure, power-ups and killing all baddies. There are 50 levels to complete with a password after each one so you don't have to start at level one again. In 2 player mode both you and the other player play at the same time. Thunderbolt: Is set in the future and is about the war between humans and the planet Proxima. Both experiment with chronoclasm bombs which has the ability to destroy items from the future or past. Unfortunately a big accident during a trial run causes the space-time continuum to collapse. The immediate consequence for the player, manning a Thunderbolt jet fighter, is that he has to fight his way through enemies from different decades.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Amazing Games", "publishers": "Codemasters", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109621-quattro-combat\n"}
