{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bob Winner", "overview": "Bob Winner is searching for a lost civilisation somewhere in the desert, and has to gain three keys to access it by beating a boss in Paris, London, and New York respectively. The first two bosses are boxers, the last one is a gun-toting cowboy. The items necessary to beat the bosses are found on the preceding screens. Bob Winner is a side-view flip-screen action game with hand-to-hand combat sequences. The protagonist will often have to avoid rolling barrels and flying insects that try to impede his progress.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Loriciels", "publishers": "Loriciels", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/89057-bob-winner\n"}
