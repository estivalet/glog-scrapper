{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Dark Tower", "overview": "There was a bitter struggle between humans and Orcs. The \"Dark Lord\" was slain and the Orcs put to flight. Many of the Orcs split into small bands and spent their time roaming the countryside intent on pillaging and looting. One such band had attacked the monastery and stolen, amongst other religious artifacts, the legendary \"Golden Chalice\". They had then retired to the safety of the \"Dark Tower\", a secure citadel situated somewhere beyond the Shadow Mountain. They also took with them the leader of the unicorn herd and after subjecting the poor creature to barbaric treatment, turned it loose in the forest. One day the abbot sent for you and informed you that even though you were but a mere novice it had befallen you, as the youngest and the bravest, to seek out the Orcs and their infamous \"Dark Tower\" and to recover the the stolen items. You were also instructed to find the unicorn, as that would be your only means of returning to the monastery. The abbot and several of the monks accompanied you as far as the edge of the forest, but when an Orc archer was spotted amidst the trees they all turned tail and left you to your own resources... It's a rip roaring fantasy, text-adventure romp that should find its way into your collection as soon as possible!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jack A.
