{"altername_name": [], "name": "Alexander the Great", "overview": "Alexander the Great is a 2 - 6 player strategy text-based war game for multiple systems. Based upon the conquests of Alexander the Great, each player takes turns attacking different geographic areas to attempt to take control of the land. The player can only attack contiguous geographic locations. Each territory has individual strength, and each player individually determines how their attack strength will be determined. The strength of a player's attack or defense can be determined by a simple roll of dice, number transformation, or the transformation of a 5 letter word. With number transformation, the player is given a 3 digit number, and attempts to transform it into a different 3 digit number, by using a series of mostly randomly chosen math equations. With 5-letter words, the player must transform a 5-letter word into another by changing 1 or 2 letters at a time, changing into a new word each time. The player can define the number of transformation roles per turn.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Krell Software", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "6", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75239-alexander-the-great\n"}
