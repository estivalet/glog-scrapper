{"altername_name": [], "name": "Knight Lore", "overview": "Our hero must reach Melkhior, a somewhat eccentric wizard who is the only one who can save him. As with most Ultimate titles of the day, reaching him is a long and treacherous challenge, involving both puzzle-solving and action, meaning that each screen requires thorough planning and precise navigation. The game uses the isometric viewpoint in a manner similar to the later Head Over Heels, using monochrome but detailed graphics and techniques to avoid flickering sprites. The game lasts for 40 days and nights - at night your character turns into a werewolf. Ultimate's individual style of eschewing straightforward instructions in favor of feature lists and riddles is put to good use here, with the story detailed in a rhyming poem of sorts. The C64 version is actually a fanmade conversion and not an official port.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2018", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Rod & Emu", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.75", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_Lore", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCFHThI-zQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/114717-knight-lore\n"}
