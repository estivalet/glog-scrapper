{"altername_name": [], "name": "Moptown Parade", "overview": "One of the oldest releases by The Learning Company, Moptown Parade is an edutainment game aimed at teaching basic pattern recognition and logic skills to kids aged 4-7. The goal is simple: choose the traits of Moppet creatures to line up in a queue, obeying the given number of rules. For instance, if the rule says \"2,\" you must choose the traits of the next Moppet so that it differs from the previous Moppet by 2 traits, e.g. a fat, blue Moppet can stand next to a thin, red Moppet. The number of rules, i.e. traits, can be changed from 1 to 4, thus either making the game more or less challenging (although changing the traits to 4, the maximum, will just result in your Moppets being an alternate sequence of two types of Moppets).", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Leslie M.
