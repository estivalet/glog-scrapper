{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cris-Cros Poker", "overview": "A puzzle-poker game created by Louis K. Avanzi and published in Loadstar #049. Once you've played 10 hands of poker at once, you won't want to play the old way ever again! The game challenges your ability to plan ahead. 25 cards are dealt out one at a time in a 5x5 grid. Your job is to place them on the table so that the 10 poker hands produced (five across and five down) are the best you can make them. The value of each hand is shown on the instruction screen, better hands are worth more. You place them on the table by giving them a designation from A1 to E5 on the grid.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Louis K.
