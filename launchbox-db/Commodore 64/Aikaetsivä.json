{"altername_name": ["Aikaetsiva"], "name": "Aikaetsiv\u00e4", "overview": "In 1986, Tapanim\u00e4ki completed a text adventure game (in Finnish) inspired by Infocom's games called Aikaetsiv\u00e4 (Time Detective in English), for which Tampere-based Triosoft reserved publishing rights. The game was briefly mentioned in MikroBitti magazine in the \u201cCommodore insider\u201d column and was advertised with the slogan \u201cbuy a Finnish game!\u201d. However, the game was never released because the publisher did not consider the potential economic benefits to be covered even to cover marketing costs. In the amateur circles of Finnish text games and science fiction, Time Detective was well received, and it was even compared to a novel made into a game.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "", "developers": "jukka Tapanim\u00e4ki", "publishers": "Triosoft", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/130954-aikaetsiva\n"}
