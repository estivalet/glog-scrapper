{"altername_name": ["Kikstart II: The Construction Set"], "name": "Kikstart 2", "overview": "Based around the Kikstart TV show, the game allows you to recreate all those death-defying stunts in the comparative safety of your home. Viewed from the side, there are many hazards to avoid along the way. Some of these include steps to jump over, tyres and hedges to plough through at maximum speed, and mud which will slow you down. 24 courses are built in, and you can choose a set of 5 of these to race at a time, or let the computer choose them at random.
