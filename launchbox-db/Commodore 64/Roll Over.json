Described as a trip through many countries, on each screen or country you must navigate the shifting maze and get all the objects like smiley faces or light bulbs to move on to the next country/screen. As you go the shifting terrain becomes more and more difficult and you must choose your turns wisely. Additionally there is a timer and you can run out of time, so be sharp, or as sharp as a ball can be.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Thomas Koncina", "publishers": "CP Verlag", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7VBjxM_etE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/126306-roll-over\n"}
