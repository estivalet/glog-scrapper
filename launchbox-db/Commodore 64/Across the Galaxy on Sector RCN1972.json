I guess I should make a little story then. You have flown across the galaxy to find that a solar wind had pushed you off course. You find yourself in a very strange planet nearby known as Sector RCM1972. You can't find Earth, as you're literally lost in space. So you decide to fly across the galaxy on Sector RCM1972 to find out how close you are to a not so hostile home planet. Fly your ship carefully and blast those enemy ships to boost up your score.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2011", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Roberto Ricioppo", "publishers": "The New Dimension (TND)", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.62", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/124149-across-the-galaxy-on-sector-rcn1972\n"}
