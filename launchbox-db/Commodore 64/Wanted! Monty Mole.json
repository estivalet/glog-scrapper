{"altername_name": ["Monty Mole", "Wanted!: Monty Mole", "Wanted: Monty Mole"], "name": "Wanted! Monty Mole", "overview": "Monty Mole (also: Wanted! Monty Mole) is a jump'n'run game of the most difficult kind, that needed approx. 3 months of development. Starting in the garden, everything is full of perils. We collect pieces of coal and flee from evil boiled sweets, scurry under stampers at the right moment. Touching all the evil things quickly subtracts you energy. When all the energy is lost, the game ends. A \"box of worms\" fills up the used energy. Glittering protective shields give you a respite. The ways to die or respectively to lose energy points in this underground adventure game are manifold: toxic mine gas, flying poles, deadly hair spray, coal breakers (stampers), coal trolleys, coal conveyors (rotating saws), mine workers that throw helmets after you, acid baths, candles, bats, falling down from great heights, jumping, moving and falling items and animals etc. You can climb on ropes and trees. The numbers show into which direction you need to climb. Sometimes you also have to move levers. This happens automatically when passing them. You also need to take care of the floor dynamics, they occasionally disappear... A tin bucket and collecting pieces of coal each give you one point for the highscore, whereby there is a maximum of 13 points per level. When the energy is empty, then a R.I.P. appears before the options menu is shown again.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Antony Crowther", "publishers": "Gremlin Graphics Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.33", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanted:_Monty_Mole", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkTAbv_YYdQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/63117-wanted-monty-mole\n"}
