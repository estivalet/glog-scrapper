{"altername_name": [], "name": "Melonmania", "overview": "Melonmania is a side view horizontal scrolling game where the screen scrolls left or right when you move your hero, Mr Megafat, famous melon grower and TV personality. It is Midsummer Night and like every year, just as your melons have ripened. Melonmonsters appear to steal them in various patches scattered around the area. You must run around the area collecting 30 melons, one at a time to place them in your barrel outside your inventing hut before the night is over. As well as moving left or right, arrows appear on the ground either pointing up or down and using these allows you to move to another part of the area. As you run around the area you will encounter the monsters and these need to be shot as you can't jump over them, and if you touch one then your energy gauge is decreased. Not touching a monster increases the gauge but when it is empty then you lose one of four lives. You can fire forwards and diagonally upwards or downwards. If the moon in the nights sky reaches the right of the screen from the left then night is over and it is game over.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Karl H\u00f6rnell", "publishers": "Interceptor Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hadrn99L0Sw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/110536-melonmania\n"}
