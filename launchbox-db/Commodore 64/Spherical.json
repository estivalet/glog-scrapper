{"altername_name": [], "name": "Spherical", "overview": "Our hero must guide a ball through a level to the spot marked 'In', by creating and removing blocks to alter its path. The game is prevented from being a pure clone due to the ball, which moves automatically once activated, and can be controlled by using strategically-placed blocks. Simply reaching the ball usually involves modifying the level layout using these bricks. There are enemies moving on fixed paths which must be avoided, and bonus items to collect. Also watch for bonuses such as invincibility, gravity-alteration and teleporting. You take time to rotate, so the controls aren't truly immediate. The ball takes 20 seconds to start moving, so use this time to plan ahead.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Rainbow Arts Software GmbH", "publishers": "J\u00f6rn Galka", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih5Cnts1ix8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/31883-spherical\n"}
