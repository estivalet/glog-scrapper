The scientists who had been working on AI replacements to help the survivors of the atomic war have been killed by their latest model. One obsolete HEC-80 is our last hope. Control HEC-80 with joystick in either port. Go around each room, picking up objects (which will reappear) in order to solve a clue/obstacle in specific rooms. The objects are placed around each screen, and cannot be lost. Simply remember what they are, where they are and try to use what you have picked up using the fire button.
