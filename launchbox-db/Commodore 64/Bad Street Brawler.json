{"altername_name": ["Bop n Rumble", "Street Hassle", "Bop'n Rumble"], "name": "Bad Street Brawler", "overview": "You, the Underwear Man, just really want to go home unhurriedly from your boxing training . But obviously, everyone wants to beat you up today. This goes from people with bats over gorillas gone wild, dogs in need of love, bomb dropping midgets, 4 meter basket ball players, beer belly guys, karate fighters to crazy motorcyclists. You cannot put up with that and as you have just trained your square-shouldered, athletically built, brown(pink)-tanned body, you will show the inhabitants of Melbourne (that is where everything takes place). And you also have your special tricks up your sleeve. E.g. the \"squeezing\" of the ears, and the \"spinning around in the air\" of the opponent, etc. There is only one thing now: Punch your way through it!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Beam Software", "publishers": "Melbourne House", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.15", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Street_Brawler", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOsKrbqUeLk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/69337-bad-street-brawler\n"}
