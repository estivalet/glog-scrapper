{"altername_name": [], "name": "Fire-Drill", "overview": "Each mission is split into four levels: 1. As the fire chief you must wake your men to get to the exit. Do this quickly or they run back to bed, the cowards! 2. Drive the fire engine to the burning building whilst dodging debris on the road. 3. Two of your men must catch as many people as possible as they leap from the windows. Not always possible. 4. As the fire chief watches and the third man tends to the hose, the other two must put out the fire simultaneously. Game repeats and gets harder with each mission.
