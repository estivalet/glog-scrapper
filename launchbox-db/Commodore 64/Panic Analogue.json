{"altername_name": [], "name": "Panic Analogue", "overview": "Panic Analogue is an original paddle controlled game. It was initially submitted to the 2011 C64 16KB Cartridge Game Development Competition in which it received a third place. The objective of the game is to keep the main character named Redhead alive in the cave where he lives. Little Readhead survives by catching droplets of water and fireballs which are constantly falling from above. However, collecting water must be done with his mouth wide open while catching fireballs has to be done with his torch. Swapping between the two options is done by pressing the fire button. If water hits the torch or Redhead swallows a fireball he dies! If anything is dropped on the floor, redhead dies! Whenever you die, you restart one level down to make things easier again. Redhead is rewarded an extra life whenever he reaches 1000 points. If things gets too difficult, it\u2019s possible to hit F1 in order to enter \u2018jumbo mode\u2019 in which the size of the game character increases.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2011", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "H.
