{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pandora's Box", "overview": "According to ancient legend, all the evils of the world come from a box which Jupiter gave to a beautiful woman called Pandora. In this game you must prevent as many nasties as possible from leaving the box. Pandora must first blow onto a creepy as it reaches the top of the box. If the gust is on target and teh creature is at its largest size, it will be stunned and the colors on the sides will be fixed. Skillful puffs in the correct direction will float the pest onto the side of the box with the color that matches it and it will be exterminated. If bitten Pandora must drink the potion color that matches her face to get the correct antivenom.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "David Whittaker", "publishers": "Commodore", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sot3YoKxCBQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109104-pandoras-box\n"}
