In this fast-paced action game for the 64. You enter a strange new universe where your skill and cunning are put to the test. To survive, you must trap a constantly moving sphere before your time runs out \u2014 or you trap yourself. \"Trap\" takes you to another universe, another dimension. Trap's world consists of an array of colored blocks hanging in ink-black space, set against a blanket of distant, sparkling stars. Two beings inhabit this strange place, each with a geometrical form; a sphere, which continuously bounces from block to block, and a flat square, which lies atop the blocks, blinking patiently. In Trap, you're the blinking square, and your objective is to trap the bouncing sphere and use its kinetic energy for your survival.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "May 2, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Eric Haines", "publishers": "COMPUTE!
