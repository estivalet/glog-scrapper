It was developed by Peter Most and published by Chimera in 1985. An English translation was made in 2019 by the same coder and released for free. The actual in-game screenshots are in English on both versions, however, the Spanish release has a completely Spanish title screen. As for the game itself it's basically your typical underwater submarine game in which you have to collect treasure and avoid the walls and enemies such as giant octopuses. All the enemies are stationary.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Peter Most", "publishers": "Chimera", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_RCgQnwly4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/149519-ictinius-el-rescate-submarino\n"}
