Can you help the hapless European Space Agency astronauts evade capture in this multi-level disk-only game for the C64? You must survive the torture screen, negotiate the German factory in your captured ship, blast your way through an Operation Wolf inspired level, escape through the shaft, battle over the surface of the moon in a beautifully parallaxed scrolling shoot 'em up level and then punch and kick your way through the final beat'em up level. The game was initially PAL only, but NTSC support was added shortly after the first batch was sold.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "April 19, 2021", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Saul Cross", "publishers": "Psytronik Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFe29pgdg6Q", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161315-bad-moon-rising\n"}
