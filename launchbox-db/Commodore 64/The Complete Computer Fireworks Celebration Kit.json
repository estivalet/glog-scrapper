{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Complete Computer Fireworks Celebration Kit", "overview": "This one is a bit strange. In the mid 80's some scene releases and intros contained firework like effects that were really enjoyed. This developed into releases that were just simulated, music-backed fireworks displays that you could manipulate and eventually a couple of companies jumped on the bandwagon and created full published works around fireworks. Unfortunately, they could never quite compete with the best of the scene releases for music or display. Still, a fun oddity. The Complete Computer Fireworks Celebration Kit lets patriots create fireworks displays, add music and special messages, and turn their displays into computer greeting cards.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "June 10, 1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "John Van Ryzin", "publishers": "Activision", "genres": "Sandbox", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brsn7a7HTr0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75538-the-complete-computer-fireworks-celebration-kit\n"}
