Using the SnoopNet computer, players will comb the streets of the neighborhood looking for clues, and investigating people's houses while they're away. Speed is of the essence, as if your Snooper Troop is caught when the owner of the house returns home, you could be thrown off the case for good! The title encourages players to keep facts on people, map the neighborhood, review clues, receive special messages, and ultimately, find enough information to accuse and convict the criminal trying to chase the Kim family out their home.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Computer Learning Connection", "publishers": "Idealogic", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snooper_Troops", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSKUKOBal2w", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/112526-snooper-troops-case-1-the-granite-point-ghost\n"}
