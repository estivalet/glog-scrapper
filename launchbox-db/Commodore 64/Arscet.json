{"altername_name": [], "name": "Arscet", "overview": "ARSCET is the computer version of the well-known and popular game \"Kniffel\". Your C64 takes over all the annoying administrative tasks including. Rolling the dice, high-score list and keeping the points account over several rounds, so that up to half a dozen players can devote themselves entirely to the trick. The game is controlled by a joystick in port # 2. As many throws are made per game as there are lines on the board. The player whose turn it is is indicated by an arrow pointing at his column in the game board (just like the winner at the end of the game!). You have three attempts per throw. Use the joystick to select the cubes that you want to keep (red color) and confirm your entry by selecting the \"end symbol\" (ed). Try to fill in all fields with the highest possible score. After each throw you can choose a free field, except for those that are intended for accounting. 1 to 6: As many dice as possible must show the corresponding number. Double: 3 or 4 of the same good numbers are rolled are counted (the Total score!). Streets: There have to be 4 or 5 successive Au- numbers are rolled the. Full House: It has to be a 2 and a 3 double dice are rolled the. Kniffel: There must be 5 identical numbers are rolled the. Opportunity: All points count. If a player has achieved at least 63 points in lines 1 to 6, he will receive 35 bonus points at the end. The high-score list is constantly updated during the game and saved on disk. Have fun!
