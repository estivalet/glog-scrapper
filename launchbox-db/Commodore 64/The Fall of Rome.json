You have the chance to save the Empire by fighting off attacks or attacking your enemies around your various provinces over 12 turns. Each turn represents five years and is split into three phases, Income and Expenditure, Movement and finally Combat. In Income and Expenditure phase, you look at each province in turn and receive money from each Province with the amount of enemy tribes and armies in the area affecting the amount. You have the choice of converting your mobile legions into other troops or to move money into other Provinces. Movement has you moving your armies around the Provinces and when you have finished then the computer moves the enemies tribes and armies. Combat allows you to attack your enemies to keep them in order or to make their numbers smaller. Once all three phases have been completed you look at your various statistics before playing the three phases again for another five years.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Martin Edwardes", "publishers": "Argus Press Software", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/100277-the-fall-of-rome\n"}
