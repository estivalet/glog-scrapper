{"altername_name": ["Werner - Mach hin!"], "name": "Werner: Let's Go!", "overview": "Werner: Let's go! is based on the German comics character Werner and offers five mini games: - Meiern (also known as mia) is a dice game with an emphasis on bluffing. The basic rules: A player makes a hidden dice throw and checks the result. Then he gives the dice cup to the next player and says his result which may be true or a bluff (the said result needs to be higher than what the player before said). The next player either has the choice to throw the dice or to call a bluff. In the latter variant he opens up the dice cup and either the bluffer or the wrongful accuser gets a minus point. - A side-scrolling car drive in which the player has to avoid obstacles by accelerating or ducking. - Another car drive which is essentially the same with items which have to be picked up and used at the right time. The fourth game is about building a motorcycle. The player needs to choose between a variety of parts. This game is lost after twelve incorrect guesses. - A motorcycle drive where the camera is directly placed behind the motorcycle. The goal is to avoid obstacles.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Semmel Verlach", "publishers": "Ariolasoft UK", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "0.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/124040-werner-lets-go\n"}
