{"altername_name": [], "name": "Castle Raid!", "overview": "An action game by Paul Klemond and published in 1983. Defend the castle from the fierce raiders. The objective is to hurl rocks at guys trying to get in your castle. At the end of each stage, you are awarded a shield. At the end of the seventh stage, you are greeted by a princess. Possibly the first C64 game to feature speech, although it slows down things considerably.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Paul Klemond", "publishers": "AID (Advanced Integrated Development)", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YURbxW3Yj0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90365-castle-raid\n"}
