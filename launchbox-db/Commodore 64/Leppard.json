{"altername_name": [], "name": "Leppard", "overview": "An action game from Harald Sprung and published in Magic Disk 64 1996/01. Leppard is a diamond collecting robot. In order to get from one level to the next, he has to show twenty diamonds - not an easy task, since in addition to the sparkling stones there are also four malicious opponents in the labyrinth who only have one thing in mind: to touch Leppard so that he evaporated in a big green cloud. Leppard is controlled through a total of ten levels with one opponent, but he not only has the four villains already mentioned, but also a sometimes very tight time limit. In order to at least defend himself against the numerous opponents, Leppard can plant a bomb at the push of a button. However, this can only be done standing up. Who is able to release the fuse of such a dangerous object in a full sprint? However, you have to be particularly careful, because enemies that have been blown up will return to the field in a few moments!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Harald Sprung", "publishers": "CP Verlag", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/121508-leppard\n"}
