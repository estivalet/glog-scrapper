{"altername_name": [], "name": "Flying Feathers", "overview": "Flying Feathers is a side view single screen shooter where you are a warden in a boat on the bottom of the screen and you must protect the fish by shooting eagles. You control a cross-hair and you must use this to kill the birds as they come down the screen towards the water. You start with five fish to protect and if an eagle picks up a fish then you can still shoot the bird to drop the fish. After a certain time, a duck and her family swims across the screen to give you an extra fish. It is game over once all fish have been taken. For increased challenge, there are eight skill levels to select at the start of the game.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "T.
