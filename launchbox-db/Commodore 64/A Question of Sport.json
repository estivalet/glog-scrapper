{"altername_name": [], "name": "A Question of Sport", "overview": "This is the game of the long running BBC quiz show of the same name. Two teams of three battle against each other by answering sports questions. 2 Points are awarded for answering your question correctly. If you answer incorrectly the opposing team get a chance to answer it but for only 1 point. There are 6 rounds including picture board, what happened next and a quickfire buzzers round. Contestants are displayed as digitized faces and each contestant specialises in a certain sport. Team captains get to choose which sport they wish to specialise in from a choice of ten. There are 5 question blocks so that if questions start to repeat you can load the next one to extend gameplay life. After the last round the scores are totted up and the winner is the team with the most points.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "December 13, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Elite Systems", "publishers": "Elite Systems", "genres": "Quiz", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Question_of_Sport_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vJr9r9CI9k", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/108288-a-question-of-sport\n"}
