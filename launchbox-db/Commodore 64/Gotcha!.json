{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gotcha!", "overview": "The basic goal of Gotcha! is similar to Breakout: a ball gets bounced back and forth while vaporizing most blocks it hits and the goal of each level is to get rid of all viable blocks. But there are no paddles and the player controls the left-right movements of the automatically bouncing ball. Of course there are a few obstacles, e.g. coloured blocks (can only be vaporized if the colour of the ball matches), stationary skull blocks and moving enemies. The two latter are deadly at touch, but the skull blocks have the same behaviour as the coloured blocks. The game features 40 levels (the second half is unlocked after beating the first 20 which can be chosen freely), a two-player mode and a level editor.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Oliver Kirwa", "publishers": "Kingsoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/102627-gotcha\n"}
