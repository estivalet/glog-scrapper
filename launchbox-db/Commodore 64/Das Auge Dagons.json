{"altername_name": [], "name": "Das Auge Dagons", "overview": "A German language commercial text adventure homebrew released in 2009 by Eway10 Software and in C64 Retro Line Games No.05 and in Digital Talk #091 (15.03.2011). It was based in the H.P. Lovecraft world. We naturally became aware that this strange figure emerged at Miscatonic University in Arkham's Miscatonic University and demanded viewing the Necronomicon, a book full of demonology and unspeakable rites. He became very indignant when he was not handed over this forbidden book. \"Cthulhu will punish you,\" he shall have called after the librarian and disappeared. For years we have been researching the occult, supernatural and evil here in the area and with such \"special\" requests, we are immediately notified and go to the bottom of the matter. My research revealed that this man had a relic, also called \"The Eye of Dagon,\" and was apparently on a strange mission. I followed the trail of the stranger to the dark mountains on the Miscatonic River. The snake's pass, also a place of idol worship, would most likely be his goal... In your search for the man and his strange relic, you go to a remote village that does not necessarily receive you with its inhabitants. Explore the village and its inhabitants. Stay and find the eye of Dagons.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2009", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Eckhard Borkiet", "publishers": "Eway10 Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/367860-das-auge-dagons\n"}
