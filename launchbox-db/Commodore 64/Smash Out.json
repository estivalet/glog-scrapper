{"altername_name": ["Affronto"], "name": "Smash Out", "overview": "A pong\\airhockey type competition game where you make points by smashing the ball into the goal of your opponent. The call can be deviated by different objects in the field. The fire button will increase your speed but you have limited energy to strike a balance. Defend your goal while various beings wander around the screen, they can be destroyed in a hit but will unpredictably deflect the ball. A colored square may appear and hitting it can add some special effects such as immobilizing the opponent, allowing you to catch the ball, increase speed or reversing your controls!
