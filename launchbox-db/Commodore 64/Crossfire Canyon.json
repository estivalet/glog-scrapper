{"altername_name": [], "name": "Crossfire Canyon", "overview": "Crossfire Canyon is a 1-2 (NOT co-op) player arcade game for the Commodore 64. The player controls a small character who can move horizontally about the center of the level. On either side is an erupting volcano, from which creatures appear, and stack on top of each other. The creatures will shoot rocks at the character. If the character is hit, they lose a life. Otherwise, the player can pick up the missed rock, and throw it back at the creature. The strength of the thow is dependent upon how long the throw button is pressed. If a creature is struck, they are removed from the level. The player wins by clearing a level of creatures. The player starts with 3 lives, and it's game over when all are lost.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Utopia Software", "publishers": "BCI Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtube.com/watch?v=MQ8PfVg_U-c", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/159702-crossfire-canyon\n"}
