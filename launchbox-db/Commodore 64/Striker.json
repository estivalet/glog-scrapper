You can also play for European teams and play International football. Before each game you can train or speak to your agent about transfers or a better contract. The actual game views a goal area and goal with a clock ticking away and the score changing if a goal is scored. Occasionally you are able to take a shot at goal. A bar representing the angle of your shot keeps moving and you press the S key to stop the bar. You take a shot and hopefully you score. At the end of the game you get a managers report.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "A.
