{"altername_name": ["Gary Lineker's Super Skills"], "name": "Gary Lineker's SuperSkills", "overview": "Gary Linekers Superskills is a soccer game with a catch: it is only about the training! The player has to solve a sequence of mini games in a limited amount of time (overall). The mini games are divided into three basic categories: gym (button mashing), ball juggling (using moves with the right timing) and field event. The latter is also split into three succeeding disciplines: dribbling around obstacles, penalty and kicking the ball through hung up tyres. It is important to monitor the athlete's pulse rate and energy level which can be refreshed by either taking a rest or drinking. The game automatically does it for the player if the stats get too low, but it takes more time then. The game features three difficulty levels which can be assigned separately for each participant.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Wise Owl Software", "publishers": "Gremlin Graphics Software", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/101970-gary-linekers-superskills\n"}
