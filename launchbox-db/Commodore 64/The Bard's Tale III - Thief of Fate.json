{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Bard's Tale III: Thief of Fate", "overview": "The warriors who have destroyed the evil wizard Mangar receive a letter while celebrating their victory. The letter informs them of a terrible disaster: Mangar's master, the Mad God Tarjan, has unleashed his wrath upon the town of Skara Brae, completely destroying in. The heroes visit a refugee camp nearby and embark on a quest to defeat Tarjan. Thief of Fate is the third installment in the Bard's Tale series, and a sequel to The Destiny Knight. It is similar to its predecessors, being a first-person fantasy role-playing game in which the player explores maze-like pseudo-3D towns, dungeons, and wilderness areas. Two new character classes have been added: Geomancer and Chronomancer. There are more dungeons than in the previous games, and this installment also adds an auto-mapping feature. The game's world is divided into separate realms accessed by using time warps, each with its own theme and setting - including, among others, famous locations from Earth's history such as ancient Rome or Berlin during World War II.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Interplay Productions", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.02", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bard's_Tale_III:_Thief_of_Fate", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjCO7m9GRiU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/31834-the-bards-tale-iii-thief-of-fate\n"}
