{"altername_name": [], "name": "Magic Wood", "overview": "In this action game by Harald Furth, released in 2012, it is your task to collect mushrooms. Unfortunately, this is not easy. Attacking bats, a snake and a female wizard, who is firing dangerous lightnings, are trying to stop you. It is also possible that one of the mushrooms is poisonous. If you manage to survive all these dangers enemies will get more difficult and dangerous. Enemies will even become, after some time with unpredictable breaks, invisible! To make your life a little bit easier, you will be warned with an acoustic signal and a flashing symbol.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2012", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Harald Furth", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqGvAz06z8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/121704-magic-wood\n"}
