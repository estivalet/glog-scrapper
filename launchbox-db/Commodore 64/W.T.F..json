{"altername_name": ["WTF"], "name": "W.T.F.", "overview": "Warner Thomas Fahrenheit is a stupid ball. You have to help him and show the way to the goal (that blinking black box). Use your joystick and scroll the screen. Warner tries to follow. If you push the joystick longer Warner jumps higher. Small push means smaller jumps. Warner's favourite place is the center of the screen.
