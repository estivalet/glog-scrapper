{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dodo's Deep Doo-Doo", "overview": "Published in Commodore Free #076. It is the 17th century on the island of Mauritius and you are the last of the Dodos. Sailors carrying harpoons and blunderbusses are on the hunt and have set traps all over the island which you must traverse in order to find any eggs which may be stashed away. A map is shown at the start of each area to help you remember where they were hidden: Each dot on the mini map represents a pile of leaves or some other potential nesting site, the light dots are the locations which contain an egg whereas the black dots are empty or could even hold a trap. Also on your travels you may come across mounds of dirt, simply press fire on these and a dodo tree sapling will sprout from it, do this 4 times and you will gain an extra life, some are easier to find than others. Can you get to safety, avoiding booby traps and the elements with all of the eggs?", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2013", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Carl Mason", "publishers": "The New Dimension (TND)", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQrlDr3QvgE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75468-dodos-deep-doo-doo\n"}
