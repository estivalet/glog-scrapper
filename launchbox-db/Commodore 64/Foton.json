{"altername_name": ["Bosone"], "name": "Foton", "overview": "Important nuclear physics experiments using sub-atomic particles are taking place in an underground laboratory. More precisely, you have to direct a boson\\foton through many strange machines until it reaches until it reaches the target. The boson\\foton is reflected on particular revolving or semi-transparent mirrors that must be positioned in such a way that the reflections lead to the exit. To move an object you have to bring the flashing square over it and press the button. The mirror will be positioned sequentially in the various possible positions. You have to be very careful to avoid the boson\\foton hitting walls or other illegal parts as this would mean the end of the game. However, there is a time limit beyond which the boson\\foton becomes unstable and bursts, so.....hurry up! Published in Italy as Bosone in several releases including Hit Parade C64 n.66 (Aprile 1992) and Special Program n.83 (gennaio 1992).", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "2H/Trash", "publishers": "Edizioni Societ\u00e0 SIPE", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/PNxD3CjMpl0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/101561-foton\n"}
