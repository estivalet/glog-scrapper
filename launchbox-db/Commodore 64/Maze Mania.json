{"altername_name": [], "name": "Maze Mania", "overview": "Maze Mania is a Pac Man variant. Flippo, the protagonist, has to solve a number of mazes by turning all tiles into a certain colour. He has to walk over them to turn them, but some of them turn every time he walks over them and other ones only turn when approached from a certain direction. Of course there are also enemies which try to hinder Flippo's progress: every contact with them lowers his energy and when it reaches zero, a life is lost. Spread over the levels are power ups which either give an extra life, extra energy or allow Flippo to kill his enemies at contact for a limited amount of time. Flippo can jump over enemies and holes.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "GamesMan Software", "publishers": "Hewson Consultants", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SY_3hoyR0lQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/110521-maze-mania\n"}
