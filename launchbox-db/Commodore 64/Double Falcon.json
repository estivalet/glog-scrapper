{"altername_name": ["Fighting Falcon"], "name": "Double Falcon", "overview": "The airplane is a machine created to take you on a journey away from the earth to soar and sweep and then return. But anything that can fly can be brought back down in less graceful ways, so beware and take to war against enemy bases or adversaries in flight. Engage in duels with opposing aircraft flown by whoever you can get to pick up the other joystick, one player on the upper frame with the other on the lower frame...but who will win over all!? Various difficulty levels can be chosen for higher scoring evaluations.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Marcel Boosten", "publishers": "Digital Marketing Corporation", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hYqSpODX5U", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/97368-double-falcon\n"}
