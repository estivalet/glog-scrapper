{"altername_name": [], "name": "Quattro Fighters", "overview": "The fourth volume of Codemasters Quattro compilation series contains the following four games: SAS Combat Simulator: This action game is similar to Konami\u2019s arcade game Green Beret. It scrolls from left to right, and the levels include ladders and platforms. A constant stream of enemies face you, and can be dispatched with either your machine gun, or one of your limited (but replenishable) supply of grenades. Kamikaze: Is 2D vertical scrolling shoot'em up, very similar to Flying Shark. The player is pilot of fighter, he has 6 lives. His mission is to destroy enemy forces. He flies forward over military bases and shoots to all enemies - other planes, tanks, trucks etc. His plane has cannon with unlimited ammo and several bombs (4 on start) to clean the screen from enemies. Some destroyed enemies drop power-ups. Sometimes he fights against bigger enemy. Game has coop multi-player mode to 2 players. MiG-29 Soviet Fighter: The closest comparison to this action game would be Afterburner, a game which was overdue a decent home computer re-creation. You view the game slightly behind your plane, which must shoot out enemy planes, tanks and installations while avoiding their fire. Freddy Hardest in South Manhattan: In the future NYC has become inhospitable and depraved, with thugs lining every street waiting to pounce on ordinary civilians. Thankfully Freddy Hardest is on hand to face up to the baseball bats and knives, in a side-scrolling beat 'em up game.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Codemasters", "publishers": "Codemasters", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109627-quattro-fighters\n"}
