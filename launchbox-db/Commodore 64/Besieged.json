{"altername_name": ["Spellbound: Besieged", "Belegerd!"], "name": "Besieged", "overview": "An educational game and part of the Sulis Software Besieged series. Together, they pull together every quirk of English spelling you'll ever need to know - and keep you spellbound, time after time. Get right, once and for all, these impossible words: from asthma to ancillary, from miscellaneous to misspell. Can you get your crusading knight across the ravine to relieve the beleaguered city - or will the infidels get there first? Every word spelt right is a safe crossing for one of your knights. Spell a word wrong, and the infidels will have an advantage over you.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "C.P.
