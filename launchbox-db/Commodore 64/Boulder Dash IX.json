{"altername_name": ["Boulder Dash 9", "Boulder Dash 09", "Rocco"], "name": "Boulder Dash IX", "overview": "Rocco, the likeable protagonist of this game, must recover all the diamonds found in the Protocon mine. The collection of gems is very dangerous as the mine has been abandoned for centuries and is subject to landslides produced by every slight movement. The quarries of the mine are populated by strange forms of life: the prolific green amoebas and the frenetic butterflies. These beings, with particular precautions, can be transformed into precious diamonds. Amoebas must be surrounded by boulders to prevent their continuous development while butterflies must be crushed with boulders. Beware of the terrible and deadly electric quadropolises that, once released from their cells will chase and try to disintegrate you. The reaches of the mine can be yours, but it will not be easy.
