{"altername_name": [], "name": "Codename Desert Storm", "overview": "The game was intended for release by Players in 1991 time, and was a sort of Choplifter game where you had to rescue Sadam\u2019s human hostages. However, the war kicked off and the name had to be changed from its original name of Codename Desert Shield, to Codename Desert Storm. The hostages also were changed to downed airmen. Duncan suggested that the game would have been based on the Cobra Force game that he wrote for Players Premier. Because of the war and ties, Players got cold feet and didn\u2019t publish the title \u2013 despite the game being fully completed and with the changes.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Duncan Scott Kershaw", "publishers": "Players Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90806-codename-desert-storm\n"}
