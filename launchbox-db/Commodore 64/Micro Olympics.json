{"altername_name": ["Olympic Spectacular"], "name": "Micro Olympics", "overview": "Eleven Track 'N' Field style events are recreated in this joystick-waggling based game. Five are simple running events of different distances ranging from 100 meters to 1500 meters. Unlike Daley Thompson's Decathlon the longer events don't involve a different technique, or different performance measurements, making the 1500m quite tiring. There are also three throwing events (Javelin, Discus and Hammer), and the High / Long / Triple Jump events. Each event has a pre-defined world record to chase.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Database Publications", "publishers": "A&F Software", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Olympics", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/89113-micro-olympics\n"}
