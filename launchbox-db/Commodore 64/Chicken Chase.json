{"altername_name": ["Hyper-Hen", "HyperHen"], "name": "Chicken Chase", "overview": "A maze chase style game sold on cassette only by Nibbles & Bits, Inc from their Orcutt California office. In it, you are a hyper hen, running around a maze, eating corn scattered along the corridors, Chicken Chase adds to the challenge in the form of Gompeys, birdlike creatures that cruise the board from top to bottom at regular intervals. Adding to the fun are coyote boxes. At several spots on the maze one of these critters is penned up, depending on the level you've reached, one or more of them will be released when you pass its cage. Since coyotes like to eat chickens, this is another problem to avoid. They also cruise the side roads, so you'll need a new hiding plays from the Gompeys when a coyote is nearby. Each level completed lets a few more coyotes loose and things go a bit faster.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Corkey Wood", "publishers": "Gremlin Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJAmywCby6U", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75532-chicken-chase\n"}
