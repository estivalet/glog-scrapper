{"altername_name": [], "name": "Chopper 1", "overview": "Attack chopper vs the aliens. This shooter was created by Mike Sedore and published in COMPUTE!'s Gazette 1986/08 (Issue #38), and much later re-published in GO64! 2003/01. Only quick maneuvering and accurate firing can save the day in this fast-action, arcade-style game. As the sole trained pilot for the army's top-secret \"Chopper 1,\" an attack helicopter equipped with a powerful pulse laser, you're sent to defend your city when it's suddenly invaded by aliens. The city's other defense is a glowing force field which hovers above the skyline. The alien's spaceship passes back and forth over the city while continually dropping bombs which gradually blast their way through the force field and, eventually, into the city itself. The bombs will also destroy your chopper if contact is made. You've been sent to destroy the bombs with Chopper I's laser before they reach the city. The alien's spacecraft is made of an indestructible alien alloy, and it's invulnerable to your laser blasts. It will, however, destroy you if you get in its path.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "August 1, 1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mike Sedore", "publishers": "COMPUTE!
