{"altername_name": ["Mouse Trap"], "name": "Mouse Quest", "overview": "This platform game challenges you to guide a mouse around a screen collecting goodies - varying from cheese to cakes to balloons. You will have to jump over flowers, dodge bouncing balls, dinosaurs and dinosaurs amongst other things - contact with any of these loses a life. Movement is achieved along ledges, via clouds, moving platforms and up ladders. Short falls can be withstood, but larger ones (or heavy landings from jumps) are fatal. Once they have all been collected you must reach the door, doing all of this within the time limit, depicted by a picture of a diffusing bomb.
