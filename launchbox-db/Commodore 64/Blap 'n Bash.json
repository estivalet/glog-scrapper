{"altername_name": [], "name": "Blap 'n Bash", "overview": "You are an alien, who has been captured and you are now trapped in a space cell. You want to escape, but in order to do this, you need to complete a task. That particular task is to simply blap the ball with your spacebat and clear each intergalactic zone from all of the bricks. Simply by bashing at them. Aliens will appear and are pretty much helpful. Watch out for the red zone. Should the ball hit a red zone, a shield will be lost. Once all shields are down, a life will be lost. Bonuses will be scored with any remaining shields left after level completion. Collect power ups, and have loads of fun.
