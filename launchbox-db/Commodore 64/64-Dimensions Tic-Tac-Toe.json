{"altername_name": [], "name": "64-Dimensions Tic-Tac-Toe", "overview": "A placement game played on the 64 positions in a 3D board with four levels and a four-by-four grid on each level. The object is to get four in a row, whether on one level or between all four levels, straight or diagonal. It is essentially a Tic-Tac-Toe game in a 4x4x4 cube. The cube needs to be emptied before start. Each player choose a color of their pieces and take turn to place their pieces in vacant positions, one piece at a time. The player wins who first gets four in a row of his own pieces - either horizontal, vertical or diagonal. A player cannot remove or replace pieces that have already been placed. If all positions are occupied without anyone having four in a row, then the game is called a tie.
