{"altername_name": [], "name": "Guzzler", "overview": "You are Greedy Guzzler and your task is to move about various top view mazes shown on the whole screen to collect keys which will enable you to open a food cell and eat all the food in it. Once you have cleared a food cell you become fat and you are unable to move through thin gaps in the maze. Moving about the border of the maze is Deflator Dennis and when you touch him then you are thin again. Touch him while thin though and you lose a life. Moving about the maze are Frobbies and if you touch one then you also lose a life but you are armed with a limited number of bombs to place and kill them which can also kill yourself. After four food cells are cleared then Bonus Barry runs around the maze with a letter and if you collect all the letters you spell Guzzler and receive a bonus. Barry can also die if touched by Dennis.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jason Benham", "publishers": "Interceptor Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7OUeXn2I1s", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/103090-guzzler\n"}
