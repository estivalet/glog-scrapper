There are seven skill levels, which determine the quality of the player's team - alternatively each player's abilities specifically can be typed in. The player can also import saved squads from the same company's Premier 2, as the systems used in both games are identical. Before each match the player is shown each team's Goal Scoring Ability, which gives him some idea of how a match is likely to unfold. Full European rules on disciplinary points are included, as are away goals and penalty shoot-outs to decide ties which are level after the 2 matches.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "E&J Software", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/99761-european-ii\n"}
