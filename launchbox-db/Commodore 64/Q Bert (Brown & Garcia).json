{"altername_name": [], "name": "Q*Bert (Brown & Garcia)", "overview": "A somewhat unfinished-seeming alternative version by Phill Brown and Anthony Garcia of the Q*bert game. The pyramid there is very small dimensioned, the controls are like in the arcade original and the level order seems to be completely arbitrary (in round 3 it gets easier than in round 2). The collision query needs some work and from round 3 it goes totally nuts and gets quite difficult to play, so that one cannot say if there are more enemies than the ball at all (only Sam is announced on the title menu). To make matters worse there is no denying by any stretch of the imagination that there is a resemblance of the player sprite to a male sexual organ in this version.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Anthony Garcia", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/130614-qbert-brown-garcia\n"}
