{"altername_name": ["Wooden Ships and Iron Men"], "name": "Wooden Ships & Iron Men", "overview": "We have not yet begun to fight! The crash of the broadside mingles with the rattle of rigging. The first lieutenant echoes the captain's orders as two frigates swing together on a collision course that will leave one a dismasted hulk under a prize crew. At stake was more than ships and men: the ancient empire of Spain, the rugged British Empire and revolutionary United States and France were locked in a contest that would shape the course of future events. Wooden Ships and Iron Men brings to life teh tactical maneuver and combat in the age of fighting sail. Sailing again is John Paul Jones on the Bonhomme Richard, Admiral Nelson on the H.M.S. Victory, and Lawrence of the Chesapeake. Withe the simultaneous movement system, the outcome of each turn is uncertain as captains strive to gain the wind advantage and cross the enemy's line.
