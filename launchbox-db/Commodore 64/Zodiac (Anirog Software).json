{"altername_name": [], "name": "Zodiac (Anirog Software)", "overview": "Zodiac is an action game played from a top-down perspective similar to Shamus or Berzerk. A coven of black magic masters has gained terrifying powers after removing the Signs of the Zodiac from the Time Vaults, leading to great confusion. The Signs of the Zodiac are guarded by demons, and a lethal force field flows along the walls of the corridors. The player's objective is to kill the demons and recover the twelve signs and return them to the time vaults. There are four hundred corridors in total and enemies are continually multiplying. Any contact with either demons or walls will lead to a loss of life. Being on the move is important, as it is not possible to shoot while standing still. Once all the signs have been collected, the player will face Jemon, the most powerful of all the demons.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jeff Gamon", "publishers": "Anirog Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgF1FNAdzVg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109685-zodiac-anirog-software\n"}
