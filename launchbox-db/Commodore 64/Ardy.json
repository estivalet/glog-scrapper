{"altername_name": ["Ardy the Aardvark"], "name": "Ardy", "overview": "Ardy the Aardvark is a maze-game inspired by, and a near clone of, the arcade game Anteater. The player navigates the tongue of the animal as it moves through an underground maze. The objective is to eat drops of food lying underground while trying to evade worms, stinging ants and spiders. While the worms can pass through the tongue and only cause aardvark\u2019s death when being directly in touch with his tip of the tongue, other critters will instantly kill the player upon touching any part of the tongue. The lowest levels of the underground area usually have two special objects which clear out the whole screen from enemies if touched by Ardy\u2019s tongue.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jay Ford", "publishers": "Datamost, Inc.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.58", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlFHeY0vmuo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40384-ardy\n"}
