{"altername_name": [], "name": "Avon", "overview": "Avon is an unofficial conversion of a text adventure that was released on several computers back in the 80s, such as the BBC Micro, Spectrum, and MS-DOS based computers. It was never officially released on the Commodore 64. The game was made with Infocom's Zcode engine. The game was converted to run on the C64 by an unknown person in 2021 using the online zcode compiler, Ozmoo Online, which essentially just makes it a ROM hack. Game description: Avon is an appropriately Shakespearean adventure which beings innocently enough, with a sight-seeing visit to the celebrated playwright's hometown. As the protagonist explores the streets and souvenir shops, certain people, animals and objects begin exhibiting strange behavior; finally, the surroundings become completely unfamiliar, and the inhabitants' English unusually rich and poetic... the stage is set for an exploration of this strange land, in an attempt to find a way out. The happenings take place over three different calendar dates; the game world is a blend of places and characters from Shakespeare's plays, but as the authors reassure us, \"an exhaustive knowledge of the Shakespearean Canon is not necessary\".", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2021", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jonathan R.
