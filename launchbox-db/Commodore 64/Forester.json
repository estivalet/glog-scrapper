{"altername_name": [], "name": "Forester", "overview": "You are the Forester Robin and you must save the forest from dying. The evil witch that lives in your forest has cast a spell on all the leaves of the trees in your forest. Now all the leaves are brown and it is your task to color them green again. Normally this would be simple but the evil witch has also cast a spell on all the woodland animals, sending them after you. So you had better watch out! Good luck!
