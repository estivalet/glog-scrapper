{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tic Tac Show", "overview": "Tic Tac Show is a 2 - player trivia game for multiple systems. Designed to play like a trivia game show, two human opponents or one human and one computer opponent can square off against each other. Players take turns choosing a square on the board, and if they answer the question correctly, they get the spot. If they answer incorrectly, their opponent gets the spot. The first person to acquire 3-in-a-row wins the game. If nobody gets 3-in-a-row, then the player who has the most spots wins. There is a wild card spot hidden on each board, which does not require answering a question. Players can create their own trivia topics and questions, and add them to the game.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Advanced Ideas", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/132625-tic-tac-show\n"}
