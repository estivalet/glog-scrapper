{"altername_name": [], "name": "Deadline (CW Communications)", "overview": "RUN 1984/08 (Issue #8); Blast Off with BASIC Games for Your Commodore 64. In Deadline, you must accumulate 500 points before your opponent. The computer selects a random number from 100 to 599, but you won't know which number. If your intuition or computer ESP gives you a clue, you'll be far ahead of the game. The computer then will begin counting off the numbers from 1 to its random choice on the screen. You may stop the count at any time by pressing any key, but the goal is to wail as long as possible. Hitting a key too soon can be disastrous. Waiting too long is worse. The number could be 580 or 1 14. Scoring is fairly simple. If the computer chose 365 and reaches that number before you've pressed a key, then 365 will be subtracted from your score. Why not just press a key too soon and collect a modest number of points? Not so simple. The computer always subtracts the number of points it has yet to display from the number of points it has already displayed. So, if you press too soon, you might get a negative score.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "David D.
