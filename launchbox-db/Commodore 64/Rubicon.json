Radioactivity was spread over an area of 300 square miles with a radiation value of 1230000 rad. The Soviet Union and Finland were evacuated immediately. Months later terrifying mutations of animals were discovered in the area where radiation had spread. The only survivor tells us, \"These creatures were beyond recognition, but seemed to possess the intelligence of mankind.\" It is your mission to disarm the nuclear weapons before one of the mutations starts using them. Good luck.
