{"altername_name": [], "name": "Lazer Duel", "overview": "Lazer Duel isn't just your typical tank combat game where you face a second player. Instead, unlike most of those games, there is a single player option in which you play against an AI opponent. But that's not the only difference. As this game also has puzzle elements. The objective is to line up your tank and fire, causing your lazer to rebound off of diamond shapes that hopefully destroy your opponent. Sometimes they hit a bonus item giving you either points or an extra tank. Other times you may accidentally hit yourself!
