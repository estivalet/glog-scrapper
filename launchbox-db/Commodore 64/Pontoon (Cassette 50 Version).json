{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pontoon (Cassette 50 Version)", "overview": "A game of the notorious \"Cassette 50\" collection. Pontoon is a British blackjack variant. This one is presented completely in text without any graphics at all. The goal is to get closest to 21 in five cards or less. With less cards scoring higher, with the exception of having five cards and still being less than 21 being scored a bit higher, so something like Blackjack or Spanish 21 with some variation for spice. I'd just like to say, I hope this was ported from a PET game because the C64 was debatably the best graphics and sound machine around at the time and this is all text. The C64 even has build in characters for all the card suits but they were not used.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Cascade Games", "publishers": "Cascade Games", "genres": "Casino", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AF_ak51eIhA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/76048-pontoon-cassette-50-version\n"}
