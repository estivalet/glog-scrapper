{"altername_name": [], "name": "Drink & Drown", "overview": "A nightlife simulator, this game sees the player trying to impress his mates and the ladies while conserving enough money to let the alcohol continue flowing freely (but not so freely that he throws up on his shoes (too often) and blacks out) as he staggers from bar to bar. The primary factor influencing this status is selecting the correct (or often arbitrarily least-inappropriate) answer from a list of multiple-choice options to engage a given situation; points can also be won by stumbling across the bonus mixed drink order or managing to fire off the randomly-determined ultimate compound obscenity. It is not clear where the drowning comes into play, but the game makes up for it by offering extra opportunities for drinking at every turn. (Perhaps one drowns in the drinks?)", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "P.
