{"altername_name": ["Harrier Attack"], "name": "Harrier Attack!", "overview": "Harrier Attack is viewed from the side, and instantly resembles titles such as Wings of Fury and Jetstrike. You're on board of a Harrier and must reach the enemy island, destroying planes and ground installations as you go, then destroy their base and fly back to yours. Your Harrier is armed with both bombs and a gun. You must be careful not to fly at full speed throughout your journey as fuel is limited. There are 5 difficulty levels - the latter ones increase the volume and pace of the enemy, and add more mountains to avoid. The difficulty level also affects how quickly enemy aircraft appear on your radar.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "John Parkinson", "publishers": "Durell Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrier_Attack", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nu_zIXiuZBs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/104323-harrier-attack\n"}
