{"altername_name": [], "name": "JumpJets", "overview": "JumpJets is a nicely done isometric-viewed shoot 'em up, reminiscent of Zaxxon but in a more open environment. You fly over the isles of the sea taking out fuel tanks, choppers, planes and even patrol boats that protect the seas between the islands. If you can make it past the first stage you can plan your refuel and rearmament landing on the carrier, but you must have nerves of steel and catlike reflexes to land your jet and get back into the fight.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Martin Thomson", "publishers": "Supernova*Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZdSmfzjqXU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/107326-jumpjets\n"}
