{"altername_name": [], "name": "Vengeance", "overview": "Once again your Galaxy is under attack and you, the pilot of a lone ship, must go forth and battle these aliens and send them packing. As you progress against the enemy, pods can be collected to enhance your ship. These include speed, firepower, extra lives and energy. The last thing you can collect is a droid to teleport aboard enemy ships. When you collect this then pressing the space bar will bring up a menu. Select board ship and a cursor will appear and you select the enemy vessel. You guide the droid around looking for an engine section. When all eight sections are found on eight different ships then you have completed your mission. Vengeance is a vertically top down scrolling shoot-em-up and a 3D maze game. You use the joystick to control the ship or droid and your fire button shoots your weapon. Your score and lives can also be seen. Also released in Commodore Format 1994/02 (Issue #41).", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Finlay Munro", "publishers": "CRL (Computer Rentals Limited)", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0XHjo9toHE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113815-vengeance\n"}
