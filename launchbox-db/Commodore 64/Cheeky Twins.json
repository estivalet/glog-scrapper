{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cheeky Twins", "overview": "On the planet Xnyl live all \"Jams\" in peace and harmony. One reason is that on Xnyl, nobody has to work because the Jams live on air and love and they need a lot of both. Love isn't a problem as they do it themselves but the Jams have not enough air to survive the next few years. That's why two Jams named Pin and Ball have invented an atmosphere machine which needs tons of diamonds to produce fresh air. Sor far - so good. The problem is: at Xnyl are no diamonds. You can look wherever you want but you will never find a diamond! But Pin and Ball are not stupid so they build a spaceship to look for diamonds in the Galaxy and in short order they found planet Alpha Seven which was without any life but full of diamonds. They may have gotten a bit overzealous and filled thier poor craft far too full and exploded over earth infecting the animals with radioactivity and creating mutants. Now Pin and Ball must recover the diamonds and use the vitamin-catapult weapon to help them. Help the Jams survive.
