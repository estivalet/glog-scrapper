{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hotshot (dilithium Press)", "overview": "From the book \"Mind Moves - Strategy Brain Games for the Commodore 64\". Hotshot brings the challenging action game of billiards to your living room (or wherever your computer happens to be). You have free reign at the billiards table, complete control over each shot\u2019s direction and speed. Compete against a friend, the computer, or just practice by yourself. Game parameters can be freely adjusted to match your level of skill. Now please don\u2019t confuse billiards with the game of pool. Pool (more formally known as pocket billiards) is played on a table with pockets, usually with 16 balls. The more elegant game of billiards uses only three balls and no pockets. The objective in billiards is to strike your cue ball and have it hit each of the other two balls. Carefully planned geometric shots must be executed. In HOTSHOT, you choose among several variants of billiards, including the difficult three-cushion billiards. Dynamic color graphics are used to display the excitement of the moving balls and their collisions. Eager for success, you plan each shot then watch it unfold. And, of course, you can make trick shots. After all, what\u2019s a game of billiards without trick shots? You can put various types of spin, or English, on your cue ball to cause special effects \u2014 just what\u2019s needed for those tough shots you seem to face so often. OK, hustler, it\u2019s your shot!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Phil Feldman", "publishers": "Dilithium Press Software", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/105570-hotshot-dilithium-press\n"}
