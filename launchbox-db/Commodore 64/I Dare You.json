{"altername_name": [], "name": "I Dare You", "overview": "At the local meet of the Birmingham Adventure Players Society you discussed the usual adventure related topics as you always do at these meetings. \"What I would like is to play a REAL adventure!\" Lizzie, your best friend, said, \"Really? Well maybe we can fix that!\" she smiled, her usual sarcastic grin spread across her face. \"Ya! I believe that when I see it!\" you replied. \"My aunt has an old house just outside Birmingham. How do you fancy playing a REAL adventure in that old house? She is away on holiday for a couple of weeks and I'm sure I can put something together for you.\" \"Oh yeah! I won't be the subject of another of your practical jokes!\" \"You coward! You're scared!\" \"I'm not!\" \"Do it then! I DARE YOU!\" And so the challenge began. Lizzie needed a week to prepare everything and now that week was over!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Louise Wenlock", "publishers": "The Adventure Workshop", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165650-i-dare-you\n"}
