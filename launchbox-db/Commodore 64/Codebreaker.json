{"altername_name": [], "name": "Codebreaker", "overview": "Simplistic and original early idea from Andromeda Software, of Scarabaeus fame. Set the city free of the wicket magic by recoloring the houses of the citizens! With this aim, generate the required code on your color or digit train by successive crashings. At each crash, the involved colors and digits interchange. Move your train by horizontal joystick action. Fire during motion for increased speed. In senior version you can change rail at hidden crossings by vertical joystick action during motion. Push the rod while your train is at rest and your colors or digits roll to the left. Fire without joystick action for reverse order of colors or digits.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "K.
