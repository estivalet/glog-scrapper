{"altername_name": [], "name": "Interdictor Pilot", "overview": "Thirty years ago space travel was a figment of the imagination of science fiction writers. In 1960 the odds against men landing on the moon within ten years were put at 10,000 to 1 against. One day, maybe sooner than you think, space travel will be commonplace. And one day there will be wars fought in space, perhaps between one country and another, perhaps between civilizations. Interdictor pilot is a faithful recreation of events that have yet to happen. In the year 2131 eleven battlestations of the Jahdra-Gallan Alliance appeared in Federation space, thus violating the terms of the Limhof Concord - this was, of course, the event which started the first Galactic War. It was not until the middle of '33, when the first Interdictor Mk 2 was commissioned, that the Federation could reasonably hope to halt the Incursion of enemy battlestations into federal territory, but at first progress was hindered by a shortage of trained pilots and over 78% of recruits were lost during training. To stem the high casualty rate this simulation has been created. Study carefully the Pilot's Instruction Manual, practice at length in the simulator before attempting live missions. This is no game.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Lawrence Marshall", "publishers": "Supersoft", "genres": "Flight Simulator", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106544-interdictor-pilot\n"}
