Game developed entirely in assembly language with CBM prg Studio. PATAGONIA's first game, and many more to come. Cabygame: - 7 speeds - 4 bonuses - 1 slowdown - 4 seasons: summer, autumn, winter and spring - 1 end at 9999 points. - Clouds & Sun Every 100 points, the distance between obstacles is reduced. It is notable at 5000 points or from 8000 points you will have a horde of obstacles! The item \"Slow\" reduces the speed by one point. Maybe it is more necessary when you are at full speed, and you can avoid it when you are at low speed :)", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "December 10, 2021", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "", "developers": "Patagonia", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUlL85gT_yA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/157521-cabygame\n"}
