{"altername_name": [], "name": "Quizagon", "overview": "The game is played on a board of 26 hexagons, and each player can move about the hexagonal board to an adjacent space each turn. Every move, the player is asked a question from a variety of topics, and if they answer the question correctly, they take the space. For each question, the player must verbally answer, and then must indicate whether their verbal response was correct or incorrect. There are four special quizzard spaces located in each corner, which are flashing hexagons that move about their respective quadrant each turn. If the player lands on this space and answers the question correctly, they gain 1 of 4 markers. If they gain the marker in all 4 corners, they advance to the Grand Quizard stage, and if they answer that final question correctly, they are the winner.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Springboard Software, Inc.", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/124933-quizagon\n"}
