{"altername_name": ["L.E.D. Storm"], "name": "LED Storm", "overview": "By 2011, the only way to travel at top speed is on skyways build high above the ground. These become popular with boy-racers and general speed freaks pretty soon, and that's why you're aiming to hurtle across them in this arcade conversion. The road scrolls vertically, with some moderately sharp bends in a manner similar to Spy Hunter You have a jump device to clear the many jumps, or to land onto and flatten the other maniacs who line the road. You must choose which path to follow at OutRun-style forks in the road. The roads contain bonus tags including bonus points, a battering ram to make contact with other cars more effective, and energy boosts to replenish damage. If you leave the road you must replace your car onto it using a direct-able winch which appears at the appropriate point.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Software Creations", "publishers": "Erbe Software", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.42", "wikipedia": "https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/LED_Storm", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHsdNxwdnT8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109492-led-storm\n"}
