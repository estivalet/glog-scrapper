{"altername_name": [], "name": "Panic Button", "overview": "Like the TRS-80 Release of this game, Panic Button involved one working on a multi-level manufacturing line, trying to keep up orders by assembling various products. The parts drop out of 3 chutes on the top left of the playfield, and you can run all over the place to pick up the 3 different parts of the product, and you have to assemble them in order (for example, a robot must have it's feet on the bottom, torso in the middle, and head on the top). The pieces come out of the first conveyor belt in random order, and you can only carry one piece at a time. If you accidentally assemble a product in the wrong order, it becomes useless, so you have to be careful where you drop the pieces. There is also a Panic Button (hence the game name) in the upper right corner that you can hit that stops the conveyor belts temporarily. For each level, you have to make a specific amount of the product you are creating within a time limit of 2 minutes, and each successive level gets faster and faster (and you also have to build more and more). Also, since the 3 conveyor belts are staggered, and pieces will drop on their own between them, you have to be careful watching them as they get near a drop point, as they could fall on pieces you have already constructed and potentially screw that particular product up. On later levels, the bad products start bouncing around as well, interfering with your manoeuvring.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Paul Kanevsky", "publishers": "First Star Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/123436-panic-button\n"}
