{"altername_name": [], "name": "Psycloid", "overview": "This game was released on Loadstar #115 in 1993 where it was the winner of the Loadstar programming contest. Touted as a clever joystick game with 24 levels. Psycloid is a blend of arcade and puzzle game styles. Your goal is to collect all of the energy pods on a level before the time reaches zero and your craft self-destructs. This isn't as tough as it sounds. It's TOUGHER because there are little drones everywhere that want to get you. The levels are rough, but all solvable IF you can find the right strategy. Your pyramid-shaped craft can move in 4 directions and has a single-shot cannot. You can only fire upwards. The diamond shaped energy pods are collected by touching them with your craft. The round enemy drones are ever present and your craft will be destroyed if it touches one. There are 2 species of drone. The Dormant drone cannot move, but is still deadly to the touch. The Mobile Drone is constantly swarming, only changing directions when it collides with another drone. The countdown timer will be bumped up by one second when a drone is shot, so it's good idea to shoot as many as possible. There can be over 100 Mobile Drones per level. The hourglass shaped homing mine is intelligent and can travel through walls but not drones. It is indestructible and will attack your craft constantly. There can be up to 4 homing mines per level.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Marc Walters", "publishers": "Softdisk Publishing", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WILBnBsvyno", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/124452-psycloid\n"}
