{"altername_name": [], "name": "Al Barakah", "overview": "Al Barakah is a 2003 SEUCK game developed by Mariano Palao for the 2003 SEUCK Game Compo. It is a vertically scrolling shooter where many of the ships will take more than a single shot to destroy. Boss fights require you to take out the big ship in sections. As you progress through levels you will find the enemies shoot far more erratically so it is harder to avoid their shots.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2003", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mariano Palao", "publishers": "The New Dimension (TND)", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtnPDrB7OhY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/125490-al-barakah\n"}
