{"altername_name": ["Catch"], "name": "Body Slam", "overview": "Body Slam is a tag team professional wrestling game where one can choose from four tag teams to compete. These tag teams are the Mad Soldiers, the Orient Express, the Great Maskmen and the Crush Brothers and they all have something to prove. Each wrestler has his own special moves ranging anywhere from knee butts and body slams to flying head butts and pile drivers. The Mad Soldiers and the Great Maskmen can also use metal chairs to hit their opponents outside the ring while the Orient Express and the Crush Brothers have the capability of climbing onto the turnbuckle and releasing damaging blows to their opponents. Each wrestler can also bounce off the ropes to release a running attack. When a wrestler is low on health, he can tag his teammate in to carry on in the match. The game was released as Catch in Italy by various publishers.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jonathan French", "publishers": "Edizioni Societ\u00e0 SIPE", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/DbnVzBYmh0E", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/89562-body-slam\n"}
