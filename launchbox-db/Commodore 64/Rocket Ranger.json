{"altername_name": [], "name": "Rocket Ranger", "overview": "Rocket Ranger is a 1988 action adventure computer game developed and published by Cinemaware. Like many Cinemaware games, Rocket Ranger draws its inspiration from Hollywood, and likely The Rocketeer comics. This title pays homage to the many 1950s sci-fi serials, using the look and feel of the serials, including action-packed cut-scenes and an art treatment loyal to the futuristic visions of that era. It also features the clich\u00e9 elements of that era, including a dashing, courageous hero and a beautiful, voluptuous damsel in distress in need of rescue.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Cinemaware", "publishers": "Beau-Jolly", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsNYEd3Yjys", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/31881-rocket-ranger\n"}
