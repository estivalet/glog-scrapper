{"altername_name": [], "name": "Kangarudy II: The Adventure Continues", "overview": "Kangarudy II: The Adventure Continues... is very similar to its predecessor. The player has freed some kangaroos from being slain and now has to bring them back to their home. From a world map, the route to Australia is chosen. Then the game switches to a side-scrolling level, where majority of the playing time takes place. Here the player drives from left to right (either by boat or truck), avoids obstacles and collects power-ups like extra lives or parachutes. However, the main problem are the kangaroos which can't stand still. So they regularly jump out of the vehicle and the player has drive it to the correct place of the screen so the kangaroos land back safely - otherwise a life is lost. Some levels also have some gimmicks, e.g. fog or darkness, depending on the chosen route.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hans Ippisch", "publishers": "Haip Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75927-kangarudy-ii-the-adventure-continues\n"}
