{"altername_name": ["Monster Voyage", "Aegean Voyage"], "name": "Aegean Voyage", "overview": "Your mission is to find as many treasures as possible by clever maneuvers (sometimes by storm) to various bays / islands. Even the smallest collision with a rocky pixel costs a life. Once there, you get a clue and have to decide if you want to search the island or not. If you make the right decision, you will find a treasure. Otherwise, your ship will be sunk by a monster or god of antiquity. The game ends when all treasures are found or all ships are sunk.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Joyce Hakansson Associates", "publishers": "Maxion Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.09", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoUxXxSiraQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86703-aegean-voyage\n"}
