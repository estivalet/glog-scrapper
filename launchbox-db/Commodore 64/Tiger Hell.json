{"altername_name": ["XTime"], "name": "Tiger Hell", "overview": "A helicopter gunship shooter created in SEUCK by Joachim Ljunggren aka The Sarge of Triad and released in Digital Marketing PD #003, and in Stonysoft #1735, later it was released in Italy under the original name and as XTime in Go Games n.32 (maggio 1988). On a special mission on a powerful helicopter you have to fly over enemy territory and return to your base. Using the joystick with dexterity and pressing the button with fervor, you can defeat all the enemies and finally save yourself. The territory you patrol is varied and full of pitfalls. In the jungle the tanks advance with cannons ready to shoot mercilessly. On the sea, the situation is even more difficult. One of the most dangerous missions is the flyover of the airport, as various squadrons of jets arrive suddenly, ready to destroy you with powerful machine gun bursts. A great strategy is to take out the enemies before they orient themselves and begin returning fire.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Joachim Ljunggren", "publishers": "Editions Fermont", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/a2XJbKtSrrs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/132632-tiger-hell\n"}
