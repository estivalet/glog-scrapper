{"altername_name": [], "name": "Stellar Dodger", "overview": "As an interstellar shuttle pilot you provide the vital link between your starcruiser mothership and its supply dumps. Only the finest pilots are permitted to command a shuttle because of the high level of skill needed to land and dock safely. Even more demanding is the ability to negotiate the trecherous asteroid belts of the supply planets. You can blast them away, but as their density falls it causes a gravitational vortex which sucks more asteroids into your sector. Your commander is very demanding - as soon as you complete a successful mission, another, more difficult one is set.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "D.K.
