{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Castle of Kraizar", "overview": "A single player roll playing game created by John Patrick Green and published in 1993. It appears to be heavily influenced by Sword of Fargol. Long ago, a child was born in the city of Kraizar, a child with bony limbs and discolored skin. Being superstitious, the parents left the imperfect child in the woods to die. However, an old wizard, Ibonek Nawibo, found the child. He named the child Jrakhos, and raised him as an apprentice. The boy had great talent in sorcery. When he had learned as much as Ibonek could teach him, he began tampering with unknown forces. Consumed by the desire for power, he summoned all evil from the depths of hell and set it upon Kraizar. He gained control of the castle and broke it's key into numerous pieces that are now scattered throughout the town. Only the one known as the Legender can destroy Jrakhos and end his reign of evil. Thus begins our story...", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "John Patrick Green", "publishers": "Mnemonic Productions", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVsxd4de29s", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/89538-the-castle-of-kraizar\n"}
