{"altername_name": [], "name": "Corman", "overview": "In this Jumpman inspired game, you play Corman who is a cat-burglar attempting to pull of the biggest diamond heist in history, with the aid of his super-power, jumping long distances. In this single screen platform game, you control Corman as you try to collect all the diamonds on each of the ten screens. Connecting the platforms are ladders, and lifts that move in one direction, and some of the platforms make Corman move. Blocks and creatures fly across the screen and if Corman touches one or falls off the bottom of the screen then he loses one of his nine lives.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Micro Application", "publishers": "Micro Application", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27avRwZscOQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/94008-corman\n"}
