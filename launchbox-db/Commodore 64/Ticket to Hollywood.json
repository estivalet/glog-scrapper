{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ticket to Hollywood", "overview": "Ticket to Hollywood is an educational trivia game based upon Hollywood films, directors, and actors from the 1910s - 1980s. The player plays from a top-down perspective, and can visit a variety of Hollywood locations on 6 separate maps. The player can visit a number of famous Hollywood locations, and can also time travel between 8 different decades to visit locations that existed during that time period. The game is controlled by moving a cursor via mouse, keyboard, or joystick. The player's goal is to earn stars, by following clues to locations and time periods to find a mysterious director. When the player finds the director, they can ask the director a question, and if he can answer it, the player receives an additional star. The player earns an additional 3 stars if they can answer the director's questions. As the player travels, they use energy, which is displayed on the bottom of the screen. If the player loses all their energy, it is game over. The player can regain energy by visiting any location the director is not located, and being quizzed by the Movie Madame. For every answer correct, the player regains some energy to help with their adventure. The ultimate goal is to maximize stars, so that the player themselves can appear on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Blue Lion Software", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/132627-ticket-to-hollywood\n"}
