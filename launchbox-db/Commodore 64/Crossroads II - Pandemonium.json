{"altername_name": [], "name": "Crossroads II: Pandemonium", "overview": "This was the second and final game in Compute!'s Crossroads series. A fast paced maze shooter with various enemies with various abilities getting in your way. Considered by many as one of the better type-in games of the era for the C64. Published in the December 1988 issue of Compute!'s Gazette, which was exactly one year after the first game was published. As for the game itself, it's almost like a cross between Wizard of Wor and Berzerk, with some elements of Robotron as well.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Steve Harter", "publishers": "COMPUTE!
