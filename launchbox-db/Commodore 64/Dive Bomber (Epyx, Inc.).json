Armed with torpedoes and a machine gun, can you destroy the Bismarck with a well-aimed torpedo and turn the tide of WW2 in the Allies' favour? Find out is this flight simulation and strategy game. How you complete the task is largely up to you. You will need to deal with the plane's instruments, to take off, and plan which areas of the sky you patrol in the search for the Bismarck.

Statistics on how much of each enemy's fleet you destroy are kept.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Acme Animation", "publishers": "Epyx", "genres": "Flight Simulator", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.78", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1ZUyTqVs-A", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/96589-dive-bomber-epyx-inc\n"}
