{"altername_name": [], "name": "Color Match", "overview": "A game created by Daniel Miller and published in 1987 in Loadstar #037. At first Daniel Miller's Color Match puzzle seems rather simple. All you have to do is piece together 16 blocks into a rectangular grid. There's a catch, however. The pieces, colored with various combinations of red and yellow, must be arranged so that where the blocks meet, the colors match. Still sound simple. It's much easier said than done.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "July 1, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Daniel Miller", "publishers": "Softdisk Publishing, Inc.", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/91086-color-match\n"}
