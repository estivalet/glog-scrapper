Upper Gumtree is a typical sleepy English village. Nothing happens there. It's boring. Then Professor Blowitovitz moves in and some bizarre events occur. Perhaps there is a connection? Then, one quiet Sunday morning, the news is interrupted by an announcement to the world's governments, 'Surrender or die, horribly of course'. It's the professor, his plans are complete and it's the player's task to stop him. This adventure game has some novel features: Time passes while the player considering their next move so there is a HOLD command to pause the game. Items can be carried by the player's friends Wally and Emma. The graphics can be disabled to improve performance.
