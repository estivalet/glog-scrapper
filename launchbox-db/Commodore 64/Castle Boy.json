{"altername_name": [], "name": "Castle Boy", "overview": "Castle Boy is a platform game created by Norbert Mirani and was released in 1986 as part of the GEMS game pack. It was your Master's research which caused the problem. His little experiment in demon summoning was a much greater success than he bargained for. So much so that his castle has been overrun by them and he himself has gone missing. Luckily, earlier in his research he had developed a potion which could be used to banish the demons back to their own dimension. There were only two problems, it tasted awful and it didn't remain active for very long. To overcome the first it was injected into various items of food. However there was as yet, no solution the second issue. Armed with only luck, skill and your knowledge of the potion, it's up to you to clear the demons from the castle, beginning at the bottom and ending at the small tower on the roof.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Norbert Merani", "publishers": "Digital Dynamite Productions", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90345-castle-boy\n"}
