{"altername_name": [], "name": "Connection: Gravity", "overview": "A puzzle\\strategy game created by Attila Tajti and published in Magic Disk 64 1993/02. In this game you have to try to join the two blue stones. You should pay special attention to gravity, which will often outsmart you. In addition, there are green stones and useful \"bubbles\" to help with this difficult task. To move a stone you just have to select it with the cursor, hold down the fire button and press it in the desired direction. The green and blue stones can only be influenced horizontally, while the \"bubbles\" can also be influenced vertically. Sometimes you have to turn the stones. You can do this by pressing the fire button and the joystick down. There is also an included level designer.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Attila Tajti", "publishers": "CP Verlag", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZpq1ZePlvw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/91173-connection-gravity\n"}
