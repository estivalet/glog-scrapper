{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bowling (Robtek)", "overview": "And here you are, ready for a splendid day of bowling. Our perky and cheerful player is ready to give the best of himself and become the king of the lanes! Once the game is started 10 boxes will appear on your video where you will be able to check your scores, you will also see two words Roll (Turno) and Ball (Palla) as you will be entitled to 10 turns of two balls each. So now concentrate and be ready for the first pitch. Hit the pins at just the right point and slaughter the poor skittles at the end of the track. On the line on the top left it will show the number of biritli that you managed to knock down; at the top right the result of the second shot in which you will try to pick up the spare. However, do not be alarmed if your little man will appear depressed by making a mistake and throw strange curses, in the blink of an eye he will be ready for the challenge again! Pull a strike and your man will be excited and happy and scoring won't happen immediately, but after your next roll if another strike is not thrown. If you want competition, play with your friends in turn or go shot by shot for an interesting challenge.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Robtek", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/89944-bowling-robtek\n"}
