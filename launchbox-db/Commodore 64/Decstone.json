{"altername_name": ["Frana"], "name": "Decstone", "overview": "A very challenging logic\\puzzle game created by Ralph Kaspers and published in Starlight Magazine #5 and published in Italy in New Special PlayGames n.47 (aprile 1992) and in Hit Parade C64 n.68 (Giugno 1992). IN this game you have to walk along a fixed path until you reach the exit, and do it within a limited time. Unfortunately for you, the path will collapse under your feet and it will be impossible to retrace your steps. The path is made up of many rectangles marked with a number, a letter or a color. The number represents the times you have to pass over that stretch of the path to make it collapse. The rectangle marked with an E indicates the exit while rectangles marked with a T are from the transporters. The rectangles marked with and I will never collapse while the colored ones collapse all together as soon as you walk on a section of that color. Be very careful not to collapse pieces of the path necessary to reach the exit because in this case the only solution is \"suicide\".", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ralph Kaspers", "publishers": "Edizioni Societ\u00e0 SIPE", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAx7Ecji-dE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/96180-decstone\n"}
