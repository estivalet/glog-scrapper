{"altername_name": ["Centrale Nucleare"], "name": "Battle Bound Project", "overview": "Insanely hard tank game released in 1985 by Compumania and made by Michael A. Knox (who also did Sinbad and the Throne of the Falcon). In this game you must penetrate with your tank into the heavily fortified enemy city. Now the mission is to reach and destroy the Nuclear Power plant that supplies the city. The endeavor is not the simplest due to the numerous anti-tank turrets scattered along the route, and that of the fast armored chariots guided by the computer that regulates the defensive system of the planet.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Michael A.
