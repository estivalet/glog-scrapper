So enjoy a glimpse of a Dinamic game that never was.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Narciso Quintana", "publishers": "Dinamic Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/8lqa8efL-Nw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/163285-operation-neptune-dinamic-software\n"}
