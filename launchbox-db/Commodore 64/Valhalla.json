{"altername_name": [], "name": "Valhalla", "overview": "Living in the Norse God's home of Valhalla, you are on the bottom of the social scale. To move up this scale you have decided to attempt six quests, which involves searching and finding six magical objects: Ofnir, Drapnir, Skornir, Skalir, Felstrong and Grimnir. You must explore the lands to find or buy objects needed like swords and helmets (you can only have one of each), interact with the other inhabitants (by talking or helping them) to join you on your quest or give you items they own, and keep eating and drinking to keep your strength up. Once you find a magical object you must deposit it as you can only carry so many items, some objects can't be carried together, and if you die you go to Hell and any objects you have are lost and appear in the game in a new location.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Legend", "publishers": "Eurosoft International", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valhalla_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTqzaTIejSQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/110102-valhalla\n"}
