{"altername_name": [], "name": "Marble Boy", "overview": "You are Marble Boy and you need to collect 45 pennants/banners in a given order and time. Watch out for holes, work on your maneuvering skills and learn to take shortcuts to save valuable seconds. Are you swift enough to reach the finishing line? General moving also collects points. When competing with your friends then finding the perfect path and flow will make all the difference in the end score. Trivia: This game is an homage to two of my favourite arcade games: Marble Madness where you control a marble and play on a checkered background and Buggy Boy, where you pick up flags to make points. Hence the name \"Marble Boy\". Recognition effect is intended but otherwise the game, graphic and sound is all made from scratch and offers its own unique gameplay experience. Have a great marble run!
