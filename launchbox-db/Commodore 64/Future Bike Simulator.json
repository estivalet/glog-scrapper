{"altername_name": [], "name": "Future Bike Simulator", "overview": "Future Bike Simulator is a futuristic action game set in 1999. The government forbid motorcycles and so the billionaire Finnius M Houlder built a hovercraft replacement. And while he was at it, he also added some guns. So now his goal is to drive and kill people who move slower than him (which is everyone). Killed enemies leave behind money which can be reinvested into vehicle upgrades between levels. A life is lost when the energy bar is completely drained, so it is advised to dodge obstacles and vehicles. Movement is restricted to left and right; the speed can't be regulated.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "PAL Developments", "publishers": "Hi-Tec Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/101891-future-bike-simulator\n"}
