{"altername_name": [], "name": "Play a Match", "overview": "Play tennis against a friend or the computer, published in Magic Disk 64 1993/09. Wimbledon 1993. Boris Becker has once again not achieved his goal, because Pete Sampras won the final at Wimbledon. You can now pick up the racket yourself, \"Play A Match\" offers all the advantages of the popular tennis sport. \"Play A Match\" can of course also be played in pairs. If this is the case, the joystick in port # 2 controls the player at the bottom of the screen, the joystick in port # 1, of course, controls the top tennis crack. Several settings can be made in the selection menu, such as: Joystick down - change the color of the place Joystick up - change the level Joystick right - play against computer Joystick left - play against humanoids The match is started with fire. The normal tennis rules are played, but the second serve has been removed as it only hinders the flow of the game. When you hit you push fire and then in the desired direction. This should be done very quickly to avoid unnecessary points of error. If you are too slow, you simply play straight ahead. When the game is in full swing, a few other rules count. If the felt ball is exactly next to the player's sprite and you then press fire, the ball is hit straight ahead. The earlier or later you thrash the ball, the more obliquely it will be played. It takes a little practice.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "CP Verlag", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/124152-play-a-match\n"}
