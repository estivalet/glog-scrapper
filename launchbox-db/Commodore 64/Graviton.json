In his latest game, GRAVITON you have to use your powers of dexterity to steer a ball through a maze. Careful reactions and precise control are necessary to successfully navigate the mazes. ** THE GAME ** Guide the ball along the path through the maze by tilting the board and letting gravity do the work. Try not to fall into the holes! The further you go, the more points you get. An indicator on the right shows which way the board is currently tilted. Focus on precise and gentle joystick motion! It may take some time getting used to. ** FEATURES ** \u00b7 20 challenging maps to navigate through \u00b7 Sleek clean visuals \u00b7 Responsive controls \u00b7 Silky smooth scrolling \u00b7 Atmospheric soundtracks \u00b7 TheC64 Mini/Maxi compatible ** CREDITS ** Programmed by Karl H\u00f6rnell Graphics and Game Design by Karl H\u00f6rnell Music by Hans Axelsson-Svala & Alexander Danielsson Packaging Artwork by Karl H\u00f6rnell Additional Packaging Design by Jason \u2018Kenz\u2019 Mackenzie Tape Mastering by Richard Bayliss & Martin Piper \u00a9 2021 Eweguo aka Karl H\u00f6rnell", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "September 1, 2021", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Eweguo", "publishers": "Psytronik Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Moq1_Aqu2Nc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/155370-graviton\n"}
