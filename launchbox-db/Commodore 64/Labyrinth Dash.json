{"altername_name": [], "name": "Labyrinth Dash", "overview": "The Boulder Dash Construction Kit was first released in 1986 for Commodore 64, and later for other platforms. It includes a comprehensive toolset featuring all items and themes required to build the levels in the full Boulder Dash game. Some versions also allowed users to sequence levels together and save them to a cassette tape or diskette creating an early form of fan-made level pack. From there it became fairly easy for users to create standalone, fully customized and individualized variant games in the Boulder-Dash genre and this is one of those and a well respected one. Peter Liepa put this one out and he is still active in Boulder Dash style game creation, publishing The Lost Caves series that publishes a game in that series about once a year. The Lost Caves 13 came out in 2019.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Marek Roth", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109295-labyrinth-dash\n"}
