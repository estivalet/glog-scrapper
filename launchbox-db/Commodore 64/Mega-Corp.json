Being both of them expansionist governments, frictions in their borders are almost constant. Within the Empire, the biggest power after the emperor himself, are the Mega Corporations, financial partnerships that control every aspect of people's lives. With power of life and death, these Mega-Corp, as they are familiarly known, extend their tentacles by the Cosmos in search of riches to extract or eventually snatch.
