{"altername_name": [], "name": "International Ice Hockey", "overview": "International Ice Hockey is a basic ice hockey game in which the player participates in a league. The goal obviously is to reach the top of the league which is achieved by winning matches against other teams. If the own team has possession of the puck, the player can start a shot by holding the fire button - the longer kept, the more power goes into the shot. When in defense, the player can choose between two control methods: either manual cycling through the athletes or the game automatically switches to the one nearest to the puck. Other options include the strategy (athlete positioning), three difficulty levels, the time per period (two, five or twenty minutes) and if the highlights of the game should be replayed after each third. Offside and icing are ignored.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Zeppelin Games", "publishers": "EDOS", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWlJDWZheck", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106555-international-ice-hockey\n"}
