{"altername_name": [], "name": "Lode Runner: Conrad's Levels", "overview": "150 very challenging Lode Runner levels published in Loadstar #190. According to Loadstar #190 these levels were created by Fred, Barbra and Nicole Conrad, the team, from Burnaby, British Columbia that has created more levels than any other group, over 750 levels at the time up this game's publication. Some controls for the game are: CTRL-R to quit the level, CRL-U to go up a level, CTRL-F to add extra lives and CTRL-Z to disable the iris effect. CTRL-A to abort the current life if you get stuck and CRTL-E to go to the Edit screen. The first level requires you to perform an advanced trick to solve. You have to ride on top of a bad guy as he falls, jumping off at just the right point to pick up a gold bar that is otherwise impossible to get. It continues to be this challenging throughout. Good luck!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2000", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Conrad", "publishers": "J & F Publishing, Inc.", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/130143-lode-runner-conrads-levels\n"}
