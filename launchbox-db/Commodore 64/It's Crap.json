{"altername_name": [], "name": "It's Crap", "overview": "Despite the game's ironic name, this is actually a pretty well made dice based gambling game, especially considering it's coded entirely in BASIC. You start off with 1000 British pounds. There is no minimum or maximum bet amount (as long as you don't bet more than you currently have) you can bet as little as 1 pound. The gameplay is simple, just type in your bet amount, hit the return key, and keep hitting return until you win or lose.
