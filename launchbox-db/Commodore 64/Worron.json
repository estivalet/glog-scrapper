{"altername_name": [], "name": "Worron", "overview": "A Sabre Wulf style game with a hint of platform action thrown in for good measure. Bas-refief graphics were used to good effect to give the perception of depth going into the screen. For instance, you could only run over platforms when they were at the correct level. The game also included some jazzy parallax scrolling and all kinds of nice little features. Unfortunately, it would never be released by Firebird in the UK and was lost to time. Then in 2015 Games That Weren't helped recover a copy of it, but found the version they had wasn't quite finished in places. So Richard Paynter, the original author came back to decompile and fix it all, as well as including an intro, music, better sound effects and as of May 23, 2021 released it back to the scene with a final version on June 6th of the same year.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Richard Paynter", "publishers": "Firebird Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MisYxDy8aO4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/152228-worron\n"}
