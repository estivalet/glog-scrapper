You have been sent down mines, to explore 50 screens, on each of which you must collect a key and reach the exit. You also have to pick up a sacred artifact on every 5th level. Your character is very bouncy, requiring small movements in order to keep control. You can shoot at the surrounding enemies and collect weapons, although the initial one only shoots horizontally.
