{"altername_name": [], "name": "Vector Runner", "overview": "Vector Runner - 2018, Protovision - Simple but fun vector graphics skill game. The mission of the game is to jump over the obstacles on the right-scrolling stage at any given moment - a gameplay comparable to C64Anabalt. Meanwhile, in order to increase our scores, we can collect a number of small rotating squares, which reminds me of Dare Devil Dennis. We can also double our jumps by pressing the fire button at the right moment while jumping. We can also reach checkpoints during our trip, which means that after the missed jumps we do not always have to start the game from the beginning of the stage.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2018", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Eric Hilaire", "publishers": "Protovision", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nm1SnsI7OQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/160355-vector-runner\n"}
