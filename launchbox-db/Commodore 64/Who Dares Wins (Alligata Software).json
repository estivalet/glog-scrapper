{"altername_name": [], "name": "Who Dares Wins (Alligata Software)", "overview": "Eight invaded areas must be brought back under your control in this Commando-style shoot 'em up, which progresses vertically using a flick-screen system. You are armed with a rifle (activated by a short tap of the fire button) and five grenades (used via a longer press), and must not only kill off the enemy forces, but also rescue your comrades who are being lead away. Extra supplies are found as you progress through the game, as are extra lives in addition to your starting 3. Enemies attack from all areas of the screen, making good use of the decoy opportunities of the terrain, and you must do the same to have a chance. The levels include rivers with narrow bridges and potholes. After level 8 you get a screen congratulating you then it says your backup team did not hold so you have to return to level 1 again.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Steve Evans", "publishers": "Alligata Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.22", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mM00hd4_6s", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/7458-who-dares-wins-alligata-software\n"}
