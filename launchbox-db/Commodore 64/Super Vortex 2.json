Contributor, Pinov Vox brings to The New Dimension a full vertical scrolling space shoot 'em up called Super Vortex 2. An alien empire has attacked your base. In the verge to have your revenge, you set off in to deep space and do battle against many alien battle cruisers and alien forces. An new intergalactic war has taken place. It is now time for you to defend your own territory. This game can be played with 1 or 2 players, or with both players linked with a shared score and lives. It is time for you to cause a lot of devastation and destruction to the alien bases.
