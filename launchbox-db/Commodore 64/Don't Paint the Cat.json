{"altername_name": [], "name": "Don't Paint the Cat", "overview": "A tone recognition game from the book \"Brainteasers for the Commodore 64\". Seems a strange title for a program. I mean, who would want to emulsion paint the family mogg anyway? Well you see, the family has decided that you have to paint the garden fence. You lost the draw. Across the fence from you and your fantastic paint brush, is your neighbor's transistor. As a mental challenge you have decided to paint the fence according to the high/low pitch of your neighbor's music. Look out for the cat, it's parked at the end of the fence. s the game begins you will hear just two notes to compare, but every time you get the answer correct, the next tune will have an extra note. You will be told which two notes to compare, and you must key in H or L for high or low. If you get it wrong you must wait for the fence, and maybe the poor old pussy, to be painted. If you take too long to answer, the cat will end up getting covered in paint anyway. Press the return key when you want a new tune.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Genevi\u00e8ve Ludinski", "publishers": "Phoenix Publishing Associates", "genres": "Music", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/97010-dont-paint-the-cat\n"}
