{"altername_name": [], "name": "Spike C64 Dislike", "overview": "The goal is to get a bouncing ball over and under an endless series of spikes. The ball bounces up and down automatically, while pressing the screen makes it move forward. To play Spike Dislike is to carefully time presses with the bounces to maneuver around the unlikeable spikes. It\u2019s fairly basic stuff, and if the goal was simply to get as far as possible, there wouldn\u2019t be much to it. You could take your time with each spike, waiting until the perfect moment to clear it. But Spike Dislike is all about the high score. You receive one point for each spike you pass and, crucially, increase your multiplier by one for each spike you pass in quick succession. After each spike a bar begins to rapidly shrink at the top of the screen; pass the next spike before it depletes and you keep your combo going and your multiplier rising.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2012", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "David Eriksson", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/76091-spike-c64-dislike\n"}
