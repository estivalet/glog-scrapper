{"altername_name": [], "name": "Fun School 4: For 5 to 7 Year Olds", "overview": "Freddy the Frog presents six games designed to help school-starting children build on their numeracy and literacy skills. The rules for each game are explained in the form of short stories. Controls primarily use the cursor keys and enter. Freddie is building a house, but can only add a log to his work if you solve a maths question. In the library, a list of book titles must be sorted into alphabetical order. Successfully ordering letter and number sequences on the basketball court results in shots going in. Knowing which word is the opposite of the displayed one will help Freddy's diving. In the shop you have to identify which coins pay for which items, and then total up a shopping load and work out which coins pay for it. There is also a simple typing test included.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Chris Walsh", "publishers": "Europress Software", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/117621-fun-school-4-for-5-to-7-year-olds\n"}
