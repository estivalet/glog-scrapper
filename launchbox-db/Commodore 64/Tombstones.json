But he is tired of killing, and wants to retire from his gunslinger career to settle down with his true love, MISS. JIGGLYTITS. However, having this stellar reputation tempt outlaws from the whole wide west to seek him down for duels! Will it be possible for EL GRINGO to survive his retirement day and get to his true love? AIM OF THE GAME: To get to his true love, EL GRINGO has to gun down 6 outlaws on 3 different stages: The Desert, The City and The Graveyard.
