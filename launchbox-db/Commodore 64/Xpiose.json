{"altername_name": [], "name": "Xpiose", "overview": "A head to head breakout duel game published in Magic Disk 64 1993/04. Ping-pong has fascinated sports fans of all nationalities for thousands of years. If you want to transfer this phenomenon to the computer world, the very clear answer is: \"Breakout!\" \"Xpiose\", however, combines both games perfectly. On the one hand, an attempt must be made to throw the ball around the ears of the opposing player. On the other hand, the stone barricade in the rear of the opponent must also be dissolved. Only when the hidden picture can be enjoyed in all its glory will the winner be determined. It can be played against the computer as well as against humanoid players. The number of laps and any possible laps are displayed in the start menu. The miracle bubble can contain bonus points and extra lives as well as brief paralysis and complete death. So you should be prepared for anything", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Henrik Holmdahl", "publishers": "CP Verlag", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LfhGy0egY8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/132248-xpiose\n"}
