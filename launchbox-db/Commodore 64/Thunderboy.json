{"altername_name": [], "name": "Thunderboy", "overview": "Thunderboy is a single player science fiction platformer video game for Commodore 64, created by Twice Effects and published by CP Verlag in Magic Disk 64 1993/01. The little \"Thunderboy\" really has a thankless job. As a furious exterminator, he has to put an end to the annoying rodents and insects. In each level a certain number of vermin must be brought down in order to be able to consider the corresponding area as \"clean\". The laser cannon only moves very slowly at the top of the screen and it takes some practice to use this weapon on the repulsive insect hunt. In particularly hopeless situations, you should finally use a powerful Smartbomb. This wonderful cleaning agent numbs all insects at once, so that you can breathe a sigh of relief for a few seconds. But not for too long either, because after all it is important to collect the frozen beings at lightning speed, otherwise they will wake up from their involuntary nightmare. One touch is enough and the nuisance is already in the spacious Thunder backpack.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "January 4, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Twice Effects", "publishers": "CP Verlag", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/132595-thunderboy\n"}
