{"altername_name": [], "name": "Save New York", "overview": "Save New York is a shoot 'em up game where the player has to protect New York City from invading aliens. The game takes place on a single static screen with various skyscraper buildings and a subway tunnel running underneath them. At either edge of the screen is an airplane launching pad. The game can be played by one or two players. Player one has a white airplane and player two has a blue one. In a two-player game, both airplanes are on screen at the same time. During play, aliens resembling large spiders begin to descend from the sky, flying towards the buildings. If left alone, they will eat parts of the buildings, eventually causing them to collapse. The player has to shoot the aliens to stop them from eating the buildings. When all aliens on a level have been killed, the game progresses to the next level. The player earns bonus points for each apartment still left intact.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Joe Jetson", "publishers": "Creative Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Save_New_York", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_LtZJjIDL0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/89645-save-new-york\n"}
