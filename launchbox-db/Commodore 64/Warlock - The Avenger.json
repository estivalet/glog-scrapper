{"altername_name": [], "name": "Warlock: The Avenger", "overview": "A follow-up to the mid-80s Gauntlet clone Druid, which saw the series move up onto 16-bit systems. The gameplay involves guiding your character through a succession of 8 mazes. The standard bad guys are there, as are items to pick up including health and extra weapons. The game gives you one life, which represents the gradually declining amount of energy. You should get further on each go, with the difficulty curve being quite precise. As a bonus, an exclusive conversion of Druid is included.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "John P.
