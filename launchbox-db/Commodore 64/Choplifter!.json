Your mission: Go behind enemy lines and rescue up to 16 hostages per level. Be careful, though, because tanks and enemy aircraft will try to stop you - and they won't stop shooting while you are rescuing those hostages! Originally released for Apple II home computers, Choplifter! was later ported to the arcades and a number of video game consoles. Many imitators and homages would follow.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "July 1, 1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dane Bigham", "publishers": "Br\u00f8derbund Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.32", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choplifter", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6tU7se18Sk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6494-choplifter\n"}
