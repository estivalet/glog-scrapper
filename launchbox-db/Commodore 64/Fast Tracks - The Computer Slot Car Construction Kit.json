{"altername_name": ["Overpass"], "name": "Fast Tracks: The Computer Slot Car Construction Kit", "overview": "Fast Tracks: The Computer Slot Car Construction Kit is viewed from a forced overhead perspective, and loosely recreates slot car racing, also sharing its feel and some features with the much later Super Skidmarks. The secret is to knock the three rival cars off the circuit completely - this gives the player a two-second time bonus and sends that car back to the start of the lap. Seven circuits are built in and more can be created using the supplied editor. They feature oil patches (causing the car to spin if steered through), bridges and underpasses, chicane and hairpin bends, and overlapping sections (collisions on these will usually knock both cars off).", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mark Turmell", "publishers": "Activision", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Tracks:_Th...", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQoPqzm7mCs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/100519-fast-tracks-the-computer-slot-car-construction-kit\n"}
