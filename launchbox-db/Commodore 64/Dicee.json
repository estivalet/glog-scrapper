{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dicee", "overview": "Dicee was created by Louis K. Avanzi and published in UpTime Vol.2 #04 in 1988. Dicee is a 1-4 player dice poker game. The object of the game is to maximize the point value of your dice with one point for Aces, 2 for Deuces, 3 for Threes and so forth. A 100 point bonus will be added to your score if the above total is 63 or more. Two pair are scored at face value, 3 of a kind gets a 10 point bonus over face value, straights a 20 point bonus, flush with a 30 point bonus over face, Full House a 50 point bump over face, Four of a kind with a 100 point bonus, Straight Flush a 250 point bonus over face and the \"freebee\" section scored over face. The above total will be added to the previous totals and the highest scoring player wins the game. Each of the 14 possible hands can be used only once. If you cannot make a hand you must take a zero on any unused hand or use it as your freebee. Use the 1-5 key to discard dice for 2nd and 3rd rolls. Return when you don't need additional rolls and use to select a hand when scoring. Cursor up or down to score.
