{"altername_name": [], "name": "Caterpillar", "overview": "From the book \"The Commodore 64 Program Book\". Horror of horrors \u2014 if you hate creepy crawlies and spiders this is not the game for you. You are being chased around the screen by a fast advancing caterpillar and \"six\" giant red spiders. Scattered around the screen are a number of purple toadstools and yellow mushrooms. If you eat one of the mushrooms your movement will speed up for a short time but \u2014 if the caterpillar eats one of the toadstools its speed will increase for a short time. You can gain 10 points for each segment of the caterpillar you shoot, and, because the spiders are really bad news, 100 points for each one destroyed. If you are sharp enough to hit the caterpillar between the eyes on its orange head, be warned \u2014 it will regenerate from a random position on the screen. The game will end if the caterpillar or the spiders get you or if you collide with the segments of the caterpillar. To move left and right use keys O & P To move up and down use keys Q & A To fire, press keys W & S for up and down and L & : for left and right.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Vince Apps", "publishers": "Phoenix Publishing Associates", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90381-caterpillar\n"}
