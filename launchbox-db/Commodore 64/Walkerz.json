{"altername_name": [], "name": "Walkerz", "overview": "Similar to Lemmings, your goal is to allow the walkers to safely amble along the path from doorway to doorway. You control the bridges that let them pass gaps in the path safely. But there are multiple walkers going at different speeds and directions on multiple paths and you only have one bridge to be shared amongst them. Please keep the walkers from falling to a grisly doom.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Michal Bac\u00edk", "publishers": "Electric Boys Entertainment Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDbJhPMAZd0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/114372-walkerz\n"}
