{"altername_name": [], "name": "Earthraid", "overview": "In this strategy war game, the goal is to stop the invasion of the extraterrestrial mollusks. The invaders known as the Mollusks reproduce very quickly and do not like water, so there are many ways to stop them. You can dig a hole, which will instantly be filled with water. Laying a mine can blow up four other spaces, filling them with water and if the mollusks move on to these, kaput! You can also spray poison, which will poison the Mollusks reducing their health, but it will also poison the land and lower your score. To prevent human losses you can evacuate houses using a helicopter. You can also use a rocket to deal instant damage to a certain radius. You will get a new rocket periodically. The game ends once all Mollusks have been destroyed.
