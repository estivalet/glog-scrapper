{"altername_name": ["Odino"], "name": "Nova Force", "overview": "A Shoot'em Up - SEUCK based vertical space battle game. It seems that all is now lost on the distant planet Deimos, the Rutilians have managed to reach the interplanetary base where the access and defense codes are kept. Nothing can be done to arrest them. But a scientist from the super-confederacy has created a new Nova-Proton weapon, a new experimental ship that autonomously governed, therefore free from computer ties, could be able to infiltrate the enemy defense network, fight their cruisers and fighters, destroy their missile bases and turn the tables. But for such a high tech ship, a special and highly skilled pilot is also required. You as a member of Odin, have been chosen to lead this Nova Force on this difficult mission, to restore peace and tranquility to Deimos, but also to save all humanity from a huge disaster. Published in Italy as Odino in Special Program n.46 (settembre 1988) and later in Hit Parade C64 n.30 (Gennaio 1989).", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Chris Yates", "publishers": "Edizioni Societ\u00e0 SIPE", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/nBuke0Wt1QE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/123031-nova-force\n"}
