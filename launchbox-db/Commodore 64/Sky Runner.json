{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sky Runner", "overview": "SKY is the drug used by the 24th century planetary dictatorship to keep the masses in a state of docile obedience. SKY is harvested on the planet of Moloc with huge harvesting machines defended by enemy sky bikers and formidable defense towers. But there exists a freedom underground - proud rebels who would defy their tyrannical masters to be free men. However, they do not possess the military training to operate the advanced weapons systems of the 24th century. Desperate, the freedom underground turns to you, the elite mercenary, the Sky Runner. You are the Squad Commander who must lead your group of Sky Runners through the defending towers blasting the drug crazed enemy bikers and annihilating the harvesting machines. You are a professional, you are paid only for success. You do it for the money - but history will remember you as the heroic warrior who saved mankind from the scourge of SKY", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Cascade Games", "publishers": "Cascade Games", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Runner", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRfKv9wp_us", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109645-sky-runner\n"}
