{"altername_name": [], "name": "Yogi's Big Clean Up", "overview": "Yet another game that was sadly to be caught up in the demise of Hi-Tec Software back in 1992. This was to be a 3rd Yogi Bear game from the company, and was only really known about for the C64 when listed as a competition prize in the Daffy Duck compo in Zzap. The game was fully released on the Amiga and ST. The C64 edition was a conversion that was being done by Ashley Routledge, Martin Pugh and Dave Saunders, started approximately as Daffy Duck was nearing completion. Yogi featured in your typical platformer, spanning across 4 levels where he must tidy up rubbish in Jellystone Park, find parts of a bike in the swamp, find objects for different characters in the film studio and then conclude by trying to find all the pieces of his bed in the underground caves.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "David Saunders", "publishers": "Hi-Tec Software Ltd.", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137794-yogis-big-clean-up\n"}
