{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pitstop II", "overview": "Race Formula-1 in several tracks while trying to beat a computer, or human opponent. Pay attention to your fuel and tires: It will be necessary to drive into a pitstop to swap them out and refuel. Tire damage is indicated by their colour; they start off black and become lighter as they take damage. Once they have turned white, a collision will send the car off the track. Six different tracks are available to race on, including Brands Hatch and Vallelunga. Tracks can be played singly, or all together in a Grand Prix contest. When playing the Grand Prix, this is scored in the same way as the real contest. Players can select how many laps they want to race and 3 different skill levels. This is the first 3D racing game to implement a split-screen simultaneous two-player game mode. Players could be in completely different places on the racing track, and each split screen would show the view of the track according to the player's position.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Epyx", "publishers": "CBS Electronics Software", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.10", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitstop_II", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcJm9_ZzijU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6385-pitstop-ii\n"}
