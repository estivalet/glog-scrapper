{"altername_name": ["Boulder Dash Junior V"], "name": "Boulder Dash Junior 5.0", "overview": "Intended for young and aspiring Boulder Dash fans and the eternally youthful, you must guide Rockford as he digs his way through the underground collecting Diamonds, while also avoiding baddies and being squashed by large heavy boulders. So yes very much like boulder dash, but featuring lots of cool new levels, a lovely loading screen, a great soundtrack, and even more ways to deal with enemies. Hold fire plus push a direction to act without moving. If you can solve all the tasks without the trainer and able to outscore Kermit then you are ready for the standard Boulder Dash games.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2020", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Andreas Kwias", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f36VKT_YXw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/158481-boulder-dash-junior-50\n"}
