{"altername_name": [], "name": "Snow Force", "overview": "A special (and updated) Christmas version of Soul Force. The Soultron star system has been at peace for millenniums, the echoes of warfare long faded, its people living in hope for a never-ending peaceful existence. Yet some had looked out into the skies, wondering what lay beyond, and what dangers could descend upon their peaceful worlds. In secret they developed project Soul Force, an advanced space fighter designed to defend the Soultron system from an outside threat. And from the darkness of deep space comes a terrible bio-mechanical fleet swarming into the Soultron star system, monstrous creations descending upon the peaceful planets, tearing into the ground for reasons unknown. Communication attempts remain unanswered, the invaders obliterating any ship brave enough to approach... and all that at Christmas time!! We have chosen you to launch and pilot the new Soul Force space fighter against this terrifying threat and liberate our star system. Learn our enemy\u2019s plans and put a stop to them for good. The fate of our star system lies in our hands. You are our last and only hope... to save Christmas!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2021", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sarah Jane Avory", "publishers": "Sarah Jane Avory", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://sarahjaneavory.itch.io/snow-force-c64", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/167957-snow-force\n"}
