{"altername_name": [], "name": "Corom", "overview": "The Great Knight, Corom, has been called by Olberand to the land of Peloria to save Princess Diana from the clutches of Targoth, the most evil sorcerer in the land. If you succeed, the Princess has the powers which, when freed, could rid the land of Targoth forever. But you must be wary. Targoth's monsters have the frightening capacity of two strengths; one with which they strike, and one to defend themselves. And, as if Targoth's monsters weren't enough, you must battle or evade Moorugs, Groggs, Skeletons, Lava Monsters, Ghosts, Bats, Witches, Slime Monsters and Spiders. Armed only with your strength, leather armor and 1,000 gold units, you must cleverly barter to acquire the weapons and spells you need to succeed in your mission.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Charles A.
