{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Human Race", "overview": "The Human Race is a single player game with different game styles on each level. The aim of the game is to achieve a high score. This is done by jumping around the screen and collecting objects. Each single screen level is set at a different point in man's evolution and sees the character start as an ape and evolve into a caveman and beyond as the player progresses through the game. Each level is a different kind of mini-game. For example the first level is a platform style game where the player leaps through the jungle eating bananas and avoiding nasty creatures such as dinosaurs, while level two has the player negotiating a path through a lava lake while avoiding falling fireballs. This game is played using a joystick.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "John D.
