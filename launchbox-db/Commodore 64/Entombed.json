{"altername_name": [], "name": "Entombed", "overview": "Entombed is an action-adventure video game developed and published by Ultimate Play the Game for the Commodore 64 in 1985. It is the second instalment of the Pendragon series and is a sequel to The Staff of Karnath. The game features series protagonist and aristocrat adventurer, Sir Arthur Pendragon, as he attempts to escape an ancient Egyptian tomb before all oxygen runs out. As with its predecessor, Entombed is presented in an isometric format. The game was created and designed by brothers Dave and Bob Thomas, with Ultimate founders Tim and Chris Stamper otherwise being uninvolved in development. Entombed took considerably longer to develop due to the re-programming of its game engine. It received positive reviews from critics upon release, with praise being directed at its playability and graphics. It was followed by a sequel, Blackwyche, which was released later in the year.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dave Thomas", "publishers": "Ultimate Play the Game", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.88", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entombed_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFkt2UUhl8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/17455-entombed\n"}
