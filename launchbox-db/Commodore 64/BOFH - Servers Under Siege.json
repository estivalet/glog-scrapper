{"altername_name": [], "name": "BOFH: Servers Under Siege", "overview": "Take the role as of BOFH as you arrive late at work to find your workplace is overrun by a group of insane activists. They have ordered personnel to leave, taken all workstations and servers as hostages and set up bombs in network equipment closets. Of course, this makes you boil with wrath and the only logical course of action seems to be waging war on the activists single-handedly. To be able to enter and conquer back the server room at the 6th floor you must first defuse all the bombs. Cut 3 wires in any order to defuse a bomb. Instructions in the form of wire colors' first letters can be taken from the technicians, who wear green, by force.
