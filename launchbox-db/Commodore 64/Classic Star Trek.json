{"altername_name": ["Star Trek: Star Fleet Simulation"], "name": "Classic Star Trek", "overview": "Created by Terry Flynn, aka Roy Batty, this is an EXCELLENTLY done remake of the well-known star trek simulation. If you have already played the old sims, you already know how to play this one. there are subtle differences between this and those old originals. the game is played on a galactic grid of 8x9 sectors, each sector is cut into a grid of 8x8 parsecs, each parsec is 3.26 light years in size. The simulation begins as a large Klingon armada invades this galactic area... You, Captain of the U.S.S. Enterprise, must defeat this invading force to save the Federation. There are 3 star bases within this galactic area where you can refuel and recharge the ships power and shields. You have short and long range sensors and unlimited photon torpedoes. In navigation .1 will move one parsec, .8 will move one full sector. Good luck and God Speed!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "February 4, 2001", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Terry L.
