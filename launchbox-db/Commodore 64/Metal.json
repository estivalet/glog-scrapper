{"altername_name": ["Stripe"], "name": "Metal", "overview": "After the exhaustion of most energy resources, the existence of the epsilon dimension was discovered, from which waves of pure energy seemed to be coming. Foster prepared his spherosorb craft and explored through the wormhole into the epsilon dimension. With extreme surprise, Foster realized that this strange world with a radial structure was made up of variously colored sectors, some of which are inter, but others rich in energy. Additionally, there were regions dangerously capable of absorbing the energy of the spherosorb. By carefully adjusting the screens and avoiding the clash with the strange inhabitants, Foster found he had to touch the colored sectors to understand their nature. Published in Italy as Stripe in Special Program n.37 (novembre 1987) and Hit Parade C64 n.22 (Aprile 1988).", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Marc Jansegers", "publishers": "Edizioni Societ\u00e0 SIPE", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/122290-metal\n"}
