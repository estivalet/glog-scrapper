{"altername_name": [], "name": "Retro Torque", "overview": "Take Player\u2019s\"Turbo Kart Racer\", jazz up the graphics and change the karts to motorbikes, and you get \"Retro Torque\". This little update by Paul Black was done especially for Commodore Force magazine, but was sadly unused as the magazine went under before it could publish it as a covermount game. (Rumoured to be for one of the missing two issues which never got published). Actually, Retro Torque offers many more options and improvements over the original game, although the music is exactly the same. It\u2019s certainly far better than the original Turbo Kart game, especially with regards to presentation.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Howie Davies", "publishers": "Commodore Force Magazine", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbmf21UOg38", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/160517-retro-torque\n"}
