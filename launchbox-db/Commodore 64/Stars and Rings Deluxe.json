{"altername_name": [], "name": "Stars and Rings Deluxe", "overview": "An improvement to the noted Stars and rings game. You control a star which moves in a circle as long as you hold down the Fire button. If you release the Fire button the star flies off in teh direction it was moving when you released it. The aim of the game is to use the star to collect the rings which appear in the playing area. Sound simple? Look basic? It isn't and this release throws some additional curveballs to make things more interesting.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Peter Staaks", "publishers": "Eagleware International", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/76104-stars-and-rings-deluxe\n"}
