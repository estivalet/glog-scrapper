{"altername_name": ["Crazy Dream Dash 1"], "name": "Crazy Dream 1", "overview": "A Boulder Dash style game where, like De Luxe Caves 3 and above, you can and must move diagonally in order to solve the game screen and move to the next one, unlike previous C64 games in this genre. But like other games in this style you have to dig through monster infested caves in search of diamonds. In each level you must collect a certain number of these diamonds, in order to open a portal to the next stage. Enemies can be squashed by falling boulders, which are released when the ground below them is removed or they are pushed onto empty ground, but be careful because these can also squash you. In later levels, difficulty is increased by many puzzle elements and shorter time limits. Most sites don't have a date for this release, but since it came out in conjunction with the Marek bugfixes and Version 2 Packer and it was the first of that type allowing diagonal movement it should be 1988. It is very likely that Crazy Dream 1 through 5 all came out at the same time.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Marek Roth", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/126278-crazy-dream-1\n"}
