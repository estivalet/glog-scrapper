{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gravity III: The Final Rescue", "overview": "The last ever game in the Gravity series, featuring much nicer graphics, with special thanks to Zeitgeist/Civitas. Your mission is to pick up medical cargo from the delivery ship above Planet Zerox. Then deliver the cargo to the Lunar HQ, by landing on the landing pad. Unfortunately your mission will be quite a tough one, as an evil alien empire knew about your delivery. So they decided to send a load of their assorted alien ships to guard the planet and smash into you. While you are landing your space craft, make sure you avoid collision with the alien ships, otherwise you could lose a life. This game was entered for the game compo at the Vision 2003 Party, and won the competition.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2003", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hiram K\u00fcmper", "publishers": "The New Dimension (TND)", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/102806-gravity-iii-the-final-rescue\n"}
