{"altername_name": ["Ball-Fever"], "name": "Ballfever", "overview": "So far, the c64 has largely been spared the dinosaur fever. Ball-Fever is now seizing the opportunity and is spreading at breakneck speed on all bread boxes in Germany. This game is an addiction! The gameplay is very simple. You control a small ball that, thanks to its elastic properties, has the ability to develop enormous bounce from standing. You have to guide the cute ball through numerous levels and protect it from all kinds of monsters. Slimy snails and jumping monsters have to be avoided. The highlight of this game: It is played on two levels. For example, if you have bitten yourself above the surface of the earth, you can try to pave your way underground. Although the difficulty level is quite low at the beginning, you should be careful not to underestimate the game. It is all too easy to maneuver yourself into a hopeless situation. Have fun!Published in Magic Disk 64 1993/12.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "December 6, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hannes Sommer", "publishers": "CP Verlag", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VaDvSs8hBE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/87810-ballfever\n"}
