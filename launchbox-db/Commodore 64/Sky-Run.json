{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sky-Run", "overview": "Published in 64'er Sonderheft 42. Race as fast as you dare but avoid the black blocks and stay on the safe path. The crowning glory of every pilot's training: a low-level flight over an unknown spaceship. Only the best pilots avoid all obstacles in time. Will you be accepted into the galactic elite troop? Joystick acrobats get their money's worth with Sky Run. Daring maneuvers and a good eye are the prerequisites for surviving in the fast-paced race against time. Training to become a combat ship pilot usually takes three years. The task given in the final exam is not easy. After being dropped from a mother ship, you race your glider just above the surface of a training ship. Right from the start it is important to keep your eyes open and the control stick (joystick) firmly in your hands.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Stefan Behme", "publishers": "Markt & Technik", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pnE0o7Zz5k", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/127635-sky-run\n"}
