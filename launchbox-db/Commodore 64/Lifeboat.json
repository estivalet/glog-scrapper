{"altername_name": ["Lifeboat: A Waterlogged Adventure"], "name": "Lifeboat", "overview": "Lifeboat, also known as Lifeboat: A Waterlogged Adventure, is a text adventure that tests your seafaring skills for the Commodore 64. It was developed by Anthony Mario and published in Commodore Magazine 1989/04, as well as in Loadstar #059. Lifeboat is a small interactive adventure game which has most of the features you're accustomed to in text games. You use verb-noun commands like \"Go House' or \"Take box\". If you want a two word noun, such as oil can take the second word, eg. \"Take Can\". Common text adventure abbreviations like N,S,E and W work instead of the full directions and U and D for up and down also work. Now you just need to figure out if you are on an ocean liner or a spacecraft.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Anthony Maro", "publishers": "Commodore Magazine", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/121520-lifeboat\n"}
