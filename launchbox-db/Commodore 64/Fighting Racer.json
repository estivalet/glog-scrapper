{"altername_name": [], "name": "Fighting Racer", "overview": "A shooter released in 1993 in 64'er Sonderheft 97. Horror Grand Prix. As a \"Fighting Racer\": You sit in the cockpit with a machine gun and a pump gun: the Formula I racers of the year 2093. Anything that gets in their way will be blown away! Nigel Mansell and Michael Schumacher never dreamed that Formula 1 races in 2093 would be run with such malice and hidden fouls as in our game. The tires squeak, the engine glows. You're sitting in the car and have just covered 500 miles (but not the one from Indianapolis). Although you didn't make any driving mistakes and didn't have to deal with any technical difficulties, you only crossed the finish line in 13th place. You know exactly why: the other drivers used nothing but illegal tricks to win. Purely by coincidence, the car in front of you suddenly lost 6l, another overtook you, although theoretically it couldn't have been that fast with its measly engine - if all the usual safety devices were on board. You, on the other hand, have always kept to regulations and agreements, have always driven fairly, because you wanted to prove that you can also win like this, only \u2014 you never made it! You had better change tactics quick and fight dirty or you'll never make it to the finish line alive!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Markt & Technik", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/100886-fighting-racer\n"}
