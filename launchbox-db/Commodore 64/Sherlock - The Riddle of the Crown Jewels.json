The interaction with the game world is performed by typing combinations of verbs and objects. Descriptions of locations must be read carefully, as they may contain clues vital to solving the game.

But here you are, outside the Baker Street residence, and not a moment too soon; for the fog has thickened and travel without a lamp has become impossible.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bob Bates", "publishers": "Infocom, Inc.", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/104142-sherlock-the-riddle-of-the-crown-jewels\n"}
