{"altername_name": ["Tank: No Peace"], "name": "Tank (CP Verlag)", "overview": "A two-player only duelling game published in Magic Disk 64 1990/12. The war in 2500 could look like this: The mutually hostile heads of state meet in cozy surroundings and have a glass of beer to decide the war by joystick on an old c64. War victims would be a thing of the past and. . . MANIAC FRED'S great-great-great-great-great-grandchildren would (finally?) Be our Federal Chancellor! Well, the prospects are not so rosy after all! So that you can still get an idea of how our descendants (maybe) wage their wars, we present you: TANK - NO PEACE! During the game, make sure that your DAMAGE ad does not \"go beyond the limits\" and that your FUEL does not hit rock bottom. Should this happen, the opponent has won in any case", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hans-Joachim Nolte", "publishers": "CP Verlag", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/131981-tank-cp-verlag\n"}
