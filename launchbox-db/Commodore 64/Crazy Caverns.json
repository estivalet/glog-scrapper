{"altername_name": [], "name": "Crazy Caverns", "overview": "Something's seriously wrong in Christmas Town! A group of rebellious elves has gone on a rampage and stolen some of Santa's finest presents. As if that weren't enough, the gifts have been stashed in caverns below St. Nick's workshop, where they're guarded by crazy mechanical snowmen. It's your job, as Santa, to recover the presents. As you search, you must tread perilous ice bridges adn snow packs, where miscalculation means a long, long drop to the ground. You must also confront crazy snowmen and misshapen Christmas trees, and you'll find events irritationgly unpredictable. Crazy Caverns features five screens, one for each cavern where a present is hidden, and five difficulty levels, each one giving you less time to search than the one before. When you find a gift and touch it, a magical sled appears which is not always easy to get to. Touch the sled and it will transport you to the next cavern. You'll need a keen sense of timing and good distance judgement to succeed at Crazy Caverns - and you can't afford to dally, Christmas Eve is almost here!
