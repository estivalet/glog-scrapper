{"altername_name": [], "name": "Iron Horse", "overview": "You play the role of a cowboy who must stop train robbers from escaping on trains on various stages. The game is viewed from the side at an elevated angle as you walk left to right along the train with the screen scrolling as you move. There are two routes occasionally to take and this is along the actual train or along the roof. Before you start your mission you can select from one of three weapons, fist, whip or pistol with each giving you a different ability. You are also armed with a limited amount of a special weapon which allows you to throw a blanket of fire along the floor, killing all who touch it. As you walk along, various cowboys will appear and each need killing or avoiding as touching one or getting hit by their weapon loses you one of three lives. Lose all three lives and you start the game again. The cowboys trying to kill you range from just simply running around to ones with various weapons and these include guns, whips, fire and dynamite. Scattered around the train are bags of gold which can be collected for extra points. At certain parts of each stage your route is blocked and you must withstand an attack by a various amount of cowboys. Once all cowboys have been killed then you can continue on your way along the train collecting a huge pile of gold.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Icon Design Ltd.", "publishers": "Konami, Inc.", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.08", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3t-fzR7v-hI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75918-iron-horse\n"}
