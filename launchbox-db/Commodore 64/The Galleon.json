{"altername_name": ["A G\u00e1lya"], "name": "The Galleon", "overview": "A very complex graphic/text adventure game, developed for the main Commodore platform (C64/128) in style and manner reminiscent of the Level 9 and Melbourne House adventures (sometimes even referred to as the \u201cHungarian Magnetic Scrolls\u201d today). It contains an intelligent parser (applying a vocabulary of about 1400 words and inflexion for the twisted Hungarian grammar as well as the English translation of them), more than 250 rooms (with detailed descriptions and a few dozens of pictures), nearly 100 living creatures and nearly 140 moveable objects. Moreover, it is a unique multi-protagonist one: you need to play it with two player characters at the same time (a young magician and a barbarian who are brothers on an island) constantly switching over between them and working together as a team. It has even got some minor MUD-like and RPG elements (like spell power or trading treasure, dark labyrinths and random events etc.).", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "R\u00f3bert Oless\u00e1k", "publishers": "Molotow Cocktails", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/101933-the-galleon\n"}
