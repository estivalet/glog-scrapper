{"altername_name": [], "name": "Miami Vice", "overview": "In this spin-off from a popular TV cop show of the 1980s, Crockett and Tubbs are trying to smash a drugs ring bossed by Mr. J. You have to start at the bottom, initially busting the casual dealers before reaching their suppliers, and ultimately the casino-dwelling honchos. This is done through a combination of driving and shooting, through an overhead rendition of Miami. When crooks are stopped they will often provide valuable information, although sometimes they can only be stopped by shooting them.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "January 1, 1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Canvas Software", "publishers": "Ocean Software Ltd.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Vice_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8n3fTBpDNQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/18437-miami-vice\n"}
