{"altername_name": [], "name": "Colouration", "overview": "Do you dream in color? Be warned you might not be able to escape this dream even in your sleep! A deceptively simple game, all you have to do is match the block which appears at the bottom left of the screen to an area in the main grid above. Move the white marker around and press fire when you are in the right place. In each round you have to locate ten blocks within a certain time limit. If you choose a place that is the wrong color one of the squares on the block is blanked out, so don't guess too much. In two player mode it is a battle to see which of you finds all your blocks first.
