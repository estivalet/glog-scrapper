{"altername_name": [], "name": "Lazarus", "overview": "Lazarus is a platform game, where you control a soldier whose mission is to collect 5 items scattered around 5 levels. You start the game in a small chamber; when you go to the right, you'll receive info about which item you must bring back, and a code to put into the teleportation machine nearby so that it moves you to one of the levels. The levels are all divided into screens rather than side-scrolling fluidly. Once you teleport, you must find the item and then make your way to the exit teleporter. On you way, you'll face obstacles: electric barriers, which harm you, and water which kills instantly. Your enemies are two robots (blue and pink) who drop down from the sky in each screen shortly after you enter it. The robots harm you when they touch you, but you can shoot them with your gun. Sometimes, they'll leave behind a bonus, which you can collect to get more health or ammo. The robots walk left and right mindlessly, but can drop down from platforms.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Inflexion Development", "publishers": "TimSoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/159478-lazarus\n"}
