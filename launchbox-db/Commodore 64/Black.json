{"altername_name": [], "name": "Black", "overview": "Black is played on a board divided into squares. Players take turns filling the squares with tiles that are marked with pathways. There are three different tile designs to choose from. After each turn, a marker (represented by a heart symbol) begins travelling down the vertical pathway in the top left square, and continues until it comes to a blank square. This blank square is the next one the player must fill. Play continues until 1 player loses by making the marker go off the board, or by making it go into the bottom right square (marked by a *). This game was developed and published by Island Software in 1983.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Island Software", "publishers": "Island Software", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.64", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/88448-black\n"}
