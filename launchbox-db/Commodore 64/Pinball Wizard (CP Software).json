There is a single table, featuring 2 sets of flippers at the base, and 4 bumpers on each side, allowing for multiple ricochets. Above these are a set of scoreless bumpers, each of which has a gap in between and a letter above, which spell out 'Sagittarian' along the top - hit them all to turn them into bonus lights.
