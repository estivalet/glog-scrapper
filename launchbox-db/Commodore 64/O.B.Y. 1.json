{"altername_name": ["OBY1"], "name": "O.B.Y. 1", "overview": "This Commodore 64 game from 1991 experimented with motivation-enhancing subliminal suggestions. The player operates a robot and has the task to seal radioactive leaks with stones. This is done either in single player mode or simultaneously with a second player. The two-player levels can be solved in a team or played as a duel. Some tasks are skill exercises, others are puzzles. For the 1-player mode, 10 scenarios with increasing difficulty are available, for the 2-player mode 20 scenarios. These can be selected directly. If a robot is hit several times by its opponent or by falling stones, it loses its upper part. This can be restored in the regenerator.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Andreas Mettler", "publishers": "Magic Soft", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.B.Y._1", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwEc9nMtWOc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75993-oby-1\n"}
