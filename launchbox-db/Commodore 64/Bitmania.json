{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bitmania", "overview": "Bitmania is a single screen top view shooter where you move around a screen destroying as many Bits as you can on your journey to the Central core of your Commodore 64. Your ship is inside a data-bus amongst the Neuron Flow and you must keep shooting the Bits and when shot they leave behind a Pod which also needs shooting over various waves. Once you have shot enough Pods then you move to another wave but if you are hit by a Bit then you lose one of three lives. Before the game you can select the speed (1-3) with one being the slowest, and the skill level (0-29) with the higher skill levels having more Bits on screen.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kieron Brennan", "publishers": "Virgin Games", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/88446-bitmania\n"}
