{"altername_name": [], "name": "Special Operations", "overview": "During World War II a highly guarded compound has been photographed by a reconnaissance plane hidden in a forest. After many intelligent reports it has been discovered that under the compound is a research complex which is getting nearer to the development of a bacterial virus and a new type of rocket which when combined will cause devastation and disease. You and a team of four, have been tasked to parachute into the forest in the surrounding area of the compound to find it's location, then get in the compound before trying to enter the complex. Once in the compound you have to get the plans for the virus, rocket fuel and guidance system before finally blowing the place up. Once your mission has been completed you must then get to a rendezvous point to be picked up by a plane. Remember though, the surrounding areas have patrolling guards and the compound and complex are heavily guarded. Before you start you can pick from seven missions where each one is more difficult than the last one. The first mission is just to find the compound and photograph it while the last mission is where you have to actually blow up the complex and reach the rendezvous point. You then choose how long in hours (1-9 times ten) the mission will take before the plane arrives. Each movement in the forest is worth 20 minutes while inside the compound it is 2 minutes. Once you are happy with your selected options you must pick a team of four soldiers to attempt the mission with yourself. There are 30 skills to choose from in which you as the leader have all 30 but the other soldiers only have two of them. You are only aware of one skill for each soldier so you can interview each man to find the other skill or just select them. Each interview will take a day but you only have eight days before the mission starts.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Keith Hunt", "publishers": "M.C.
