Each player commands a fleet of spaceships and tries to conquer a randomly calculated galaxy, which on many planets is already inhabited by neutral peoples (natives). At the beginning each participant chooses his home world. The first player then enters his commands (\"from which planet to which fly xx spaceships) invisibly. In the status window he can then see his worlds with an overview of production rate per year and the stock of ships. The game ends after a given number of game years (10 - 999). The a report is created to find the winner. This game is the forerunner to Advanced Space Battle.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jan B\u00f6ttcher", "publishers": "More.Gore Software", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/129111-space-battle-deluxe\n"}
