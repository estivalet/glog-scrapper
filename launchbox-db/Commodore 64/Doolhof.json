{"altername_name": [], "name": "Doolhof", "overview": "Doolhof is a 2D maze game in Dutch. The player navigates a maze and must find the exit. Added difficulty is that the player can only see a fraction of the maze, so exploration is required. The game keeps track of the players coordinates, the number of steps made and the duration spent in the maze. There are also teleporters that bring the player back to the starting position.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jan v.
