{"altername_name": [], "name": "WarGames (Coleco)", "overview": "Greetings, Professor Falken. Shall we play a game? This strategic game is based on the popular 1983 movie of the same name, starring Matthew Broderick. It might remind people of Missile Command but the action is slower and spread over six screens which represent different areas of the U.S.A. Enemy missiles, planes, and subs will attack and you must direct your own forces, which include missiles, planes, subs, and satellites, to intercept them. Each type of defense has strengths and weaknesses (missiles are fast but limited in range, planes are slower but have unlimited range). Satellites are a better all-around defense but are only available every so often. Some weapons aren't available in certain areas, and some enemies are resistant to certain weapons, so you must alter your strategy accordingly.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "July 15, 1984", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Paul Jaquays", "publishers": "Coleco Industries", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBmlAa9qFWI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/7457-wargames-coleco\n"}
