{"altername_name": ["Road Raiders", "Motor Massacre", "Road Raider"], "name": "RoadRaider", "overview": "It is the future, and a holocaust has swept over the world. Now, in a post-apocalyptic environment, you are set to destroy the evil Dr. A Noid, who had turned people to zombies with his artificial food called \"SLU\". First, you drive through the city with your ATV, destroying enemy vehicles and avoiding mines and gun turrets. There are several buildings you can explore. In those buildings, you walk from room to room in a gauntlet-style setting, shooting zombies and avoiding traps. You'll find ammunition, food, and hopefully the pass to the Arena. The Arena is the third part of the game: This is a deadly destruction derby where you have to steer your ATV through the treacherous maze and destroy all the enemy vehicles by pushing them into the holes in the ground. After surviving the Arena, you'll proceed to the next city - until you get to face Dr. A Noid himself.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gray Matter Inc.", "publishers": "Gremlin Graphics Software", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.12", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JVfu8TmWGE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/111995-roadraider\n"}
