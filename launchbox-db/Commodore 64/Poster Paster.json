{"altername_name": [], "name": "Poster Paster", "overview": "You play the role of Bill Stickers, a billboard paster. You paste the billboards across town, to display the advertisements on the paper you are pasting. You must take the rolls of paper and stick it down to the billboard. If the paper is in the right position it will stick, if not it falls down. Make sure your ladder is in the right position, and do not lean too far off the ladder. Do not touch the wazzocks which move along the ground, they will electrocute you. Fortunately, they will disappear if you shoot them with your paint.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Andy Walker", "publishers": "Taskset", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.02", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPLoM38wYkU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109843-poster-paster\n"}
