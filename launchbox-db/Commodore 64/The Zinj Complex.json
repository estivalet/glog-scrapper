{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Zinj Complex", "overview": "A 2D adventure arcade game by Michael Svendsen. In 1993, an orbiting satellite passing over the southern part of North America detected unusual signs of head radiating from a small area in the Arizona desert. Connected to underground caves of hot water, the U.S. Government sent a team of scientists to the site. The team reported back of a huge underground complex and decided to investigate. Three days later, during which nothing had been heard from the team, a single scientist was found lying half dead by local inhabitants. He was rushed to a nearby hospital, but, alas, too later. Paramedics attending the poor man were able to question him before he expired. (Intel report will follow.) Now in 1994, it is your job as crack-specialist of the secret American anti-mad-scientist team to infiltrate what is presently known as the Zinj Complex. According to legend, Zinj was a hidden city said to exist in the middle of the Congo rain forest. In the 13th century, rumors of large blue diamonds in Zinj were flourishing yet no one ever managed to retrieve anything of value from the city. Today, the lost city is commonly known as King Solomon's Mines, owing to Mr. H. R. Haggard's book of the same name. You will be equipped with the latest in military hardware and defense. Intel suggests energy boosters can be found within the complex. It is highly recommended that all hostile activity on the separate levels is disposed of before the timer runs out or you will end up being neutralized yourself!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Michael Svendsen", "publishers": "LWTCDI Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBO44tpjIRA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138954-the-zinj-complex\n"}
