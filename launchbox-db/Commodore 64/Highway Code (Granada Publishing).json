{"altername_name": [], "name": "Highway Code (Granada Publishing)", "overview": "Sorry, we don\u2019t have a green giant to help you across the road or help you solve any of the questions in this game. This program is designed to make sure that you know the (UK) driving code before you begin to take your cycle out on the open road. It will also help you to keep your parents out of trouble as you can tell them where they shouldn\u2019t park their cars. The first thing your jolly green computer will ask you is your name which you should enter and press RETURN. You will then be given a series of questions with three answers to each. You must choose the correct one if you want to get points and, in real life, stay alive on the road. Once you get the hang of the game you can modify it to your local driving codes and add additional questions.
