{"altername_name": [], "name": "Catacombs (Ion Intenational)", "overview": "Published in Ahoy! magazine 1987/01 (Issue #37), and also in COMPUTE!'s Gazette 1994/11. This is a rogue-like dungeon crawler. Being the ardent treasure hunter that you are, you had a hard time resisting the stories about the Catacombs of Darkness and the fantastic caches of gold hidden there by the mysterious builders of the underground fortress. Armed with only a torch, you descended the steps leading down to the catacombs without hesitating, ignoring the weird cries emanating from the dimly lit crypt, images of bulging chests of ill-gotten lucre swimming in your mind. Your purpose on each level is to avoid the traps and monsters, get as many gold chests as possible, and find the key that unlocks the door leading to the next level. On the first five levels, this is relatively easy, since the catacombs are illuminated. But on the next five levels the lights arc out, and the only things you can see are the objects which arc within range of your torch. It takes an extensive search, as well as caution, to avoid the traps and monsters while you look. There are five types of critters living in the catacombs: skulls, wizards, bats, spirits, and snakes. There are three of these guardians on each level, and they are quite intelligent and relentless in their efforts to catch you. If one of the monsters catches you the game ends.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Cleveland M.
