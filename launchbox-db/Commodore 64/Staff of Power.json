{"altername_name": [], "name": "Staff of Power", "overview": "Many years ago, when Arcon became King, the Gods gave him a Staff Of Power. It was filled with strong magic for good or evil but King Arcon has always used it for honest purposes and has been a wise and just ruler. But one day, in the guise of a beggar seeking justice from the King, the evil magician Zyx swiped the Staff from the King's hands. Immediately, Zyx revealed himself in his true form, cursed the King for his goodness and vowed to destroy the kingdom. You have been chosen to regain the Staff and destroy Zyx but first you must find four magical weapons; a sword, shield, ring and war horn.
