{"altername_name": [], "name": "Micro Mouse", "overview": "Micro Mouse is a top view maze game where the screen scrolls up or down when you move a robot to repair the circuits of a super computer. The powers-to-be who own the computer feel that it is a waste of time sending in trained engineers to solder broken parts of the circuit when small robots containing a cyber brain can do the job themselves. You have been tasked to train a robot in the shape of a mouse by moving the robot around the circuit manually, repairing broken sections so that it will learn the job in hand. To repair a broken section you must move over one of various red crosses containing solder tracks with a certain shape track appearing below the playing area. If you don't require that shaped track then you move over the cross again until the track you need appears.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "M.C.
