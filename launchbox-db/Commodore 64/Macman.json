As you eat the dots, there are three ghosts also moving around the maze and these have to be avoided because if you touch one then you lose one of three lives. In each corner are power-pills and when eaten allow you to eat the ghosts for a short period of time.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Program One, Inc.", "publishers": "Dotsoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/121645-macman\n"}
