{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tales of the Cat", "overview": "Players control a cat whose task is to survive the dangerous obstacles that everyday cats must face. The game is divided into two sections. In the first section, players must guide the cat to the road to collect an important item while avoiding getting run over by cars, and hazards that occupy the footpaths such as foxes, people, light bulbs, pot plants, and more. In the second, players have to make their way to the other side of the screen by jumping over creatures, avoiding bird droppings, and crossing rivers. Each screen needs to be completed in a certain amount of time. If the cat is hit by an obstacle, a life gets lost. The game is over when all of them are lost.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "John Meegan", "publishers": "Budgie [Alligata Software]", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MNV6eJVjus", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/114054-tales-of-the-cat\n"}
