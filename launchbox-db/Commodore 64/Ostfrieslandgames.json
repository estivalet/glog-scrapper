{"altername_name": ["Ostfriesland Games"], "name": "Ostfrieslandgames", "overview": "A parody of competition games like Winter Games and Track & Field where competitors challenge each other in cow milking and fishing skills. Created by Markus Faber and published in Golden Disk 64 1993/05. An obvious send-up of California Games, this is another humorous collection of competitive sporting events with a certain \"local\" character - this time set in Ostfriesland, Germany, where the collective taste in sports is apparently rather quaint. Popular regional games include cow milking (in which other cow products may be tossed into your opponent's bucket), shooting pigs (out of the sky), bike riding (with square wheels), teabag throwing, and (for that adrenaline-pumping extreme sports kick) competitive roof-building. The above events blend playing against the clock, against the computer, and against another human player; you may practice each one individually or, if particularly lacking in self-respect, play the full set in a row. As with Blood 'n Guts, be ready for a lot of joystick waggling.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Markus Faber", "publishers": "CP Verlag", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdtCDF6FdRo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/123249-ostfrieslandgames\n"}
