{"altername_name": [], "name": "Eerie Mansion", "overview": "A text adventure by R. Wilson and released as part of \"Adventure I\" game pack. Adventure games are not fast action arcade style games, but inter-action games where you tell the computer what you want it to do. Part of the fun is discovering what words the computer understands and what you are supposed to do. It is always a good idea to examine everything and look for clues that are not very obvious. You should probably make a map as you go through the adventure so you won't wander around the same places. Sometimes you can't get to a certain area unless you open, take or move an object. If you do such moves be sure to look again to see if any new directions are available. This game accepts commands of a few words such as go north, open the door, kill monster, look, etc. Find the treasures and solve the mysteries of the Eerie Mansion, but beware the perils that lie within... Now proceed if you dare!!!!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "R.
