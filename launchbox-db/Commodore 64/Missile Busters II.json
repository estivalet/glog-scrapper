{"altername_name": [], "name": "Missile Busters II", "overview": "A collect-em-up style game. Your planet is under threat by falling missiles. Therefore it is up to you to collect those missiles into the Missile Compaction Container - again.. The only way to survive is to NOT let the contamination damage counter reach 100% otherwise your planet is doomed. There are various power ups which could be handy or useless. Left + Right arrow objects will expand your container's length, so that collecting missiles is easier. Avoid the bomb power ups, otherwise say bye bye to your home planet. :o)", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2000", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Richard Bayliss", "publishers": "The New Dimension (TND)", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75972-missile-busters-ii\n"}
