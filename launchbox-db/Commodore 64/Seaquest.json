{"altername_name": [], "name": "Seaquest", "overview": "This is a remake/conversion of the Activision Atari 2600 game Seaquest for Commodore 64. The aim is to rescue stranded divers, avoid sharks and enemy submarines, and not run out of oxygen. You can refill your oxygen by going to the surface at the cost of one diver. If you surface with no rescued divers, you lose a life. However if you surface with six divers, you get a nice bonus based on how much oxygen you have left. This is called a \"round\". After each round the enemies become faster, their number increases, and destroying them gives you more points. After two rounds an enemy sub starts patrolling the surface too. You gain an extra life every 10000 points, maximum six in reserve. Use joystick in port 2 to play. If you are using an emulator, make sure the borders are enabled and visible. Except for a couple of minor details, the original Atari 2600 manual applies to this port.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "December 3, 2021", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "H4plo", "publishers": "itch.io", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtube.com/watch?v=_2CU42roo6c", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/157147-seaquest\n"}
