{"altername_name": [], "name": "Chimp Chaos", "overview": "You've heard the saying, \"A bull in a china shop\". Well, a bull does very little damage in a china chip, it just stands around, really. It stands and admires the Wedgewood. But a chimp, a happy little chip just wants to have fun. And fun for him consists of throwing things and watching them smash to pieces. It could cast you a fortune. So you had better catch the monster before...OH NO! He has the coffee cups, *CRASH*SHATTER*CRACK*! Chimp Chaos...A game of fun and desperation. Scoring is based on the amount of china left after you have captured the chimp. Try to guard at least one piece of china so you stay alive for more levels.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "General Masters Corporation", "publishers": "ALA Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/116413-chimp-chaos\n"}
