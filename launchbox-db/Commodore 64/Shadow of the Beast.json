{"altername_name": [], "name": "Shadow of the Beast", "overview": "Shadow of the Beast is a side-scrolling platform video game produced by Reflections and published by Psygnosis in 1989. The original version was released for the Commodore Amiga, and was later ported to many other systems. Shadow of the Beast is considered revolutionary at the time, because of its graphics, with many more colours on screen and up to twelve levels of parallax scrolling backdrops, were of a level rarely if ever seen before in action games. It was also notable for its atmospheric score composed by David Whittaker that used high-quality instrument samples. Shadow of the Beast was followed by two sequels, Shadow of the Beast II in 1990 and Shadow of the Beast III in 1992. A remake is in development for the PlayStation 4.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "DMA Design", "publishers": "Ocean Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.14", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_of_the_Beast", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_GdJiEjSho", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/24837-shadow-of-the-beast\n"}
