{"altername_name": [], "name": "RollerBall", "overview": "A variant of the arcade game QIX, in Rollerball the objective is to trap the ball the game is named after by filling 75% or more of the playfield using your 'space scriber'. If the ball comes in contact with you or your trail before you finish closing off the section, you lose a life. The primary difference between Rollerball and the original is a pair of 'Squeezer' enemies that move along the outlines of areas you have filled in.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Ocean Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgWFupPvEug", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/89251-rollerball\n"}
