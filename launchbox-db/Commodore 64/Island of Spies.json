{"altername_name": [], "name": "Island of Spies", "overview": "You thought this was an island paradise....Nick didn't tell you it was crawling with spies. As you bring in your plane, both engines are hit by enemy fire. You scramble for the parachutes they're here somewhere and drop into the rushing wind. And the heart of the enemy stronghold. The adventure begins in the plane and leads into the heart of the enemy camp. You must return to the aircraft, but make sure your side isn't fooled by your disguise. In Nick Hardy Adventures you instruct the computer in short phrases, usually verb-noun. Eg. if in the adventure you see a painting you want to take then you would enter Get Painting. When entering your commands you may use the Delete key to erase letters. You can type INVENTORY any time to see a list of things you are carrying. In each location you may find objects which you can use and manipulate in further locations to help you progress.
