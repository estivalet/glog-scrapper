{"altername_name": ["Arenum"], "name": "Rage", "overview": "A Dueling Shoot'em Up game for 2 players only. Work out your aggressions. Good, good, let the anger flow through you. The war between the Omega and the Theta galaxies fails to resolve in favor of either of the two contenders and so it was decided to have the two best pilots of their respective armies face off in a duel to the death. These two pilots are you and a friend of yours who will have the courage to face you. The weapon supplied is for both of you a star fighter with two laser cannons. The place is the Arenum created at the boundary between the two galaxies. The hour is high noon. You can face each other all over the screen and the winner is whoever embraces their rage and hits the other 20 times. Published as Arenum in Italy in both Hit Parade C64 n.73 (dicembre 1992) and Special Program n.90 (settembre 1992).", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Amok Developments", "publishers": "Amok", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/RLrMNN2SG2c", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/124998-rage\n"}
