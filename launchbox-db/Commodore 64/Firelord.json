{"altername_name": [], "name": "Firelord", "overview": "The land of Torot has been oppressed by the Evil Queen; fortunately you (as Sir Galaheart) are on hand to put things right. Initially you have no weaponry as you progress through the 500 screens of Atic Atac-influenced streets and towns, but fireballs can be collected and used against the Queen's forces. Trading is a large part of the game, a unique aspect for a game of this type at the time. While many objects are lying around, many more must be obtained by entering the homes of people, and negotiating with them to arrange a swap. You can also attempt to steal from them, but you risk being caught and sentenced to death (losing a life in the process).", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "John Cumming", "publishers": "Hewson Consultants", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjDjUjeUqOs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/101142-firelord\n"}
