{"altername_name": [], "name": "Droid Void 2", "overview": "Released in Computer Gamer 1987/05 (Issue #26). You droid is in a void inside the C64. Well, not completely a void as there are plenty of nasty creatures to keep it company. Apart from the relatively harmless griblets, there is a satellite floating around the screen . Hit this with a laser and you'll set up a bar across the middle of the screen which will catch the griblets. Hit the satellite a second time and the bar dissappears allowing the griblets to fall. Hit the satellite again before they touch the bottom of the screen to blast them to smithereens. Avoid the blue circles, which can rob you of your life essence if you collide with them.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Frank G.
