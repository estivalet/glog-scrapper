{"altername_name": [], "name": "Logic (CP Verlag 1995)", "overview": "A game by Piotr Malisiewicz and published in Magic Disk 64 1995/10. Concentration is required here when it comes to recreating the right square exactly and under time pressure. On the right side of the screen you can see the template. This is how your Quadrat (on the left) should look like at the end, and since it isn't like this when the game starts, it's time to roll up your sleeves and let's go. With a joystick in port 2 you can steer the small arrow horizontally and vertically back and forth between the four columns of your square. At the push of a button, the row to which the arrow is pointing is shifted by one position. You must now try to move the rows as cleverly as possible so that the entire square resembles the example on the right. Since the whole move is also subject to a strict time limit, you don't have much time to ponder and think. Another tip: to get the arrow from the horizontal to the vertical, you have to move it all the way to the right on the top and simply press the joystick down. The arrow then switches automatically.
