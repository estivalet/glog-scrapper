{"altername_name": ["Drilling"], "name": "Hell for Leather", "overview": "Hell For Leather was a game being developed for Audiogenic by James Macdonald under his Psycodelic Software Developments label. It was the first game he had ever written, and was done to prove to someone at his local computer club that multiple levels of parallax could be done smoothly. Initially it started off as a single scrolling street scene, and then became a full game. The game was pretty much completed, but never got released due to someone claiming rights on the game\u2019s name, and then the game was stolen and leaked from a booth at a games convention in London. So the game never got officially released by Audiogenic, which is a shame \u2013 as it is a good piece of work by James which deserves a look to show what he could do given no tight deadlines. Published in Italy in Special Program n.50 (gennaio 1989 and in Hit Parade C64 n.32 (Marzo 1989).", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Psycodelic Software Developments", "publishers": "Audiogenic Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yQd0u6ozBo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/104437-hell-for-leather\n"}
