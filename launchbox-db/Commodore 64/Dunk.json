{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dunk", "overview": "Published in COMPUTE!'s Gazette 1986/04 (Issue #34), Dunk will challenge any previous conceptions you may have had about your joystick. Pressing up may move your player down, while pressing left may move you riht. And just when you think you have the pattern mastered, it changes! The gameboards consists of 3 square platforms, stack one on the other. Each platform has 4 edges, which you must avoid. Anytime a ball falls off the edge, it is lost forever. The top two platforms have holes through which a ball can fall to the next level. During the course of the game, 25 balls enter the playing field from the top of the screen. Each lands somewhere on the top platform and begins to roll towards either the left or right edge, whichever is farthest away. The object of the game is to steer the balls into the openings so they fall to the next level. When a ball reaches the bottom platform, try o knock it into one of the scoring slots on the righthand edge. A ball over the edge gives no points.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kevin Mykytyn", "publishers": "COMPUTE!
