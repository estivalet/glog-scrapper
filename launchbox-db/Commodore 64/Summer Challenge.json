{"altername_name": ["Summer Olympiad"], "name": "Summer Challenge", "overview": "You've trained hard for this moment. Now get ready for record-setting excitement as you compete in five events that test your skill and experience. En Guarde: suddenly there\u2019s a new point to fencing. Stretch to the limit as you vault the Hurdles. Hit your mark in the High Dive. Push yourself that extra inch in the Triple Jump. Then take aim and shoot for the gold in Skeet Shooting. If you\u2019ve got what it takes, you\u2019ll wear gold this summer. Five events are on offer in this Olympics-style sports game. These can be played individually or as part of a complete tournament, with the chance to choose your nationality first. The events are Hurdles, Triple Jump, Skeet Shooting, Diving and Fencing. Each event's control system involves rotating the joystick and pressing fire at the correct moments. The Fencing is viewed isometrically, and the skeet shooting from a 3D view positioned behind the competitor, which typify the unusual approaches taken to the events, rather than filling the game with 10 or more generic by-the-numbers offerings.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tynesoft Computer Software", "publishers": "Microvalue", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.39", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eqTDc90g8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/32128-summer-challenge\n"}
