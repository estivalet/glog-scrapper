{"altername_name": [], "name": "Eye of the Gods", "overview": "Now available for the C64 - Eye of the Gods. Take part in a perilous journey through ancient ruins on a quest to find the near-mythical Eye of the Gods, an artifact so powerful it could solve the energy problems of a civilization on the brink of collapse! Use the special abilities given to you in your morphing power-suit to survive the hazards you encounter on your journey ... The survival of mankind is depending on you! In the distant future, Mankind has evolved technologically - but this development came at a price: The resources of the planet were gradually depleted to the point that civilization was left on the brink of collapse. Ancient legends tell that in the origins of civilization, in those times where history is confused with myth, humanity possessed an artifact of great power known as the Eye of the Gods. Some believe it is a mystical object that connects with other dimensions; others believe it is an inexhaustible source of energy. To calm the voices who plead for the artifact to be recovered, the Army sends one man, you, to infiltrate the ancient ruins of the Cradle of Civilization with one single purpose: Execute a desperate mission to find the Eye of the Gods, and to save humanity from it's own extinction.
