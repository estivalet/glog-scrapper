{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sonar Search", "overview": "...Sonar reports the \"whine\" of torpedoes running towards you. You kick the destroyer's rudder full-right and order flank speed. As you watch, two torpedoes cross your bow. Sonar returns quicken and you close on the submarine below. Suddenly, bearing to target shifts 180 degrees and the sonar return is instantaneous. THE SUB IS DIRECTLY BELOW! You stab the firing button and watch as 6 depth charges arch into your wake. Several long seconds pass before they explode, sending six domes of white water to the surface, along with bits of the sub that nearly got you. But congratulations are brief as four more subs are lurking out there somewhere, trying to escape into the open ocean. Sonar search is a fast action strategy game based on anti-submarine warfare. You are the commander of a group of 4 destroyers sent to intercept a pack of 5 enemy submarines. Equipped with sonar gear and depth charges, and aided by submarine sightings from other ships and aircraft you must get directly over a sub to score a hit with your depth charges.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Thomas B.
