{"altername_name": ["Spriteman 64", "Sprite Man 64"], "name": "Sprite Man", "overview": "In this Pac-Man clone, your task is to navigate a maze eating dots while avoiding Zippy, Stilty, Gippy, and Chris, four ghosts who also move around the maze. Contact with any of these ghosts results in loss of live. However, eating power pellets allows you to eat the ghosts who respawn near the center of the maze. Fruit can also be collected for bonus points, and eating all the dots in the maze advances you to the next maze.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ian Gray", "publishers": "Commodore Data AS", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETwWswNHKGs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/95135-sprite-man\n"}
