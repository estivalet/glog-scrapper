{"altername_name": [], "name": "Flash!", "overview": "A platform maze style game written by Peter Kaul and published in 64'er Sonderheft 49. In it, you control the Greybeard who must catch the Pac-Men before they get to the pipes at the bottom of the level and avoid or destroy the monsters all the while. As the levels increase in difficulty there will be more monsters. To destroy a monster you have to hit it with a flash of lightening from the cloud at the top of the screen. It will be attracted to you so be sure not to get hit, too! The monster will be stunned for a few seconds and you only have three to work with per screen so be sure to use them sparingly.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Peter Kaul", "publishers": "Markt & Technik", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtube.com/watch?v=ncGEe6YgO6k", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/101208-flash\n"}
