Various enemies hinder progress and can be killed using an upgradable weapons system based on bouncing balls and a flamethrower. Extras and 'diamonds' can be collected from shooting or otherwise destroying rocks and walls. There are two playing modes available, one player or two players. Extra lives will be earned depending on the number of diamonds collected. Warp Zones and hidden entrances allow access to secret zones in the levels. Each world ends with a boss monster.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "May 18, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Rainbow Arts", "publishers": "Reline Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.19", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PUSlM6p_Gk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/17879-hard-n-heavy\n"}
