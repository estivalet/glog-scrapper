Randall (lord land serf) and released in 1985 by CW Communications, Inc./RUN in the RUN Gamepack Disk, and then later in Binary Zone PD. Not a bad early RPG, for one written in BASIC. Most notable is the use of bizarre enemy names such as Iron Claw, Mugwumpus, Blue Smurf, Purple Pox, Megadonkey, Moon Devil, Slime Hulk, Pulverizer, Mad Hacker, Bystander, and even Programmer who appears towards the end.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Fred S.
