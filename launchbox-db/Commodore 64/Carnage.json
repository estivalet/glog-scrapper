And if you want to see the next track you must win your race; if you can't, unfortunately the game is over! In total there are 18 tracks. After every race you earn 800 pounds, and go to a shop where you can buy necessary things for your car like nitro and mines, or equipment for upgrade.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "David Sowerby", "publishers": "L.K.
