{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Quest of Merravid", "overview": "You are Merravid, son of Aranoid and you have been asked by Dwarves in the land of Thargon to retrieve their magical firestone. After being lost for many years it has been tracked down to a mountain and guarded by a dragon. The Dwarves tried and failed to get it back and have now asked yourself to try but not until you wear the correct armour. Only one set of armour exits in the land though and it is scattered throughout the land and you have to collect the pieces before you can face the dragon. The Quest of Merravid is a text adventure with the screen having text describing your location and you type in commands with the keyboard to interact with your surroundings.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Guiseppe Denicora", "publishers": "Martech Games", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/121954-the-quest-of-merravid\n"}
