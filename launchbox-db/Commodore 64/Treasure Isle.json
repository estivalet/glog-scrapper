{"altername_name": [], "name": "Treasure Isle", "overview": "Avast, me hearties! Shiver me timbers as well, but rub some soothing balm on them shortly afterwards, or things could get a little uncomfortable for me. Its a wonder how the pirates understood each other, actually. You could get into some pretty nasty scrapes on the high seas if you took one of those requests too seriously, some very nasty scrapes indeed. One such scrape is the swashbuckling search for the Treasure Isle, and from that point the enormous stash of goodies that lie hidden on it. Will our intrepid adventurer reach his goal? Will untold wealth and riches follow. Only you (and the two word parser) will decide. Treasure Isle is a text adventure where you work out the best solutions to some foxing puzzles using only your will, cunning, lateral thought and keyboard skills can protect you!
