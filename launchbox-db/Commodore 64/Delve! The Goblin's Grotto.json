{"altername_name": [], "name": "Delve! The Goblin's Grotto", "overview": "DELVE! is a procedurally-generated action rogue-like with a tiny smattering of Eye of the Beholder (if the Beholder was a pack of nasty goblins). QUICK-START (haha!) INSTRUCTIONS Hunt your prey through the dungeon by using: W = step forward/attack a goblin directly in front of you A = strafe one step left S = step backwards D = strafe one step right Q = rotate 90 degrees left E = rotate 90 degrees right IMPORTANT!: When you arrive on a new level you automatically drop a special GROUNDING BOTTLE that you will then later pick up (well, walk in to, as you cant move the BOTTLE) to instantly teleport you to the next level. Unfortunately, due to poor planning on your part, it looks exactly like all of the other potion bottles scattered around the dungeon. You can only activate the GROUNDING BOTTLE once you've taken care of at least HALF of the goblins on the current level. You'll know when you can use the BOTTLE as you'll see your portrait shouting a battle cry when he thins out the evil denizens of a level. (You've remembered how to get back to the room you started in where the BOTTLE is, right?) BEWARE!: The GROUNDING BOTTLE will be destroyed if you kill a goblin while it's standing over the BOTTLE, leaving you trapped forever!!
