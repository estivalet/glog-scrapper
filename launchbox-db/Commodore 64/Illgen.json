{"altername_name": [], "name": "Illgen", "overview": "A Qix action game puzzle variant published in 64'er Disc 1990/01, and also in 64'er 1999/07. The player's task in Illgen is to gradually fill an area with an image by dividing off individual segments. \"I know you!\" you will say. That's right, the idea comes from the classic Quix, but has been expanded here with many new features and hardly has anything in common with its predecessor. Countless enemies make life difficult for you. The divided surface segments are not just simply filled in, in each case the section of an image becomes visible. If you have filled an area to at least 75 percent (the corresponding display at the bottom edge of the screen then turns turquoise), you can display the exposed image completely by pressing F5. Then comes the bonus round. Here the player expects a Reversi - conversion. The task is to place the game pieces in such a way that they are horizontal, vertical or diagonal enclose as many of the opponent's stones as possible. In the game itself, you can shoot down the opponents for a short time by pressing the fire button. By collecting different letters and symbols you get extra lives, more shots, etc.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sebastian Broghammer", "publishers": "Markt & Technik", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5UdZMlBbhE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106180-illgen\n"}
