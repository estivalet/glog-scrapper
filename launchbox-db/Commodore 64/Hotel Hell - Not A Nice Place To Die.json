{"altername_name": ["Hotel Hell"], "name": "Hotel Hell: Not A Nice Place To Die", "overview": "It's winter out at the hotel. You're the caretaker and are responsible for keeping the hotel and surrounding grounds clean and tidy. Throughout the whole period of your employment with the hotel you have never experienced a winter as bad as this. The whole place has been completely covered with a thick blanket of snow; so bad that the entire hotel staff and occupants (except you) have left the hotel for the entire winter. Fine, not a problem, you told yourself... until the strange occurrences started; occurrences so bad that you were soon fighting for your life to survive the hidden horrors of the hotel. Your goal is simple, to get out of the place as quickly as possible... alive.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mario Moeller", "publishers": "Mario Moeller", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIyMfDVFVmY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75904-hotel-hell-not-a-nice-place-to-die\n"}
