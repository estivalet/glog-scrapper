{"altername_name": [], "name": "Little Hop", "overview": "Published in both 64'er 1992/03, and 64'er 1996/08. In the logic game Little Hop by Tobias Erbsland you have to remove all the tiles from the screen. It's not as simple as it looks: You can only get the idea on the board from the plates. If there is a gap between the two plates, this must be jumped over with a super jump. If you run out of Super-Jumps and step next to a plate, the game is over. On the playing field, you see after the starting and pressing the fire button, the plates in three colors and a big profit. If you step on a light blue tile, recycle it. If you land on a yellow place, it becomes light blue. You have to step twice on such a plate to make it disappear. At a violet plate you get a super jump. In the space next to that Playing field you see the time running out. The upper single number shows the current level, the lower one the number of Super Jumps.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tobias Erbsland", "publishers": "Markt & Technik", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/102837-little-hop\n"}
