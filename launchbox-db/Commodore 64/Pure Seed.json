{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pure Seed", "overview": "Published in the German game magazine, Game On 1991/04 and also included on \"Kangarudy II\". Your task in this horizontal shooter is to get the ball to a higher level. To shoot you must release the ball, you can catch it again by touching it and holding the button. You only have a certain number of bounces before you lose. So you must let it bounce to destroy the enemies and then grab it up again. The ball shows up on your RADAR in case you get caught up in a battle. You can reach a higher level by entering all of the zones marked by a cross in the lower left display. Some opponents will grab up your ball and take it far away.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hans Ippisch", "publishers": "CP Verlag", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6G9DyyS8fg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/124511-pure-seed\n"}
