It certainly doesn\u2019t mean crap, although it can! Craptastic can mean ludicrous, bonkers, outrageous, funny, wacky, far out, and silly. The theme simply implies that the compo was just for a bit of fun, not a serious coding competition. Competitors were welcome to make an excellent game to submit for the compo, or games that contain some humor or silliness to fit more with the theme, but they didn\u2019t have to! The competition was limited to 4KB. Yes, any entry submitted could be no more than 4KB when compressed!
