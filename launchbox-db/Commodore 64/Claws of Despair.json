{"altername_name": [], "name": "Claws of Despair", "overview": "Claws of Despair is a traditional text adventure made using the Quill adventure generation software from Gilsoft with some graphics. You tell the game what you want to do via a textual interface and the parser is based on a verb / noun input. You are the son of a noble house and the task at hand is to retrieve the Staff of Sarfrin for your king and people to save the land . You go into your quest with nothing but the star of Thorgrim to protect you, without which you will not be able to touch the staff you seek. The premise is a rather standard fantasy fare, along the way you will come across wizards and dragons and then must face the villain who guards the staff.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Peter Iveson", "publishers": "Players Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90763-claws-of-despair\n"}
