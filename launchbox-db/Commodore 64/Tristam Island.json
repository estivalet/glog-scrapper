{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tristam Island", "overview": "TRISTAM ISLAND is a text adventure made from the mold of Infocom; expect a large geography to explore, lots of prose, a rich parser, diverse puzzles, some humor and some darkness. To use Infocom's classification, I'd rate the game's difficulty as \"Standard\"; however, the game's design is modern and eschews all the frustrations commonly associated with 1980s text adventures. No hunger timers, no frustrating mazes, no blocking situations that force you to restart!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "May 21, 2020", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hugo Labrande", "publishers": "itch.io", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/168024-tristam-island\n"}
