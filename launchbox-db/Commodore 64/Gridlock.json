{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gridlock", "overview": "The goal of Gridlock is simple, reach the arrow at the bottom right hand of the screen with your simple diamond shaped character, while avoiding the solid circle and donut shaped characters, and also avoiding the timer from running out. However, with every level, the \"enemy\" characters get faster, and more \"intelligent\", resulting in the game's frustration level increasing with every level. Despite its simple graphics, the gameplay is solid enough to appeal to those that value solid gameplay over fancy graphics.
