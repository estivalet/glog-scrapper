{"altername_name": [], "name": "Elon", "overview": "Published initially in 64'er 1988/09, and later in both 64'er Sonderheft 37 and in Commodore Scene #14 (1997), this action game Elon, created by Edgar Furkert and Uli is about a race of electrons against protons in an electrical circuit. If the electron in the game Elon isn't constantly on guard, he rarely achieves his goal. It is not easy to move your electron through the intricate paths of a long electric circuit. Three protons race through the labyrinth at great speed and destroy the electron when they collide.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Edgar Furkert", "publishers": "Markt & Technik", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURT6DT2jCQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/98302-elon\n"}
