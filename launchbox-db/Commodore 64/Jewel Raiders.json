{"altername_name": [], "name": "Jewel Raiders", "overview": "In this side view single screen game, you are part of the Galactic Jewel Raiders and you have entered a vault to steal two jewels and put them through the Green Window. Starting at the bottom of the screen, you must make your way to the top of the screen, collect a jewel and head back down to the bottom. Between you and the jewels are forcefields that move across the screen with gaps in, forcefields that turn on and off, and finally two guards, either side of the screen that head towards you or move up and down. You are able to shoot sideways to kill them, but another one appears. If you touch a guard or any forecefield then you lose one of three lives.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Program One, Inc.", "publishers": "Dotsoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/107230-jewel-raiders\n"}
