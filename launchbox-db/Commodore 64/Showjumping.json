{"altername_name": [], "name": "Showjumping", "overview": "The animated simulation of a show-jumping event. The player must control a horse and rider over the various obstacles of a show-jumping course, either against the clock, on faults, ore even both. These obstacles includes walls, water jumps, five bar gates and many more. Skillful judgement is the key to a successful round. Make sure the horse is in just the right position and jumps not too soon, so landing on top of the jump, or too late and clipping the top bar with its front hooves. Movements are graphically complex and accompanied by a whole host of sound effects. Jump well and the crowd will go wild.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Pete G.
