{"altername_name": [], "name": "Plutonium", "overview": "A 2 player only , simultaneous strategy game created by Boris M\u00fcller and published in Magic Disk 64 1993/01. After starting the program, the screen shows an atomic lattice that can be moved with the cursor (joystick in port # 2). Each atomic nucleus has 2, 3 or 4 electrons, depending on the position of the screen. They are all colored gray (neutral). If the first player selects an atom in port # 1, it and one of the electrons turns red. Now the second player in port # 2 can select an atom with the fire button. After all, it is a matter of coloring all electrons on an atom by alternately clicking them against another player. If a fully colored plutonium is selected, it swashes over the neighboring atoms and thereby also colors opposing atoms. The overloaded atom becomes neutral again (gray) after the explosion. By tactically placing the electrons, you can trigger chain reactions that wipe out your opponent on the field with one blow. Atoms that have already been colored can no longer be be clicked.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Boris M\u00fcller", "publishers": "CP Verlag", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/124206-plutonium\n"}
