{"altername_name": ["Le 5 Axe", "The 5th Axis"], "name": "The Fifth Axis", "overview": "The year is 2140. Working from his artificial satellite orbiting around Saturn and helped by his faithful army of cyborgs, Professor Gern B. Dick has successfully designed a time-travelling machine. As a way of testing his new invention, he travels to different time periods to collect iconic historical items. Suddenly the machine malfunctions and explodes, scattering parts (called Anachronons) in 10 different locations and time periods. As a side effect, it appears that the destruction of the machine also distorted the space-time continuum and the existence of the very Universe is now at risk. The player's mission is to collect the artifacts from different time periods that have been scattered around the 16 floors and the 10 levels of the lab and to retrieve the parts of the time-travelling machine that ended up in the Past. In the lab, the hero can run, jump, hit and kick cyborgs. Elevators let him go up a floor and keys will let him access areas that are outside of his reach.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Activision", "publishers": "Loriciels", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13HQfQXFQDA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/100619-the-fifth-axis\n"}
