{"altername_name": [], "name": "Castor", "overview": "A puzzle game similar to Columns that was published in the German magazine Game On in their 1995/03 issue. Castor is a falling block puzzle game similar to Columns. Stones consisting of three blocks of varying colors drop down and have to be arranged in the right way. Pressing the fire-button will rearrange the blocks that make up a stone. At least four blocks of the same color have to be lined up vertically, horizontally or diagonally in order to clear them. The more stones are cleared at once, the higher the score. A level ends after a set number of stones (which increases with every level) has been dropped. Every 10,000 points the speed of the stones increases. If the stones reach the top of the screen, the game ends.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bj\u00f6rn Stenberg", "publishers": "CP Verlag", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLYNjk7_G9c", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75425-castor\n"}
