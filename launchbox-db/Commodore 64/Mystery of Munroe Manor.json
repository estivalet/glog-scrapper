At that time, he shunned reporters and quickly fled the docks in a private coach, bringing with him a large cargo of crates, sea chests, and artifacts. Rumors suggest that he fled to his country estate in the west. Basil must search Castle Kreep where he resided, searching for clues regarding Munroe's behavior, as to his whereabouts.
