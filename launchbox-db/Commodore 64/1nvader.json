{"altername_name": [], "name": "1nvader", "overview": "1nvader is very simple yet challenging space shooter developed by Darren Foulds in 2019 for the Commodore 64. It's similar to Space Invaders except you have only one alien invader to kill. However, as a result of this, the single invader is made harder to kill than the invaders in the typical Space Invaders clone, making the game a bit more challenging.
