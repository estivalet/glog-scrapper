{"altername_name": [], "name": "Weatherwar II", "overview": "In this artillery game, an enhanced clone of Ouranos!, feuding sides settle their disputes with aggressive weather patterns. On opposite sides of the screen, two players with some pull over local weather conditions take turns assaulting each others' castles with their pick of hail, rain, lightning or tornadoes. These attacks emanate from an itinerant cloud drifting variously across the top of the screen, and must be directed by a numerical \"charge\" value intended to account for a shifting wind speed and the location of the cloud. The winner is whichever party completely obliterates their opponent's abode first.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bob Carr", "publishers": "Magic Carpet Software", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsZUjhgasSM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/135386-weatherwar-ii\n"}
