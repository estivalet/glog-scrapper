{"altername_name": [], "name": "Nevets", "overview": "Nevets is an action game developed by Steven R. McCloskey and published by COMPUTE! Publications, Inc. in COMPUTE!'s Gazette 1984/04 (Issue #10). A clever action game, \"Nevets\" requires both strategy and a lot of dexterity with your joystick. In \"Nevets,\" you are transported to the Land of Adnerb, where your mission is to protect four power capsules against the ever encroaching Nevets. Your only defense against the thieving Nevets is a turret gun, which you control with your joystick. The screen displays a lower and an upper level, with two power capsules at the center of each level. The Nevets may approach from right or left on either level. The turret, at the bottom center of the screen, can be moved up and down with the joystick, and the gun can be aimed by moving the joystick left and right. Pressing the fire button fires the gun. There are 40 levels of play. You must destroy your quota of Nevets (displayed on the screen) within 60 seconds to get to the next higher level. When you meet the quota, you receive a bonus of the time remaining times ten. The game ends when time runs out or all four power capsules have been stolen. You then have the option of playing again. The game also keeps track of high score.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Steven R.
