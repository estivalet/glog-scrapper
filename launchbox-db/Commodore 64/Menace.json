{"altername_name": [], "name": "Menace", "overview": "Six ruthless dictators have collaborated to create the planet Draconia, which contains some of the most gruesome and harmful life-forms imaginable, all indulging in some rather unsavoury actions. Thus, you must go in your spaceship to destroy them all. The game is a side-scrolling R-Type-influenced shoot 'em up consisting of six visually-diverse levels. Waves of enemies come towards you to be shot, and reveal tokens, which when shot at will cycle through several available weapons. These include lasers, cannons, improved ship power and a shield.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mr. Micro", "publishers": "Psyclapse", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menace_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fAy5lpMl_g", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/96681-menace\n"}
