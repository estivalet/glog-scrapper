{"altername_name": ["Malermeister Klecksel"], "name": "Painter", "overview": "An action game created by Thomas G\u00f6smann and published in Computronic 1985/01-02. A house wall needs to be repainted. Paint and brushes are provided. Now try to completely paint the facade of the house with new paint. You can steer your character to the right, left, up and down. There are three characters available for each game. To successfully complete the game, dodge the somewhat strange-looking residents of the house. They will definitely try to finish the painting early. So - pay attention and stop working in time, otherwise you've lost the game. A tip: don't just try to compete against the strange residents of the house, but also against the clock. If you managed to completely dress the facade in a new color, then come to the next picture", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Thomas G\u00f6smann", "publishers": "Computronic", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/76032-painter\n"}
