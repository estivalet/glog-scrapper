{"altername_name": [], "name": "Spellbound (MAD)", "overview": "Magic Knight's second game (after Finders Keepers) sees him travelling through time to rescue 8 people, including his tutor Gimbal, who have become locked in time thanks to a faulty spell. The game invented a whole new control system, essentially pioneering the use of icons and windows in adventure games. You control a pointing finger, which can be moved onto each of the menus to reveal sub-menus, which contain the main options for object manipulation. All objects can be examined in detail, which produces a visual display of them, and possible clues as to their usage. You must look after your character's health and energy levels - carrying too many objects will progressively weaken him. You must also look after and direct the trapped characters once you locate them.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "David Jones", "publishers": "MAD (Mastertronic's Added Dimension)", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spellbound_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWuzLDTJvcc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/100925-spellbound-mad\n"}
