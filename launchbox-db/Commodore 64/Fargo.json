{"altername_name": [], "name": "Fargo", "overview": "A graphics adventure game created by Robert Mundschau and published in Loadstar #086. The game will challenge you to move from left to right, level to level, dodging all sorts of dangers. Welcome to the 2-Dimensonal universe of Fargo where and unusual species of creatures called Orbytes live. What bakes Orbytes unusual is that they live their lives in a constant state of vertical motion, bouncing up and down between the square trees that also populate the universe of Fargo. But live for Orbytes is not just bouncing, it's filled with many hazards. Like Spiker trees that can pop an Orbyte like a bubble, and lava pits that can fry you to a crisp. Then there's the worst one of all the dreaded Lava Snakes jumping out of the lava pits to snatch an Orbyte for dinner. Despite the dangers of Fargo, the Orbytes have managed to build themselves a peaceful forest community free of danger. But the peace was shattered with the death of the King Orbyte. Without a lead the community has fallen into chaos. Now a new leader must step forward and prove himself by crossing the Valley of Fire. The Valley of Fire is a narrow pass between two huge lava pits, filled to the brim with Snakes and Spikers. Now it is time for you to take on the King's Quest and bring peace to the Orbytes again. Move left and right while bouncing. Guide the Orbyte from the left side of each screen and off the right side completing the level. When moving line yourself up with a tree to bounce off of and go the other way to avoid going into the lava. Fargo has 15 levels of play.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Robert Mundschau", "publishers": "Softdisk Publishing", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/100342-fargo\n"}
