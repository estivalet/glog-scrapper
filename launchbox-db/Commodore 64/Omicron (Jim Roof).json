{"altername_name": ["Cannone Laser"], "name": "Omicron (Jim Roof)", "overview": "A mix between space invaders, a wave shooter with the added cross-hairs element that increases the difficulty somewhat. Destroy the space invaders before they reduce your spaceship to a fistful of cosmic dust. They line up in combat order according to their ranks. They dive towards you trying to hit you and then com back up to prepare for a new attack. Keep your eyes peeled, as their movements are unpredictable and this makes them extremely dangerous. If you manage to destroy the entire fleet, a new wave of increasingly fierce aliens will appear to harass you again.
