{"altername_name": [], "name": "Aerosol", "overview": "From the creator of the notorious \"Stroker\" Bob Carr comes Aerosol. In this game your character is a can of bug killer, and you must kill as many bugs (represented by Asterisks) as you can before you run out of pressure. The can of bug spray can only be moved up and down using the Q and L keys, respectively, but any other key stops the can from moving. Then pressing any other key (other than Q and L) releases the spray", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bob Carr", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivYmLYiruoY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/123052-aerosol\n"}
