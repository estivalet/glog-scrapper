{"altername_name": [], "name": "Touch", "overview": "A simple German language implementation of Ralph Baer's electronic game Simon (itself an adaptation of Atari's ill-fated Touch Me); iconic symbol of the '80s, the game rules are so primitive as to be practically instinctual -- each button is associated with a tone, and the player's goal is to reproduce button-sequences produced randomly by the computer, growing by an additional press with every iteration. The challenge lies in seeing for how long the player can faithfully reproduce the expanding sequences without making a mistake.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jan Lindenberg", "publishers": "Europa Computer-Club", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/123866-touch\n"}
