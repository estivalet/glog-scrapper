Part I:- titled \"Spellbound\", Jonny battles against witches with the help of his leprechaun. Part II:- titled \"Bangers and Mash\". Jonny must feed his canine colleage keeping and eye on the mischievous jimpys at all times. In Bangers and Mash, you control Jonny who needs to collect three sausages and take them to his dog, Mash, while avoiding enemies known as Jimpys. If you come in contact with one of the Jimpys, then the sausages are stolen and you lose a life. If a Jimpy follows you around, you can either pass through a series of gates that will alter the path or drop a maximum of two sausages. But if you choose to do the latter, you cannot pick up the sausage again, it will disappear in a few seconds, and you receive less points than you do giving all three to Mash. You will advance a level when you have given Mash all the sausages in the current one. The game ends when you run out of lives.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Rawalls", "publishers": "Ocean Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBAVuP4g5Yk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/88107-jonny-and-the-jimpys-part-ii\n"}
