{"altername_name": [], "name": "Exor", "overview": "You need to match the two figures on the screen. The red stones transfer to the green no problem. Or is it? \"Exor\" - an extremely tricky puzzle created by Frederic Thiesse and published in both Happy Computer 1989/04, and in 64'er Sonderheft 54. Puzzle games are as popular as ever. This sharpens your ability to combine and tests your stamina. Brain teasers can also be difficult. \u00bbExor\u00ab lets you set the level of difficulty yourself. Everything looks so simple: a seemingly easy task is approached with a shrug. Suddenly it turns out that one had not reckoned with the treachery of the object. The task at \u00bbExor\u00ab is also relatively easy. After all, it can't be that difficult to copy a figure from red squares congruently into the adjacent green squares. Have you ever calculated how many possible variations a matrix of 8 x 8 fields offers?", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Frederic Thiesse", "publishers": "Markt & Technik", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/99878-exor\n"}
