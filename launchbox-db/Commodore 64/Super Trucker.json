{"altername_name": [], "name": "Super Trucker", "overview": "A split screen side view\\overhead view racing game published in both Magic Disk 64 1991/11, and Game On GE 1993/2. Where are they, the heroes of the highway among you? At SUPER-TRUCKER, capable truck drivers are needed who have their truck under control at all times. Do not worry, a driver's license is not required. SU-PERTRUCKER is a truck driver game. Your job is to drive the truck back and forth between two factories, always picking up or delivering a container. Of course, there are countless adversities that make life difficult for you to properly carry out your assignment. First of all, of course, there are the other drivers, all of whom drive as if they had won their driver's license in a hand of poker. They race, build a row of rear-end collisions, and randomly and suddenly change lanes. It also seems civil war seems to be raging in the state in which the action takes place, as tanks now and then try to shoot the truck off the street. . . The game really does not lack for hazards and difficulties.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Laurens van der Donk", "publishers": "CP Verlag", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jyt2dauKQl0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/131679-super-trucker\n"}
