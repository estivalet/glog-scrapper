{"altername_name": [], "name": "Steel Thunder", "overview": "\"Steel Thunder\" is a simulation of the tanks M60A3, M1A1, M3 and M48A5. Each of the three additional members of the crew of the tank can be chosen anew for each mission. All members have their peculiarities and special amenities. During the mission you can switch between driver, gunner and commander view any time (the assistant gunner is always simulated by the program) and take over the controls yourself or just give commands as commander. After a training operation you go to scenes in Cuba, Syria or Western Germany for combat operations and there you will notice quickly, that one does better not drive directly through the hostile lines, but focus on the aims from afar as well as you can, destroy them and only then proeceed further. The one who sees the other first, is the winner most of the time. In this simulation there are many keys occupied by important functions, that means that the training period is rather long, but if you do not spare this effort, will have fun for a long time (also due to the career file, which contains the reached rank, the finished missions, the exact breakdown of the shot hostile units and the list of medals of every player and is saved on disk) with this presumably best tank simulation for the C64.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tom Loughry", "publishers": "Accolade", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9O12l3FU8E", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/63024-steel-thunder\n"}
