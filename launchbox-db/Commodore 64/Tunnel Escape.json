{"altername_name": ["Escape or Bust"], "name": "Tunnel Escape", "overview": "Steer your hot air balloon through the tunnel to safely escape. The game plays like a more complex lunar lander. You must move through the cave system in your balloon without your wobbly hot-air balloon hitting any of the cave walls. You must avoid them and land the balloon. There is a time limit in force for all levels. Bonus points are rewarded for each safe landing. 4 balloons per game. Graphically by the standards of the other games in the collection it is well done.
