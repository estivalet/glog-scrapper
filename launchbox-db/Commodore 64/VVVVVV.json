Your crew have been teleported away, and it's down to you to get through this world of strangeness and rescue them. Beware though, it may look like a minimalistic platformer, but the gravity will drive you insane as you swap from top to bottom avoiding some of the hardest platform puzzles known to man. A game that will put your skills to the test.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2017", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "", "developers": "Paul Koller", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/169336-vvvvvv\n"}
