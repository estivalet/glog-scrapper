{"altername_name": ["Slums"], "name": "Vendetta (Bratpack)", "overview": "A nicely done crosshairs shooter, with dark, brooding street scenes. The story is set in 1930's America, the era of prohibition and famous gangsters. You are a little gangster who has to make his name and the \"Piazza\". You must therefore contend with your rivals for dominance over the neighborhood and to do so you must annihilate all the members of these gangs. To do this you must shoot all the armed figures that appear on the opposite building. They can be small and well hidden but a small arrow will help you by indicating the direction to move your crosshairs. You have a limited supply of bullets and time, so don't waste any! Once a gang has been defeated you will have increased your money with which you can trade in alcohol or buy new weapons or enemy detectors. You can also take a short break of a few days to see if there is no new business coming up.
