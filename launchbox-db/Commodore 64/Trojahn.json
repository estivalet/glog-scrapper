{"altername_name": [], "name": "Trojahn", "overview": "Released as a sample of the \"Shoot Em Up Destruction Set 2\". The final game in the SEUDS 2 compilation is TROJAHN, a horizontally-scrolling adventure in which you are on a quest to rescue your beloved Elena from an evil Minotaur! During your adventure you will encounter many adversaries including spear wielding Spartan warriors, Cyclops, deadly spikes and the dreaded Minotaur! An interesting feature of this game is the game display. All the in-game action takes place on the left-hand side of the screen in an arcade-style vertical area and the right-hand side of the screen is used to display eye-catching interlude screens. Trojahn is a fun adventure romp that will have you yelling \"THIS ... IS ... SPARTA!\" at your TV screen!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2011", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Chris Yates", "publishers": "Psytronik Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eO2pF_oPuug", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113496-trojahn\n"}
