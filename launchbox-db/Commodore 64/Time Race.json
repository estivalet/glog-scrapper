{"altername_name": [], "name": "Time Race", "overview": "Time Race is a miscellaneous action game for the Commodore 64. It was developed by Karin Liebig and published in Input 64 1987/11. The aim of the game is to bring a small ball over a race track to the finish line as quickly as possible. The ball must not touch the course boundary or any of the moving or unmoving obstacles. If he does, you lose the ball and start again from where you started; A total of six balls are available for all five levels. If the ball, coming from below, has rolled into the hole marked \"Goal\", you can continue with the next level. If you have completed all five levels, you can repeat the whole game with an increased level of difficulty. People who are more curious than sure-footed can look at the different levels of the game by pressing the left arrow key; and if things get too hectic for you, the F1 key will keep you quiet until you press the keyboard again. You can play either with a joystick in port 2 or with the AZ and / keys, which (in this order) correspond to the directions up, down, left and right.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "November 1, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Karin Liebig", "publishers": "Verlag Heinz Heise GmbH", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/368300-time-race\n"}
