{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pac-Wor", "overview": "What would you get if you put Pac-Man and Wizard of Wor in a blender with a side of Kriszti\u00e1n T\u00f3th (Krissz). You'd get this 2-player only 2021 hybrid PD game. This looks to be a good Arcade homage for those of you who remember the classic from 1982. As not only does it have all the dot chomping goodness you could want in a Pac-Man Arcade game, but unlike the original Arcade game, in this one the Ghosts have been replaced by Burwors from Wizard of Wor, and each one when eaten after gobbling up a big pellet gives you points depending on the Burwor being eaten.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "November 14, 2021", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Krissz", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smQ7k2bzLSY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/166391-pac-wor\n"}
