{"altername_name": [], "name": "Escape from Death", "overview": "Published in Computer Gamer 1985/06 (Issue #03). You have to guide your ship through the screen collecting various objects, then escaping through the escape door. This may sound easy, but the planet you have been transported to, Nilgypon, has hostile aliens and a special type of radioactive electricity which attacks stationary objects (like the ones you want to collect), which will kill anything which makes contact with them, so you have a 50/50 chance of collecting the object. You start off in HI gear which can be switched to LO gear by pressing the fire button.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gary Biasillo", "publishers": "Argus Specialist Publications", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/99395-escape-from-death\n"}
