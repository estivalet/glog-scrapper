{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ritter Erik", "overview": "Released as part of Computronic 1985/07-08 and in a two-pack release with Jungle. Knight Eric, the hard fight for your castle begins! On a beautiful, bright blue afternoon in the Middle Ages, you stand on the battlements of your castle and enjoy the wonderful view of your peaceful country. Peaceful? Take a look down the castle wall! The warriors of an envious neighbor are actually trying to storm your castle! After recovering from the initial shock, grab rocks and try to stop the enemies from climbing up. Should one of them manage to cross the castle wall, he will throw you down into the moat. After you've managed to repel the first wave of attacks, the conquerors will regroup and try to hit you with lances. At the beginning of the game you can choose whether you want to slip into the role of a knight, a lord of the castle or a king, which of course affects the level of difficulty.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Thomas G\u00f6smann", "publishers": "Tronic-Verlag GmbH", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/118399-ritter-erik\n"}
