{"altername_name": ["Stairway to Paradise"], "name": "Escape from Paradise", "overview": "Escape from Paradise is a platformer where the screen scrolls when you move the hero Joe, who has decided to escape a vast maze by reaching the top. To help Joe, he must climb ropes, ladders (which turn on and off), stairs and use lifts or springs while avoiding various creatures or obstacles. The creatures move around small sections of the maze and if touched then they deplete his energy shown by a gauge. Also hindering Joe are platforms that move left or right, up or down, with some disappearing, and water which also depletes Joe's energy. Joe has a weapon but no charge so balls have to be collected to charge it up and balls can be found as energy reserves. When the energy gauge is empty then it is game over but if you have an energy ball then it refills.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "TS Software", "publishers": "Anco Software Ltd.", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uTLdeFVelo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/99399-escape-from-paradise\n"}
