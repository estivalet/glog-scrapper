{"altername_name": [], "name": "Killwarp", "overview": "A flood of radioactively contaminated meteorites thunders unstoppably towards the earth. Can the catastrophe be averted? A game by Oliver Kirwa and published in both 64'er 1989/01, and in 64'er Sonderheft 66. It was exactly 11:45 p.m. when the scientist Dr. John Trendham of Mount Palomar Observatory jumped out of his chair in front of the star screen as if stung by a tarantula: A bright flash on the monitor indicated an explosion of unprecedented proportions within our solar system! Excitedly he searched with the Computer control system the coordinates of the flash of light. No doubt: the super nova was exactly at the position of Saturn! What had happened to this planet? But you don't have time for speculation now.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Oliver Kirwa", "publishers": "Markt & Technik", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109180-killwarp\n"}
