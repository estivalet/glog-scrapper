{"altername_name": [], "name": "Kidnapped (SoftSide Publications)", "overview": "You have been kidnapped! You awaken on the ninth floor of a strange building to find that your kidnapper has left you unattended. You must try to escape from the building one floor at a time. Each floor is independent of the others. You cannot carry items from one floor to another and you cannot return to a previous floor. Everything you need to escape from a given floor can be found on that floor! This makes you feel like you're playing nine mini-Adventures rather than one big Adventure.
