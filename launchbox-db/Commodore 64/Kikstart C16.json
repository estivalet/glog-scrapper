{"altername_name": [], "name": "Kikstart C16", "overview": "This game was the source of much confusion due to the fact that Kikstart C16 is a C64 port of the C16 version of Kikstart, and not a C16 cartridge. This motorcycling stunt game where you have the option to test your skills in a one player game against the clock. The object of the game is to guide your rider as quickly and carefully as possible through three out of the eight courses you get to choose from before each race. 16 courses that have to be done in order with five lives. Every course has its own level of difficulty and a unique layout of trees, car's, bus's and pools of water for you to avoid by jumping your bike over. You can use your joystick or keyboard to accelerate, decelerate, wheelie and jump your bike from start to finish.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2007", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jason Kelk", "publishers": "RGCD", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnUKHXmoXx4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/118089-kikstart-c16\n"}
