{"altername_name": ["Magnum Force"], "name": "Powerama", "overview": "Powerama is a top-view vertical shooter where the screens scrolls upwards constantly as you control a spacecraft whose mission is to save Earth from a large invading force over various levels. You have to fly low over various alien space cruisers so you can fly beneath their force fields and destroy as many solar panels as possible. As you fly you will encounter many alien ships trying to stop you and if you hit one or are shot then you lose one of five lives. Occasionally flashing squares appear and when flown over give you either extra speed, lives or bullets. When you reach the end of the level you will encounter a Mothership which needs destroying to move on to the next space cruiser.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "David Crummack", "publishers": "Hewson Consultants", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/111857-powerama\n"}
