{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tran", "overview": "A game by Steve Collins of Herobotix and Badlands fame. The unreleased game is based around a sideways space scroller in the mold of Defender, Uridium, Parallax and R-type, with the usual arsenal of weapon upgrades. The aim is to simply blast enemy crafts and collect orbs. When enough are collected, you are able to land and take control of the man on terrain, blasting enemies and saving hostages whom are imprisoned by blowing doors up with bombs. Once all the hostages are saved, its time to find your ship and blast off. When fully specced, you have 6 orbiting droid orbs, each with a lazer cannon. You can have forward and rear double cannons and also sid strafing bazookas.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Steven Collins", "publishers": "GO64!", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNDa7Fx5eZE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/150641-tran\n"}
