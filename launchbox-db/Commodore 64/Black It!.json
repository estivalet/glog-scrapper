{"altername_name": [], "name": "Black It!", "overview": "The aim of BLACK IT! is to discolor all the stones on the playing field so that in the end none are left. The stones can have different colors, which - as can be seen on the right edge of the picture - have different priorities. If the ball is now moved over a stone, it will be discolored according to the above-mentioned pattern and finally disappear completely. When all the stones are discolored, all you have to do is direct the ball onto a black field and you are in the next level. If you enter a black field and there are still stones left, you lose one of your five lives. In addition, time is on the player's neck. If you have mastered all 50 levels or just earned enough points, you can immortalize yourself with a clean high score. The game is controlled by a joystick in port 2. All levels are solvable, even if this may seem a bit difficult at times. Good luck puzzling!
