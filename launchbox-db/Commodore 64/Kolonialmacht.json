{"altername_name": [], "name": "Kolonialmacht", "overview": "Kolonialmacht is a multiplayer-only strategy game set in the Africa of 1884. Over the course of a restricted amount of months, three colonial powers try to gain the military and economic lead. One of the most important aspects are mines and plantations which produce the four resources of the game: cacao, tobacco, diamonds and gold. Those can be either sold for money or traded against another of the four resources. After every round the market prices change so the key to success is to anticipate which resource to concentrate on. The military troops are used to proceed against the enemies, either directly against their units or by conquering their assets.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Martin W\u00f6lk", "publishers": "Ariolasoft", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/110440-kolonialmacht\n"}
