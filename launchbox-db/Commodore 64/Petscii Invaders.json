{"altername_name": [], "name": "Petscii Invaders", "overview": "In this new version of Space Invaders for the C64 published by Apulia Retrocomputing, while the gameplay is almost identical to the original Arcade hit, in that you need to not only survive by destroy the enemy waves as they move from side to side and slowly drop towards you. What makes this version different other than it being developed using Petscii based graphics, is the fact instead of using buildings to defend yourself from the alien firepower, in this you have a limited amount of shield use... Once that goes down to 0% and you get hit losing your lives, it's game over!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "March 19, 2022", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Guido Cauli", "publishers": "Apulia Retrocomputing", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYMDIjZNhMw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/160578-petscii-invaders\n"}
