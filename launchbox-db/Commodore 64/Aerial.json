{"altername_name": [], "name": "Aerial", "overview": "Aerial is part of a series of games by Japanese developer Inufuto, who builds a single game design and then ports it to a very wide variety of retro hardware. Aerial is a side-scrolling shooter, in which the player pilots a plane viewed from the side-scrolling left to right. The joystick is used to pitch the plane up or down, and fire button to fire. The objective is to avoid planes/rockets being launched at the player, and shoot down planes or ground targets when possible. Powerups will also appear that are used by flying over them.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2022", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Inufuto", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvdW-Qce9gE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/371714-aerial\n"}
