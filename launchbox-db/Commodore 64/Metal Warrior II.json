{"altername_name": ["Metal Warrior 2"], "name": "Metal Warrior II", "overview": "Following the events of the first Metal Warrior game, Ian's war-metal band Cyberpriest splits up after a bitter conflict. In the aftermath, Ian grows distant and unstable, and finally disappears - leaving a mysterious note. The player takes control of Joan, AKA Phantasm - Ian's former bandmate (and his love interest) - as she sets out to explore the town, find clues about Ian's whereabouts, and uncover a new mystery. The game plays much like its predecessor, being a side-scrolling action/adventure. Phantasm will have to deal with characters both friendly and hostile, whether with words or with weapons; she starts out wielding only her fists, but more armaments can be found, as well as a host of other useful items. New features include an experience system, which works somewhat like Castlevania's, and a password feature which lets you continue your game in case of a premature death.
