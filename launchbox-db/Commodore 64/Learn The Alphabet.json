{"altername_name": [], "name": "Learn The Alphabet", "overview": "Show Perry the Penguin which letters to load onto the trucks. Then it's off to build the alphabet city. Here come the trucks for another load of letters! And that means you have a job to do. Perry the Penguin needs your help finding the matching letters. Climb with him to the letter loft where you can search through the alphabet. Do you need a capital letter or a small letter? Which truck should it go on? Each time you fill the trucks, they drive to the construction site and build more of the alphabet city. Learn the Alphabet starts with letter recognition games and then works up to simple spelling challenges like filling in the missing letters. Most important of all, Learn the Alphabet makes it fun for your child to learn about the alphabet and to look forward to reading. Learning Value: Learning to read first requires the development of certain skills. Learn the Alphabet helps develop an understanding of upper and lower case letters, as well as letter and word recognition.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Spinnaker Software", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75934-learn-the-alphabet\n"}
