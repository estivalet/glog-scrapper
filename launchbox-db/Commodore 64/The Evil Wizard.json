{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Evil Wizard", "overview": "The Evil Wizard is a single-player text based role-playing game (not a text adventure) for the Commodore 64. It was developed by Jesper Lindstr\u00f6m and released into the public domain in 2001. A sequel called Evil Wizard II was released in 2012. However, that was a shoot em up. Note: The game's text has a lot of typos and grammar errors, probably due to English not being the coder's native language.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2001", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jesper Lindstr\u00f6m", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/367548-the-evil-wizard\n"}
