{"altername_name": [], "name": "Explorer", "overview": "After attempting to simulate orienteering with The Forest, Graham Relph takes things a step further by creating a game-world with no fewer than 4 billion locations. These are drawn in considerable detail, and view-able from 2 different modes, as you fly (viewed from above) or walk (viewed panoramic-ally). The task is to locate 9 objects, and you do this by flying close enough to one that a beacon is activated, to which will direct you to it. You must then find a patch of clean land to land on, and then get close by walking to it. Occasionally you will encounter robotic bugs to kill.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "The RamJam Corporation", "publishers": "Electric Dreams Software", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/99933-explorer\n"}
