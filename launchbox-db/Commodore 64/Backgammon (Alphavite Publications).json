{"altername_name": ["Pete's Backgammon"], "name": "Backgammon (Alphavite Publications)", "overview": "Released in Commodore Disk User 1990/10 and in Your Commodore 1991/05 (Tape #17). Backgammon is a board game in which the aim is to move all fifteen of your counters around the board, and then off, before your opponent. Backgammon is played on a board that consists of 24 narrow triangles that are called points. The triangles alternate in color and are grouped into four quadrants of six triangles each. There are four types of quadrants: the player's home board and outer board, and the opponent's home board and outer board. The intersection of these four quadrants, the middle of the board, is separated by a ridge called the bar. Each player's home board is positioned on the right quadrant closest to the player. The home boards are opposite each other, and so are the outer boards, which are located in the left quadrant. The player moves his checkers from the direction of the other player's home board in a horse-shoe like direction, moving counterclockwise. The triangles are numbered from 1-24 in most of the Backgammon boards, with the 24th point being the furthest point from the player, and with 1 being the right most triangle on the player's home court. The players must move their pieces from opposite sides of the board, so one player's 1st point is the other player's 24th point, one player's 2nd point is the other player's 23rd point, and so on.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Peter Weighill", "publishers": "Alphavite Publications", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/87794-backgammon-alphavite-publications\n"}
