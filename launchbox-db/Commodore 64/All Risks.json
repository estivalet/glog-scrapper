{"altername_name": [], "name": "All Risks", "overview": "An advergame of an insurance company, the main goal is to recover the stolen successful slogans of said company, Victoria-Vesta. For each game, one of them was cut into pieces and hidden in rooms in two houses. When you find all parts of the slogan, you must form the slogan in the second part of the game. Looking for the slogans can be dangerous, but with a non-life insurance policy of Victoria-Vesta you run less risk. You can buy some of these insurances with a part of the budget made available for this at the start of the game. The premium will then be deducted from this budget.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Cees Kramer", "publishers": "RadarSoft", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.81", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv4lTy6S6lc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/108444-all-risks\n"}
