{"altername_name": [], "name": "Firebird", "overview": "Released in a combo pack with Duell. As an aircraft pilot, you must fly the the next runway and land as quickly as possible. You must pick up the time bomb, start again and drop the bomb over the sea. In doing so, you need to avoid oncoming aircraft. However, unlike most games of this kind, the aircraft can not fire to destroy your enemies. You really have to dodge also and therefore you must not evade and maneuver.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Tronic Verlag GmbH", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/117553-firebird\n"}
