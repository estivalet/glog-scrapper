{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cursed be the City", "overview": "Cursed be the City is a Gothic-themed text adventure where you play a character called Ashar, and begin your adventure bound to a rack in a dark and damp dungeon. You must find a way to escape this horrid place of misery and fear before the torturer burns out your eyes! As you can tell, this adventure is very dark in places and is not suitable for young children. Once you escape the dungeon you will eventually learn of your preordained quest. The location descriptions are generally rich with detail and it soon feels like you're reading a book. A lot of the characters in this one do have strange names, though, which makes your quest a bit confusing at times. If you're a fan of horror novels, then this one may appeal to you.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Pegasus Software", "publishers": "Pegasus Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/95387-cursed-be-the-city\n"}
