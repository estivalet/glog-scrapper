{"altername_name": [], "name": "Disintegrator", "overview": "Disintegrator is an all machine language arcade game. The object is to protect your base from the invading enemy. For your defense, you have at your disposal eight underground silos from which you can launch bombs that will disintegrate the oncoming enemy. These bombs are activated by pressing the appropriate number key (1-8). The enemy comes in waves of 15. Once all 15 ships have been successfully shot down, the level is complete and the next wave begins to attack at an increased rate of speed. There are nine levels in all. Pressing the space bar will pause the game. Pressing the space bar a second time will restart the game. If the enemy successfully reaches your base, one of your \"lives\" is lost. After three hits, your base is destroyed.
