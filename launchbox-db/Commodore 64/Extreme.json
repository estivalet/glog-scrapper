{"altername_name": [], "name": "Extreme", "overview": "Your task in Extreme essentially involves wiping out alien pirates, across 3 distinct sections. This was essentially a spare-time pet project, so you would expect some of the most advanced graphics and special effects you'll ever see. The first level involves flying around in a ship shooting out aliens, with contact depleting your energy (and causing the screen border to flash). The second section involves travelling underwater, running into landmines to set off explosions to kill surrounding enemies. The final part sees you travelling through a building in a huge droid, taking out everything in your path. The game is quite short, and would take around 20 minutes to play through.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mark Greenshields", "publishers": "Digital Integration", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpTiPSVIEYk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/100004-extreme\n"}
