{"altername_name": ["Fantasmi"], "name": "Ghost Hunter II", "overview": "Here is a rather new and fun version of the now more-than-classic PacMan. The novelties, compared to the more classic versions are the following: first of all it is possible to play with two players at the same time in an exciting head-to-head, in which you try to steal points from each other to leave the adversary with the attention of the ghosts. During the game it is possible to take advantage of a last hope of salvation, when nearly dead you will disappear for a few fractions of a second by hitting the joystick button. This feature can only be used once per screen. It is also possible to recover some lives by going to collect some pieces of the head that appear near the cage of the ghosts for a limited time. There are 15 screen patterns that can be chosen before starting, or that can be selected randomly by the game from time to time.
