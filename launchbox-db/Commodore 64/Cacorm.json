In this game from Inufoto, your task as the wood-be hero, is to traverse around the screen while avoiding monsters to collect as many stars as possible to win the game. What makes this different other than just picking the stars up, is not only can your character use a trail around each collectable star with the more stars you collect in one go the higher your score, but the trail can also be used to block the monster making life a little bit easier for you!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "June 29, 2022", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Inufuto", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHcCFZI2fXM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/163284-cacorm\n"}
