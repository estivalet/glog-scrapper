{"altername_name": [], "name": "Skramble (Rabbit)", "overview": "A meteor comes at you. Down! Then a fireball. Pull away quickly! That space monster is forcing you down into the mountains. Pull up or you're done for! Wait. Here's another missile coming up. Vaporise it before is gets too close! Now you're running out of fuel. Unless you attack that fuel dump ahead to replenish supplies, you'll crash. The further you go the tougher it gets. There's just a chance you can reach the city of death. But unless you reach the other side you'll be as dead as your mission.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nigel Rowlan", "publishers": "Rabbit Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqBVDX3xy0M", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/108029-skramble-rabbit\n"}
