{"altername_name": [], "name": "Miner (COMPUTE! Publications)", "overview": "Miner is a game with some resemblance to Boulder Dash, but also has a unique spin on the genre. You start off at the top of the screen, underneath a building of some sorts. Your goal is to dig through the screen finding gold along the way. Unlike Boulder Dash however, boulders cannot crush you, but you can use them to trap enemies that actually can kill you. Collect as much gold as you can and return it to the building once there is enough gold in the building it's onto the next screen. Miner was developed by Gus Vakalis and published as a type-in listing in COMPUTE!'s Gazette 1991/07 which was an insert in the Compute Magazine.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gus Vakalis", "publishers": "COMPUTE!
