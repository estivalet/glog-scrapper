{"altername_name": [], "name": "Crag", "overview": "A Yahtzee variant published in Loadstar #085 with 3 dice and up to 4 players. You want to get a combination of dice that will give you the best score in one of the 13 categories on the scorecard. You get to roll three times and you only roll the dice you choose. In the end the objective is to get as high a point total as possible. Every category must be filled and you can only fill them in once. This is where strategy comes in. The special in this game is the Crag category, the dice must add up to 13 and two of them must be alike, so 6-6-1 would be a Crag. This game has some categories to make it fun for the whole family!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Barbara H.
