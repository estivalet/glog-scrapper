{"altername_name": [], "name": "Robo-City", "overview": "This would appear to be Pete Torrance\u2019s first adventure. Later on, he wrote Subsunk and Seabase Delta, which are quite a lot better. The plot involves robots ruling Earth and then kidnapping a countess. Most of the puzzles are fairly simple, and the game is rather short but you can see glimmers of the adventures to come.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Peter Torrance", "publishers": "Argus Press Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/116116-robo-city\n"}
