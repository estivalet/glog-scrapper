{"altername_name": [], "name": "Island!", "overview": "Published in the RUN 1988/08 (Issue #56) and also in the RUN Strategy Pack I. Build a powerful Caribbean island empire while inciting unrest and revolution in your opponent's land. The story goes that, on the orders of King George III, two aristocratic brothers left London in the spring of 1799 and set sail for the Leeward Islands in the West Indies. The king was determined to turn the newly appropriated islands of Key Antigtta and St. Christopher into profitable colonies, and the brothers, as governors, were given five years in which to do the job. They arrived in the West Indies in early January of the following year and, each assuming control over one island, set about the task at hand. To all accounts, those early years were lough, with famine, hurricanes and rebel uprisings constantly threatening disaster. Whether or not the governors met the king's expectations remains unclear, because records are fragmented. However, today the islands of Key Antigua and St. Christopher are thriving members of the British Commonwealth. Welcome to Islands, an educational strategy game that puts you in the shoes of one of the governors, charged with building your island into a viable economic and military entity. This may be accomplished through treachery against the other island or honest hard work in nourishing your resources. Though Islands is meant to be played by two, you can also enjoy striving for a high score alone,", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "John V.
