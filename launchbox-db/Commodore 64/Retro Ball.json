{"altername_name": ["Retro-Ball", "Hyper Ball"], "name": "Retro Ball", "overview": "Retro Ball is a 2-player only competitive air hockey game. Each player controls the respective paddle on their side, and can use it to push the puck around the air hockey table. A point is scored when the puck is placed in the opposing team's net. At the beginning of each game, there is a toss-up to see who goes first. This is repeated if the puck becomes stuck on the center-line. Each game is timed, with the goal to outscore the other player. Players can choose from a fast or slow puck, to change game speed.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Alick Dziabczenko", "publishers": "HesWare (Human Engineered Software)", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/115230-retro-ball\n"}
