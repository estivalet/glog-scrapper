{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tomb of Horror", "overview": "At the farthest corner of the earth, beyond the barren wasteland, lies the Tomb, abode of the hideously evil Demon King and the hordes of darkness. The Demon's greatest treasure is the Alchemy Stone, an artifact from the ancient world that transmutes matter itself. Your task is to retrieve the Alchemy Stone (along with all the treasure you can gather) from the nether regions and escape from the Tomb of Horror into die light of day. This is the third (and final) entry in my trilogy of 3-D games. It evolved out of Crypt of Fear (Feb. '88 Ahoy!), which in turn was inspired by Cult of Terror (Oct. '86 Ahoy!). I like to think I've outdone myself, but you will ultimately be the judge of that. Released as part of Ahoy! 1988/07 (Issue #55).", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Cleveland M.
