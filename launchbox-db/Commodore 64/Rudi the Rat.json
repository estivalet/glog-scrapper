{"altername_name": [], "name": "Rudi the Rat", "overview": "An arcade style collect-em-up created by Martin Ostermann & Christian H\u00fcbel and published in Input 64 1986/02. A maze game that will test your ability to react. Rudi the rat is being pursued by black cats that appear quickly. In order to stay strong, Rudi has to look for nutritious cheese. When its energy reaches 'zero point', it's all over! But Rudi can defend himself and with a well-aimed throw of the fully ripe tomatoes temporarily blinds the cats. Rudi is controlled either via keyboard or joystick: The fire (SHIFT) key is used to throw tomatoes around. Fire and direction keys together result in a targeted throw; Fire + up and the oncoming cat can't see through it anymore, which is shown by the cat's red coloration. Lots of food and catchup!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "February 3, 1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Christian H\u00fcbel", "publishers": "Verlag Heinz Heise GmbH", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQy84bH1FsA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/166488-rudi-the-rat\n"}
