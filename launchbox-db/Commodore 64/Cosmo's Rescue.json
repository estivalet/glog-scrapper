{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cosmo's Rescue", "overview": "Free Cosmo from the hazardous cavern of the yellow monster Grunk-Snort. While exploring the hazardous cavern of the yellow monster Grunk-Snort, you and your purple friend Cosmo have become separated, and he has been captured by the dreaded Grunk-Snort. You must guide your rescue ship through the cavern, pick up Cosmo, and make your way back home. You have only three chances to rescue Cosmo. If you touch a wall, bump into Grunk-Siloft, or run out of fuel, you will have to start all over again. Your ship awaits you on the landing platform at the upper left-hand corner of Grunk-Snort's cavern. Keep an eye on the fuel indicator. The landing platform also serves as a fuel station at which you may refuel if necessary. To make a safe landing on the platform, your ship must be moving very slowly with no side motion. If you make it back to the landing platform after picking up Cosmo, your heroism and skill will be rewarded with one point for each unit of fuel remaining. Control the ship with the joystick. Gravity will be pulling you down at all times. Pressing the fire button fires the main engines, which thrust upward. Left or right motion of the joystick fires the side thrusters. Apply thrust very cautiously. Controlling the ship can be ticklish, and you may have to play many times before you learn to do it perfectly.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Frank Mikulastik", "publishers": "CBS College Publishing", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/94089-cosmos-rescue\n"}
