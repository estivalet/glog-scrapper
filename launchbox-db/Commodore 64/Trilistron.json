{"altername_name": [], "name": "Trilistron", "overview": "A 3D shooter from CRL/QuelleSoft and released in Germany. Your original mission was to construct a station with new and unknown technology on spiral arm 8 36. Unexpectedly, the sensors detected an unknown power field inside the planet TrilistronNhGenthullen, an unknown fading, blue-green planet. As you begin to investigate you are attacked almost immediately, without warning or explanation by a Trilistron space armada. The central observation computer ignores the indications that you should withdraw as the sector's strategic value is too important to be neglected. Only you and your spare ships remain to fend off the furious attacks. Suddenly calm, you know what you need to do, as paralyzing silence reigns in the control room you suit up, ignore the monotonous alert klaxon and prepare for battle.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "CRL Group", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwXXAXacDxY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/123909-trilistron\n"}
