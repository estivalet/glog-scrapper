{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sheepoid", "overview": "Well done! The space goat has been defeated and you're back on earth again. But after the earth shook, the mutant camels have made a comeback. Oh dear! A mix of different game styles including a gridrunner style game, shoot the mutants and baddies and save the sheep and even a breakout style mini game. A spin off tribute to Jeff Minter's Laser Zone. Two micro sheep have been transported into the neon Vortex, where each one is full of psychedelic invaders. Your mission is to blast those invaders with your sheep, armed with laser beams (firing from their eyes) and clear each of the 24 vortexes. Watch out because if an invader captures you, your other sheep will engage a self-destruct mode and explode as well. Collect baby sheep (don't laser blaze them) for more points. Collecting sheep will also award you a sheep bomb. Unfortunately you are only allowed to use it once.
