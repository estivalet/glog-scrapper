{"altername_name": [], "name": "Operation Ironhawk", "overview": "Quite a nice and polished fighting game from 1987, featuring some ripped Rob Hubbard music for good measure. You can kick enemies, or shoot them with a gun or bazooka, or throw grenades at them. There doesn\u2019t seem to be too much to do apart from that and go between two floors at present. It is a nice show case of a game that had some potential.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ron Hubbard", "publishers": "", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/123190-operation-ironhawk\n"}
