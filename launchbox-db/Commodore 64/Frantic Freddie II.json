{"altername_name": [], "name": "Frantic Freddie II", "overview": "If you\u2019re looking for a game to test your reflexes and platforming skills to the limit, you\u2019ll probably want to check out Oziphantom\u2019s new homebrew release for the C64. Blending elements from titles such as Bagitman and Pac-man, Frantic Freddie II is an unofficial sequel to an arcade collect \u2019em released way back in 1983 by Commercial Data Systems. Much like the original, Freddie must grab pots of gold scattered from the game\u2019s 16 levels, all the while keeping an eye out for encroaching meanies. Using ladders to reach higher platforms is vital to success, but there\u2019s a catch: you can\u2019t simply walk through them. The fact that ladders present as much an obstacle as a means to reach other platforms adds considerable complexity to the proceedings, and the only option is to clamber to the top, then descend back down the other side. This makes navigating each level a genuine challenge, and you\u2019ll need to think on your feet if you want to avoid becoming the filling in a monster sandwich. This game is as tough as they come, and while it\u2019s certainly not for the faint of heart, it\u2019s still worth a look \u2013 the definitely-not-copyright-infringing SID renditions of Queen\u2019s Don\u2019t Stop me Now and Eric Clapton\u2019s Layla are a neat touch", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "April 27, 2019", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Daniel Hotop", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KURxjjMxdvA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/127482-frantic-freddie-ii\n"}
