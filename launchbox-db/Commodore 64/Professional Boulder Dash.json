Rocford aka Roc, the lovable hero of the game, must recover all the diamonds found in the Silicen mine. The collection of gems is very dangerous ass the mine, which has been abandoned for centuries, is subject to landslides produced by every slightest movement. The quarries of the mine are populated by strange forms of life: the prolific green amoebas and the frenetic butterflies. These beings with particular precautions can be transformed into precious diamonds. Amoebas must be surrounded by boulders to prevent their continuous development while butterflies crushed by boulders will expose a diamond for the taking. Beware of terrible and deadly electric quadropolises that, released from their cells, will chase and disintegrate you. The riches of this mine are at your disposal but it will not be easy to take possession of them.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Peter Liepa", "publishers": "Edizioni Societ\u00e0 SIPE", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.edicola8bit.com/riviste/super_game_2000/c64/preview/roc.webm", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/128623-professional-boulder-dash\n"}
