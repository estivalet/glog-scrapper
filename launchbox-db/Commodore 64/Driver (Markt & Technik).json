{"altername_name": ["Lonely Driver"], "name": "Driver (Markt & Technik)", "overview": "A racing game created by Christoph Gladenbeck and released in Happy Computer 1985/04. Take part in the \"driver\" car race on the Commodore 64 with floppy disk drive. Overtake all opponents and get the high score to celebrate victory. Drivr is a car race for one player who can prove his driving skills in three levels of difficulty. With the joystick \u2014 connected to port 2 \u2014 you choose the level of difficulty and after pressing the fire button the game starts. The Joystick functions are: joystick forward accelerates, joystick backwards brakes the vehicle and with joystick to the right or left you change lanes. It is important to cover the distance indicated by a gray bar next to the three-lane track as quickly as possible and avoid many opponents to leave behind. If this succeeds without losing one of the three cars, there is a special game. You can win a maximum of five special sprites, which of course also means more points. Difficulty level 1 provides a training mode to consider. From level 2, time, points and, if you did well, your placement in the Top Ten list is displayed, then use the joystick to enter a three-letter abbreviation and the new leader board will be saved to disk.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "April 1, 1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Christoph Gladenbeck", "publishers": "Markt & Technik", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/97691-driver-markt-technik\n"}
