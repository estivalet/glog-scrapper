{"altername_name": [], "name": "Super Sprint", "overview": "Super Sprint is a racing game for one or two players, with the Arcade version allowing three players to race at the same time. Gameplay is from an overhead view of the racetrack. The racetracks start simple and gradually get more complicated, and may also feature obstacles ranging from traffic cones to tornadoes. Occasionally wrenches will appear in the roadway, and when collected they can be used after a race to power up your car with better tires, better acceleration or a higher top speed.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Catalyst Coders", "publishers": "Electric Dreams Software", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Sprint", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk2IpEzy3pA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109980-super-sprint\n"}
