A table editor is also provided \u2014 this allows you to choose a shape for the table and arrange the component parts as you wish. Up to four players can take it in turns, each with five balls in turn. Unusually, the default table has multiple flippers at the bottom of the table, as well as some located higher up. Use them to return a ball higher on table and to prevent it being lost at the bottom of the table. Hitting some valuable areas of the table gives you a bonus. Gain as many points as possible to rack up a high score.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "ERE Informatique", "publishers": "Gepo-Soft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macadam_Bumper", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQkVhRJppLE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/110486-macadam-bumper\n"}
