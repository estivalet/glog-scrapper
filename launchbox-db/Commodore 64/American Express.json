{"altername_name": [], "name": "American Express", "overview": "Across the United States of America, on a Harley Davison - who of us has never dreamed of it in a quiet hour? ! We offer you this dream, \"only\" for 64 heights, but at least! Travel from Seattle to Portland on screen and experience one of the most interesting and exciting action games that has ever appeared on MAGIC DISK! AMERICAN EXPRESS doesn't need much guidance. Before you start, you have the opportunity to buy all sorts of useful items for the journey from the menu. The motorcycle is controlled as usual via the joystick and is not a big problem. However, you should avoid any kind of collision with other vehicles, mines, etc. In the event that you want to take a coke break or the brown-eyed beauty from the neighboring house calls you surprisingly, simply put the stop to the hustle and bustle on the screen: The break function is activated by pressing the RUN / STOP.
