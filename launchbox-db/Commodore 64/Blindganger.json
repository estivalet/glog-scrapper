{"altername_name": [], "name": "Blindganger", "overview": "In Blindganger you play a blind person who is stuck in a sewer system. You have to find the exit by listening to the environment sounds. \"Ssshh\" stands for no obstacle, \"Kunk\" for sewer wall, \"Beep\" for deep well and \"Tink\" for the exit. Every couple of minutes, a wave flushes you through the sewer and you have to make your way back. When the time expires or you make it to the exit, an overview of the map is shown. Blindganger was published in the dutch magazine \"Commodore Dossier\" issue 17 in 1988. It was written in BASIC with some assembler routines.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Commodore Dossier", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/149344-blindganger\n"}
