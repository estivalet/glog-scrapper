{"altername_name": ["Tom & Jerry: Hunting High and Low"], "name": "Tom & Jerry", "overview": "The player takes the role of Jerry who has to navigate the five levels while collecting every piece of cheese. Besides the usual platforming obstacles there is a time limit and Tom who tries to catch Jerry. The player needs to avoid Tom but can also use the environment to get rid of him temporarily: a bowling ball on the head knocks him out or a prepared floor lets him slip. The main levels are side-scrolling, but between each level the game switches to a behind-the-shoulder perspective. Then Jerry has to run through a tunnel while collecting cheese and avoiding dynamite or bombs. If you like this game, Tom and Jerry 2 is very similar with new rooms to explore.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kevin Mikkelsen", "publishers": "Magic Bytes", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.3", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_%26_Jerry_(1989_video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Nb7cCF-0Fg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113938-tom-jerry\n"}
