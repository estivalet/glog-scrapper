{"altername_name": [], "name": "3D Tic Tac Toe", "overview": "3D tic-tac-toe is an abstract strategy board game, you play here against the computer. It is similar in concept to traditional tic-tac-toe but is played in a cubical array of cells, 4x4x4. Players take turns placing their markers in blank cells in the array. The first player to achieve four of their own markers in a row wins. The winning row can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal on a single board as in regular tic-tac-toe, or vertically in a column, or a diagonal line through four boards.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Cees Kramer", "publishers": "Micro Application", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.71", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/107538-3d-tic-tac-toe\n"}
