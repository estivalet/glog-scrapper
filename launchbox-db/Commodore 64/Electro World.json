{"altername_name": [], "name": "Electro World", "overview": "A horizontally scrolling shooter where you try to collect all the electrical cords before your fuel runs out. Created by Jason J. Briggs and published as part of the \"Red Ribbon Game Pak\". The year, 2034, a time in which man was meant to be prospering. But this was not to be. The machines that for generations have served us so well have turned upon us. Much of the anger wich now boils between mankind and the electronics is fueled by RUC (Ruthless uncontrollable computer.) It was built in the year 2021 to be the central controlling unit for the cities of the world, but something went wrong, very wrong. It wasn't very long before RUC had raised an army of electronics. TVs, Light Bulbs, Radios and even humble headphones had become our enemies. Since then, fourteen years of war have past, leaving man almost extinct on his own planet. Now it's your turn to do battle. Equipped with your jet pack and a standard pulse laser, you must attempt to capture the electrical cords which carry the vital power to RUC. Keep fueld up, fight his army and don't touch any of the electronics.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jason J.
