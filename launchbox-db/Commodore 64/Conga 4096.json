It is a 4k game where you whip around a bullet trail to destroy the baddies, try to survive and rack up as much points as possible. You aren't shooting the bullets, they follow behind you like the tail of a kite. Watch out for the plusses, they may be invulnerable.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2018", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Paul Koller", "publishers": "Reset64 Magazine", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvfEzNKEj1Q", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164966-conga-4096\n"}
