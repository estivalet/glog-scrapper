{"altername_name": [], "name": "Learn to Spell", "overview": "LEARN TO SPELL: Explore the ocean for the missing sunken letters. Reach the ocean floor and beat your highest score! You are the dolphin-one of the fastest swimmers in the sea. And you have a special mission: find the missing letters to complete each word on the submarine and help it reach the ocean floor. How far can you get before the submarine runs out of air? It won't be easy! As you go deeper, the words become harder. Some are short, and some are long. Some are magic words that can speed you along. And you'd better hurry or don't you know, the air will run out and back to the surface you'll go! If you're a good swimmer and a good speller, maybe-just maybe- you'll be the smartest dolphin in all the seven seas. Learning Value: LEARN TO SPELL focuses on how letters and letter combinations are used in spelling. The words have been carefully chosen to help children recognize common spelling pat- terns and rules.
