A platform based shooter published in New Special Playgames N\u00b009 (Maggio 1988) supplement: Games Commodore 64 N\u00b01. Let's enter the world of ships and pirate raids with this game that sees you as a protagonist in the role of Alberto. His task is to rescue his girlfriend who has been imprisoned in one of the cabins on the vessel of the cruel pirate Black John. Monsters, witches, cannonballs and goblins will hinder your mission. Here are some tricks that will be very useful in the game: on the stern ladder and on the cords of the trees: avoid any hostile figure and defend yourself by shooting, so your hands are busy to keep you clinging to the ladder you can only shot to the right. On the deck go down the stairs by tilting the joystick 45 degrees downwards/right. After passing the two masts of the ship you'll be able to go below deck using the ladder. You can enter the various rooms there by placing Alberto in front of the door. He will turn towards the door, now you hit the button to enter. Hidden below is a magical terminal of the future that once touched will inform you if you have completed the search in all the cabins, if so it will bestow a key. This key will open the door of the cabin where your beloved is held.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Alberto Geneletti", "publishers": "Edizioni Societ\u00e0 SIPE", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpX3KUgcxs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/124108-pirati\n"}
