{"altername_name": [], "name": "Castle", "overview": "In this platformer your aim is to find all 13 bottles that contain ingredients to a magic spice. You control a mechanoid and you will explore over a one hundred of locations of a castle. The castle is divided on three sections: outside, inside and underground (dungeons). At once you may carry up to three items. Apart from the above mentioned bottles that you have to bring back to one of the four buyers places, you may find potions of health restoring and keys to open locked doors. Some location can be accessible only using teleporters. At the bottom of the screen you can see the energy bar and your ingame progress represented by number of the bottles you still have to collect.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Krzysztof Augustyn", "publishers": "L.K.
