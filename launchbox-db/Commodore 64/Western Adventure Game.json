{"altername_name": [], "name": "Western Adventure Game", "overview": "After robbing the bank, your rough, tough and ready desperado colleagues have fled into the scrubland, dropping their guns and the loot. Well we all know that a man, or a Calamity Jane, has got to do what ever it is. So, you are on your own outside the bank and you have to make it to the horses, which some idiot left on the outskirts of town. On the way you can collect money and guns with bullets and then decide, if you run into the Sheriff's posse, whether to bribe or blast your way to freedom. Obviously your aim is to reach the horses with some bullets and some money. We are not advocating here that crime pays \u2014 that is up to you. Use the ARROW keys to make your moves. Your footsteps will appear on the screen as you move toward the horse in the top left hand corner of the screen. Your progress will be recorded on the bottom of the screen, and you will, in your progress, be told that you have run into the posse, and you will then be asked if you intend to shoot or bribe your way out. Key in SHOOT or BRIBE Should you run out of bullets I'm afraid that a lynching is your fate, as the posse were playing poker when you robbed the bank, and the Sheriff had a Royal Flush. If you reach your horse, you will hear the galloping as you ride off into the sunset.
