{"altername_name": ["Laser Target Firing"], "name": "G-Force", "overview": "Quick reflexes and good aim are the main qualities that you must have to play this nice shooting game well. The scenario is made up of various non-communicating lanes from which the targets will arrive from time to time. By means of your laser cannon you will have to move very quickly to the entrance of each lane and disintegrate everything that is coming at you. F7 will activate a superlaser that will destroy all the enemies on the screen, but only for a limited amount of times. Thirty-two different screens and a laser bonus every 30,000 points. Released in Italy as Laser Target Firing in Peek n.9 (settembre 1985).", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Arcadia", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.edicola8bit.com/riviste/peek/c64/preview/laser_target_firing.webm", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/102137-g-force\n"}
