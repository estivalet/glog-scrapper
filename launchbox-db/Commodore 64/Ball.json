{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ball", "overview": "The aim of this game is to steer a ball against the generic wall and fend it off if necessary. Sounds like the umpteenth variant of Breakout, but it is not. In order not to let the player fall asleep, the program has a few nasty tricks in store. Another ball floats vertically up and down in the middle of the screen. If the cue ball touches the said ball, our peaceful cue ball becomes a mean contemporary whose sole aim is apparently to send the player onto the boards. Among other things, life can be deducted if the player's ball leaves the field, penalty points can be distributed, etc. If the counter above the score display shows 3, the game is over (mostly for the player...) The only chance is to be faster and more skillful than the computer in order to stay afloat. With a little practice, you too can outsmart the computer. A tip at the end: By pressing the fire button, the club can be moved faster - often very helpful for reaching the ball.
