While your master hobbles around his courtyard in a mindless trance, demonic minions of the rival scream overhead, waiting for a chance to snatch your master and send him on a one-way trip to their summoner's lair. You, the lowly apprentice, with a few tricks from your studies, are all that stand between your master and his tortuous death. The game was initially released as part of COMPUTE!'s Gazette 1994/06.
