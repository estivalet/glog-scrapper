{"altername_name": ["Solid One"], "name": "Solid I", "overview": "A pretty nice vertically scrolling space shooter published in Magic Disk 64 1988/07, and also in Stonysoft #0404. 'Solid I' is a space game with a lot of action, good sound, and above all great graphics that can easily keep up with the graphics of commercially available software! There you will find a lot of enemy spaceships and UFOs who want to make life difficult for you. A total of three spaceships are available to you to complete your mission. Good luck and happy shooting! The game was developed by Thomas Koncina & Thorsten Koytka using Chris Yates' Shoot 'em Up Construction Kit.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Chris Yates", "publishers": "CP Verlag", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ene7RxWVkWY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/128452-solid-i\n"}
