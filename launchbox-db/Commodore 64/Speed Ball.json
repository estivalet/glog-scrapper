In a small arena with molybdenum walls, two players with nerves of steel will have to volley with a titanium sphere at constant acceleration using to gravito-magnetic repulsors that will be able to move in a limited area of the playing field. The aim being not only to protect one's own goal, but to score the greatest number of goals on your opponent. Since the sphere will move faster and faster and with sometimes unpredictable direction, be very careful not to score on your own self!
