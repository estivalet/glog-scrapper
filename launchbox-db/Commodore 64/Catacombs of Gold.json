{"altername_name": [], "name": "Catacombs of Gold", "overview": "Catacombs of Gold is a single player fantasy role-play video game. Journey into the dark and dangerous world beneath the castle fo Count Damion. But take some advice to make your journey a little safer and perhaps a little more profitable. You'll begin this journey with three hearts, 100 units of speed, strength and morale. If any of these four drop to zero you will remain in the catacombs forever. All you take with you is an old and unreliable magic ring. It was given to you by the only mane to ever enter the catacombs and return safely to the outside world. He warned you about the snakes and bats, that won't hurt you, but they do steal weapons and supplies. other monsters like the undead are under the Vampire's control and will try to hurt you, if you give them a chance. Other chambers will fill with deadly gas, you can try to outrun it or try to use the ring. The ring will also create a trapdoor to the next level which you can use to descend even deeper. Be sure to have something to make a map with, because you'll need it!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Fantavision", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ru-s6TQo3LE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90374-catacombs-of-gold\n"}
