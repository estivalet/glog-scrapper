{"altername_name": [], "name": "Donkey Kong", "overview": "This is the Ocean version of Donkey Kong which is different than the Atarisoft version on the C64. It must keep the \"Donkey Kong (Ocean)\" name to stay separate from the \"Donkey Kong (Atarisoft)\" listing in LaunchBox. In Donkey Kong, Jumpman must rescue a damsel in distress, Lady, from a giant ape named Donkey Kong. The hero and ape later became two of Nintendo's most popular characters. The game is divided into four different one-screen stages. Each represents 25 meters of the structure Donkey Kong has climbed, one stage being 25 meters higher than the previous. The final screen occurs at 100 m.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "July 1, 1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Arcana Software", "publishers": "Ocean Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.86", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHVLIyNQ-t8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6610-donkey-kong\n"}
