{"altername_name": ["Mr. Mephisto"], "name": "Mr Mephisto", "overview": "Once dead, most people can look forward to going to heaven but getting there is a tough ask, especially when Mr Mephisto is determined to stop people by sending out his minions to stop anyone attempting the journey. You play one person trying to make it up to heaven by attempting to complete various levels with each one shown on one screen viewed from above at an elevated angle. You must climb up various downwards moving staircases trying not to fall off and avoiding minions as they move down the stairs. At the top of the stairs are various exits and items to collect and these items have to be picked up to open the exits. If you do fall off or touch a minion then you lose one of three lives and sent back to level one.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dave Lucas", "publishers": "Euro-Byte", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Mephisto", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm7nHQSZG5M", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/110630-mr-mephisto\n"}
