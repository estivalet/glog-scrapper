{"altername_name": [], "name": "Chute Pursuit", "overview": "An updated version of Frexel with similar setup: Guide your ship through many deadly levels, shooting aliens and collecting flashing pods for greater firepower and jump energy. Shoot all laser locks to open the doorway to the next level. This cute game is set in the future where a plane has to cross a very strange region: Frexel-Kejland. The region in question has the particularity that each zone needs to destroy all the locks (recognizable, because they are key shaped) that are on the way to continue. Until all the locks are deactivated, you cannot go to the next level. The difficulties lie in the fact that there are many obstacles to break down in order to continue. There are even many active cannon positions that will shoot at you non stop. Sometimes the road is so thoroughly blocked that you must resort to specially created trampolines that allow you to jump over the barriers if they cannot be destroyed. Bonus disks, when found can give you more strength or more hits. This game had an early preview release but the full version, now available on the internet was never published by Ocean for reasons that are unclear.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ian Bean", "publishers": "Ocean Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90671-chute-pursuit\n"}
