{"altername_name": [], "name": "Orsital", "overview": "A platformer game created by George Allan and published in both Commodore Disk User 1989/11, and in Your Commodore 1990/11 (Tape #10). Collect the numbers in this unusual arcade style adventure. You are trapped inside a base on an abstract world known as 'Orsital'. Your objective is to escape this unfriendly environment. You start at the base exit (that seems logical) which must be unlocked by collecting the numbers I to 9. These numbers are scattered about the base in no particular order. Once you have collected all nine numbers, you make your way back to the exit which will now be opened, thus enabling you to escape to the outside world. This is no easy feat, because the numbers must be collected in ascending order. It is advisable to search out and locate just where the numbers are before you start collecting them.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "George Allan", "publishers": "Argus Specialist Publications", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/160591-orsital\n"}
