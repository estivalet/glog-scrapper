{"altername_name": [], "name": "Evacu-Pod", "overview": "A game where you pilot your Evacu-Pod to rescue miners on 4 other worlds. It was created by William K. Balthrop and published in Home Computer Magazine Vol.5, No.2. The call is out! Send Evacu-Pod! The time: in the near to distant future. The place: a neighboring planet. Mining operations have proven profitable\u2014but risky. Interplanetary construction crews have built full-scale communities on 4 planets, each with its own hospital serviced by crack rescue units. This is where you come in. You've trained back home to fly Evacu-Pod missions, but nothing on the relatively gentle Earth has prepared you for the varying rugged terrain that surrounds each medical center. Evacu-Pod pilots have rated the terrains for their hazards. You may volunteer to fly at any level: beginner, advanced, expert, or professional. Once you've selected a planet, you will be able to select a time period for your mission. Your choices range from the year 1995 to 2485. As the space program develops over the cen- turies, more efficient rockets and rocket fuels are invented; thus, the later the year, the easier the assignment will be. This efficiency is incor- porated into your rescue vehicle. In 1995, the rockets are fairly inefficient, and so require more fuel to lift the same amount of weight as a rocket built in 2485. On another planet, in another time, you delicately guide your ship on a hazardous rescue mission. Will you make it on time? Will you make it at all ?", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "William K.
