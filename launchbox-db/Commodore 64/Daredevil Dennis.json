{"altername_name": ["Dare Devil Dennis: The Sequel"], "name": "Daredevil Dennis", "overview": "Daredevil Dennis (spelled on screen Dare Devil Denis: The Sequel) is a computer games published by Visions Software in 1984 for the Acorn Electron and BBC Micro. Daredevil Dennis: The Sequel was published by Visions Software for the Commodore 64, but was still simply called Daredevil Dennis on the cover. Daredevil Dennis is a platform game of sorts where the player takes the role of Daredevil Dennis, a stuntman. Dennis must use a variety of vehicles (motorbike, jet-ski and ski-doo) to perform a number of stunts. The only controls are accelerate, brake and jump. The screen is split into four platforms. When the character leaves the end of one, he appears at the start of the next. Both the controls and screen layout are same as in Atari's 1977 Stunt Cycle arcade game. On most levels, gaps in the platform where the character can fall through and land on the platform below. There are many hazards scattered across the platforms that must be avoided. These range from static objects like trees and houses to moving objects such as jumping policemen and speeding ambulances. If Dennis hits any of these objects, he is flung from his vehicle as it bursts into flames and he must start again (with 'take 2'). If he crashes too many times, he is 'fired'. Points are given in the form of a wage. This is actually the second game, however, the original was not sold on the C64 (only on the BBC Micro), thus the boxart just has Daredevil Dennis on the cover.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Simon Pick", "publishers": "Visions Software Factory", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NElN_p2odt4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/91877-daredevil-dennis\n"}
