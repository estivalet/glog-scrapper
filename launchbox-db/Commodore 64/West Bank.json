{"altername_name": ["Bank Panic"], "name": "West Bank", "overview": "The game takes place at the time of the gold rush in the Wild West. You guard the money storage of the West Bank, into which a great number of customers put their money. The West Bank has 12 doors, and each of them needs to get one incoming payment per day. To aggravate this bandits try to rob the money from the bank. In the first days they are easy to defeat. Just draw the gun early enough. In the following days also gunslingers appear next to further bandits. Here, you are only allowed to shoot when the enemy draws his pistol. Some of the opponents simpy just put in money. The small man with the many hats brings money or a bomb to the bank. So pay attention well, because you will also lose one of your three lives if you shoot innocent people. Between each new day there is a duel against three bandits. Here you are only allowed to shoot when the corresponding opponent draws. The faster the better. Beware, you can also get shot or lose a life here, if you shoot too early.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dinamic Software", "publishers": "Gremlin Graphics Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is5KnA-EcTs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/82881-west-bank\n"}
