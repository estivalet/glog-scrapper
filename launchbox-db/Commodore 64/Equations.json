{"altername_name": [], "name": "Equations", "overview": "A one or two-player board game published in Loadstar #117. Now that you've memorized the Official Scrabble Player's Dictionary, here comes a version of the game that uses mathematical equations instead of words. If you want to play solo, simply RETURN for the second player's name. A solo game is played for points; not against the computer. If two people are playing you take turns making plays, just like in Scrabble. Hit the H key if you need help. Equations uses a 19x19 board with some squares giving a bonus score. DN doubles the number on the square, TN triples and DE means double all the numbers in the equation and TE means triple all the numbers in the equation. The first play must cross the center square. Each player is dealt 10 tiles, 6 number tiles and 4 operators (+, -, *, / and =) with a total of 180 tiles in a game. When all have been played, the game ends. Use your turn to create a legal equation with all operators on the left, none to the right of the equals sign. All equations are evaluated from left to right. With the exception of the first play, all equations MUST use at least one of the tiles already on the board.
