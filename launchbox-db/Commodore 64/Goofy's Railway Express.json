{"altername_name": [], "name": "Goofy's Railway Express", "overview": "In Goofy's Railway Express, Goofy and Mickey are railroad conductors helping children with colors and shapes. This is done by a series of screens for young children to start visually identifying shapes and color matching while the train crosses colorful landscapes. When the train smoke stack produces colored shapes, such as a square, circle, or triangle, the child must press the spacebar key. If the shape and color matches the shape and color above a Disney character waiting on the train platform, then the train will stop and pick up that passenger. Otherwise an unique animation appears somewhere on the screen for entertainment.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Westwood Associates", "publishers": "Walt Disney Computer Software", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/102618-goofys-railway-express\n"}
