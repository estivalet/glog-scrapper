{"altername_name": [], "name": "Fickle", "overview": "Released as part of the RGCD C64 16KB Cartridge Game Development Competition 2014. A one-button real-time puzzle game for the Commodore 64 that was originally released for the unexpanded VIC-20 and was later updated for the C64 in 2014. Watch out for the rotors, but remember they can in some cases be used to your advantage. Clockwise rotors will twist Fickle to the right and anticlockwise rotors will twist Fickle to the left. Remember that the timer gives you a lot more time than it will take for Fickle to reach the heart, so I recommend you try to plan a route through the level before you start.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2014", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Malcolm Tyrrell", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/100591-fickle\n"}
