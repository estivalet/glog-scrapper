{"altername_name": ["Fantabit"], "name": "Bit Exorcist", "overview": "The ghosts have left their mansions in the old estates and have moved into the printed circuit boards of your computer. You must find them and destroy them, as well as repair the chips that have been damaged. Every level has more ghosts and is more complex. You pilot a small vehicle that is on the circuits which has been fitted with an anti-ectoplasm bean for use on the specters and can see broken circuits on the radar trace. Damaged chips can be repaired by using the arrow keys to allow the signal to pass correctly. More info on this is given in the memo at the start of the game.
