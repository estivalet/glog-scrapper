{"altername_name": ["Galeoni"], "name": "Brig Battle", "overview": "A sea-battle dueling game requiring 2 players where the object of the game is to sink your opponent's ship. Each ship has one cannon that can fire in all directions except from the bow or stern of the ship. The wind speed and direction change regularly. The ships will start off in an easy battle that gets progressively harder. Battles are worth 250*damage points remaining. Remember that ships will not go directly upwind, but will go faster downwind. It takes some time to reload. Lastly, beware the unfriendly fort. Game was released in Italy under the names Vascelli and Galeoni and was released in North America by BCI Software in the 3 for All game compilation.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "General Masters", "publishers": "Arcadia", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1oK6TYgcqs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90093-brig-battle\n"}
