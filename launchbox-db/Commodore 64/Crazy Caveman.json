Crazy Caveman is a side view scrolling game where the screen scrolls from right to left when you move your caveman as you avoid boulders and other creatures on your way home. You will first encounter boulders rolling towards you and they must be jumped over before facing dinosaurs running towards you and you must use your axe to get rid of them. Dodo's are next and they bounce along the screen and you must avoid them before facing birds flying overhead dropping rocks. If you are hit by any object or creature then you lose one of three lives.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "January 1, 1983", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Jason Perkins", "publishers": "Merlin Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.58", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIq29DuahW4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/32328-crazy-caveman\n"}
