Now, this is your once-in-a-lifetime chance to become apprenticed to a sorcerer. Unfortunately, the sorcerer has whisked himself away on holiday leaving your in change of the practice. At first, all goes well but then the mischievous brooms decide to flood your reservoir. With the aid of your magic wand, you must nudge the brooms into dropping the water, but take care if you fail, the brooms will multiply. Ultimately, you must go to the sorcerer's castle to find the appropriate spell to halt the brooms in their tracks. While you're there, take some time off to play with a whole variety of spells. Who knows, if you become a frog, a princess might appear and turn you into a prince; on the other hand, she might not!
