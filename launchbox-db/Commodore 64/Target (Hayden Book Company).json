{"altername_name": [], "name": "Target (Hayden Book Company)", "overview": "Try to make the ball hit the round target in the centre. Kind of like as very basic implementation of pinball in a way, only with one target for the ball to hit. Also you cannot hit the squares in the corner. Hitting the squares results in a game over. Developed by Peter Holmes & Derek J. Bush of Honeyfold Software and published by Hayden Book Company in the book Commodore 64 BASIC Programming in 1984. While the game was a type-in, the book was also released with a floppy disk containing all the programs in the magazine already typed-in and up and running.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Honeyfold Software", "publishers": "Hayden Book Company", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/155422-target-hayden-book-company\n"}
