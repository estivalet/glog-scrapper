{"altername_name": [], "name": "Deep Void", "overview": "An English and German language brain game created by Assassin and Willow with music by Toni Hilpinen & Ringo Reuter. Released to the public domain in 1997. The aim of the game is to guess five letter words. After the game starts you'll see the first letter on the upper left cell. Now you should complete the word by filling in the other cells. Just like mastermind, letters who are in the searched word turn cyan. If a letter is also at the correct place, it will stay there for following rows. For every incorrect attempt, you get less points in the end. Additionally, for every turn you have just 15 seconds. If you can't get it in five tries you will lose one of your two lives and the yin\\yang symbols on the upper screen will shrink.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1997", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Assassin", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164981-deep-void\n"}
