{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Camp: Caravan Edition", "overview": "In the Year 2015, \"The Camp\" was released in the Forum64 Adventure adventure game compo - however only in German. The Camp - Caravan Edition is an improved and translated version of the game, with revised graphics, more riddles to solve and - highly important - more peppermint tea. The Camp is an adventure satire that was made with the D42 adventure editor that is also available from our shop. It bases on a real life youth camp, so similarities to existing persons or places are not totally coincidental. Protovision was involved in the making of this new enhanced version of this adventure by TUGCS and presents the Camp now in a limited box edition including a survival kit for all kinds of camping situations: Next to the disk and the camp magazine there is a custom made beer coaster, charcoal, peppermint tea and - while stocks last (and that is a problem as you will know if you have ever been to a youth camp) - toilet paper.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2016", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sebastian Bega\u00dfe", "publishers": "Protovision", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "0.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/116398-the-camp-caravan-edition\n"}
