Your goal is to eat all of the bits of bread in order to score points and move to the next maze. Wandering throughout the maze are many skeletons who are trying to catch you. Your knight has the ability to temporarily turn into a ghost and be able to pass the skeletons. To do so you will need to pick up the potions located throughout the maze. The maze also contains numerous doors. The knight can move these doors to reconfigure the maze and outsmart the bones brigade coming after you. Each level also has bonus items for points, each bonus gotten without dying add a streak bonus. Fire to turn into a ghost.
