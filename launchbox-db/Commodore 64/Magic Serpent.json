{"altername_name": [], "name": "Magic Serpent", "overview": "Magic Serpent is a Snake variant. The player controls a snake called Lenni who has to eat all fruits which are divided over the scrolling level. Said levels are constructed like mazes, i.e. many small gangways. Every time a fruit is eaten, the length of Lenni grows. The player needs to control Lenni (he moves and turns automatically when meeting a wall; the player only needs to intervene when another turn is in order) in a way so he does get in his own way. Each level has to be completed within 60 seconds, but collecting clocks extends this limit. Other power-ups are rabbits (make Lenni faster) , snails (make Lenni slower, but no slower than the default speed), axes (the length of Lenni gets cut back to the starting value) and teleports to the starting point of the level. Each power-up also effects the points.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mathias Reichert", "publishers": "Software 2000", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iR7xC05-TDA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/114257-magic-serpent\n"}
