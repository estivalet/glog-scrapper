{"altername_name": ["Advanced Basketball Simulator"], "name": "Slam-Dunk", "overview": "Slam-Dunk is a two on two basketball game. Play against the computer or against another player. The game is divided into 4 quarters of three minutes each. The team with the highest score at the end of the final quarter wins. An overtime session can occur if the game ends in a tie. The game provides a practice session. Here you can learn the moves and plays needed to beat your opponent. You control one of your players on your team. Your teammate will be controlled by the computer, based on your movements of the controllable player. On offense, you control the man with the ball. On defense, you control the man guarding the ball. On defense, you can switch your controllable player by moving the joystick right while pressing the button. In this fast paced game, fouling can occur if defense plays too close or offense shoves its way into a defensive man. After five fouls, free throws will be shot. If you're shooting free throws, simply hit the button to take the shot. Made free throws count as one point. Keep an eye on the shot clock. Don't get caught holding the ball. Remember that any shot taken and made outside the three-point line is worth three points.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sculptured Software", "publishers": "Mastertronic", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u55A1PEWvE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/87710-slam-dunk\n"}
