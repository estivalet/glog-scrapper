{"altername_name": ["Supremacy: Your Will Be Done", "Supremacy"], "name": "Overlord (Virgin Mastertronic)", "overview": "The goal of Overlord/Supremacy is to create and protect a network of planetary colonies and defeat a computer adversary who is trying to do the same. There are four skill levels, each represented by an enemy race, and each featuring a progressively stronger opponent. The more advanced a system is, the more freedom a player has when purchasing spacecraft. Higher skill levels also result in different numbers of planets in each system.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "January 1, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Probe Software", "publishers": "Melbourne House", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supremacy:_Your_Will_Be_Done", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rln4K1NdJdo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/29877-overlord-virgin-mastertronic\n"}
