{"altername_name": [], "name": "Disaster Flight", "overview": "A single player flight simulator game from Tim Hartnell & Brett Hale and published in 1984 in the book, \"The Big Fat Book of Commodore 64 Games\". Here's your chance to fly a plane, with a complex and fairly realistic flight simulator program. Russia has planted a nuclear device somewhere in_ the United States. The. president has called an emergency meeting with the country's top five nuclear physicists. You are the president's private pilot, and you've been assigned to find, pick up and deliver the five scientists to New York, where the president is waiting. However, to do this you have to cover every inch of the country in order to find them. If you decide to fly below 1000 feet, then you run the risk of hitting a mountain. You are able to go around, or over a mountain, but if you take too long to decide what to do, you'll fly straight into it. As you fly around the country, you'll see the current State that you're over is shown in the top Left hand corner of the screen in purple. If you pass over a State which contains a scientist, then the name of the State will be shown in white. Each State is shown as one or more five by five squares. As some States are\u2019 Larger than others, you'll see these represented by two or more of the groups of squares. Set you elevator, plan your airspeed, hand on the throttle, check your compass, foot off the brakes, take off and get into the air!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Brett Hale", "publishers": "Interface Publications", "genres": "Flight Simulator", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/96528-disaster-flight\n"}
