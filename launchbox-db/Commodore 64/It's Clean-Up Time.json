{"altername_name": ["Clean Up Time"], "name": "It's Clean-Up Time", "overview": "Otto and Bobban, two cowboy cleaners have been hired by a new hotel to clean it before the staff and the first guests arrive. Vandals had broken in and littered the place with paper and it's up to our two heroes to clean the mess up. The game is a platform game with each of the eight levels shown on the screen as you attempt to clean each floor of the levels. Each floor is connected by stairs with various creatures moving about either by the stairs or poles on the edge of the screen. The creatures can either be shot or avoided as touching them loses one of three lives. A smart bomb can also be used but these are limited to three a level. As you sweep up the paper the vandals will occasionally place more paper and with each level having to be completed before a timer runs out, then the quicker a level is done the better. Also on each level is a bucket than can be collected for bonus points. One or two players can play and both players play on the screen at the same time.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Karl H\u00f6rnell", "publishers": "Players Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3AoS5xhtbQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90767-its-clean-up-time\n"}
