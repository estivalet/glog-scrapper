{"altername_name": ["Wizball"], "name": "Wiz Ball", "overview": "The theme of Wizball is unique. It is a horizontally-scrolling game, which involves navigating around a landscape and shooting at sprites. However, the aim of the game is to collect droplets of coloured paint to colour the level. Each level starts off as monochromatic, drawn in three shades of grey, and needs three colours to be collected to complete it. The player, a wizard who has taken the form of a green ball, has access to three levels at a time, and can navigate between them through portals. Each level has droplets of a different primary colour which may be collected. At the same time, each level needs a different colour to be added, which can be composed by collecting sufficient quantities of the correct primary colours. The C64 version of the game game was highly praised in Zzap!64 magazine getting a score of 96%, as well as 8/10 in Commodore User.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sensible Software", "publishers": "Erbe Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.37", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizball", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK82X9VlE38", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6124-wiz-ball\n"}
