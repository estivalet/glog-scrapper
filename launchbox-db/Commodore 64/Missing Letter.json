{"altername_name": [], "name": "Missing Letter", "overview": "An educational - vocabulary/language game for one or two players created by Vince Apps and released in 1984 in the book \"40 Educational Games for the Commodore 64\". If you are one of those poor souls who are always being told by someone that you miss letters in words don\u2019t worry too much because it\u2019s supposed to mean that you are clever and that your brain works faster than your hands. However, it\u2019s not a good idea to go on doing it so we have invented this game to help you. Words are going to appear on the screen and you are going to have to spot the missing letter. If your answer is correct the computer will tell you that your decision was correct, award you a number of points depending on the speed of your response and move on to the next word. Wrong answers will mean no points and the computer will move on to the other player - if there are two playing.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Vince Apps", "publishers": "Granada Publishing Ltd.", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/127976-missing-letter\n"}
