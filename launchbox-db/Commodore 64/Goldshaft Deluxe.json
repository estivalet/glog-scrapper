Most policemen are bribed. There seems to be no chance to get out of this nightmare. The big boss - Ugly Fat Joe - controls everything and everybody. There is only one man who could kick these bastards out of the city... Goldshaft! He's got his nickname for being tougher than shaft and for using huge amounts of \"Gold Taft\" harspray.
