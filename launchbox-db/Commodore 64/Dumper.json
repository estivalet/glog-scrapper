How can you stop the defense-wall being smashed? You must replace the bricks in the barricade as they are knocked out by the alien forces \u2014 but will you have time? Can you fill in the holes faster than new ones are made? Points are gained by filling in the holes \u2014 the deeper the hole, the greater the number of points you score. I moves your truck left, P moves it right and spacebar drops a brick. You have only 3 trucks left with which to defend your city \u2014 so good luck!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gregg Barnett", "publishers": "Melbourne House", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "0.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/97911-dumper\n"}
