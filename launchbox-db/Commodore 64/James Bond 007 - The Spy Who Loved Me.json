{"altername_name": ["The Spy Who Loved Me"], "name": "James Bond 007: The Spy Who Loved Me", "overview": "James Bond: The Spy Who Loved Me was Domark's penultimate Bond game, and is widely considered to be a rip-off of the arcade classic Spy Hunter. Both titles feature gadget laden cars in a vertical-scrolling racing and shooting game. The problem with The Spy Who Loved me is the bad controls, and the low production values. For instance, the boat sections have a little map to indicate where ramps and dead-ends are, but they are sometimes incorrect, causing frustrating deaths. On the plus side, the graphics and music are good on the Amiga and Commodore 64 versions.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "The Kremlin", "publishers": "Domark", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Spy_Who_Loved_Me_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4asJ-_6iqAg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/31781-james-bond-007-the-spy-who-loved-me\n"}
