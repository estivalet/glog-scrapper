{"altername_name": [], "name": "Destroyer (Type-In)", "overview": "Released in both 100 Programs for the Commodore 64 and Commodore User 1985/01 (Games Extra Book). You need to hit and take out the U-Boats, the submarines are at random depths. There are also random elements in their movement, so hitting them isn't as easy as it may look. The destroyers move faster than the subs, so that if you miss one you can catch it if it isn't too deep. If you give chase though, there is the danger of of being on the wrong side of the screen as a submarine escapes.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ian McLean", "publishers": "Prentice-Hall International (PHI)", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/96479-destroyer-type-in\n"}
