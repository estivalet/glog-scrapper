This SEUCK based shooter was released some time in the very early 90's by Champion Software. You must wend you way through the heavily defended fortress, destroying the guardian troops and bots before they get you. Will you be able to get your bounty? It will take a LOT of killing but.... this is the way.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Chris Yates", "publishers": "Champion Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOw73zZqygQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/146213-bounty-hunter-ii\n"}
