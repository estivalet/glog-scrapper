{"altername_name": ["Pingor"], "name": "Centron", "overview": "Head to head top to bottom Pong! A game much like tennis but with a metal ball intended to be played by two people, each with their own joysticks. The ball will be brought into play from the center of the court, suddenly arising from a large ball that appears to be similar to a planet. The direction of the ball will be random to begin. Good luck and happy gaming! This game was released in Italy under the name Pingor in both Hit Parade C64 n.71 (Ottobre 1992) and Special Program n.88 (giugno 1992).", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Blue Chip", "publishers": "Edizione Logica 2000", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/hZfM6tZGjY0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90457-centron\n"}
