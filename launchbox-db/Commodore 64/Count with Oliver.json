{"altername_name": ["Tellen met Jeroen"], "name": "Count with Oliver", "overview": "Count with Oliver is an educational program to introduce children aged four to seven to the basics of counting and simple addition and subtraction. It consists of two games: In Toyshop Oliver asks the young player to count the toys in a shop window. There are three sorts of toys (teddy bears, boats, and bikes) and in three colors (green, blue, and red). He will make requests and it requires numerical answers only. In Lollipops Oliver is at a shop and will ask the player about the different shapes of the lollipops and their colors. The player will learn addition when Oliver collects the different sorts of lollipops and subtraction when Oliver eats them. The player is required to enter the correct number using the number keys. Each time Oliver eats some lollipops he will swell up as the game progresses and this has serious consequences for his health. The answers to the sums require double digits when playing the game through for a second time in the same", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Marmalade Software", "publishers": "Mirrorsoft", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/121584-count-with-oliver\n"}
