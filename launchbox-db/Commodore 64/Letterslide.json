{"altername_name": [], "name": "Letterslide", "overview": "A single player puzzle\\brain game by Barbara H. Schulak & Fender Tucker and published in both Loadstar #140 and Loadstar #189. Have fun playing this word game that uses on-disk dictionaries. You're given a grid of 160 random letters in a 10x16 configuration with a red blank row in the middle. You are to create words on the red row by scrolling the columns up or down. When you think you have a word on the red row reading left to right press return to see if it is in the word list, if so you get one point or every letter in the word. If it is not in the list you get a buzzer!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Barbara H.
