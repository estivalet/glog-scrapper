This program requires special care to enter correctly; please see the section \"Typing in the Program\" The airborne forces of Richthofen, the dreaded Red Baron, have been mobilized. Because of your reputation as a swift pilot and accurate gunner, you have been chosen to defend the front line. Only a few planes are available, with no time to build more. Prepare yourself to meet the hordes of Richthofen. As you encounter each succeeding wave of the enemy, another airplane will be delivered to the front. Once all the planes have been destroyed, however, there will be nothing to stop the enemy from an all-out invasion. Your skills are all that stand between Richthofen's forces and your country", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Chris Metcalf", "publishers": "COMPUTE!
