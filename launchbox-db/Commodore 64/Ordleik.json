Features: * 3 modes of play. EasyZap: You can choose freely from any of the letters. WordZap: You can only choose letters adjacent to an open square. BagoZap: You can choose letters near the last one selected (also diagonally). * Dictionaries in 3 languages: English, Norwegian and German. * High score saving, each game mode has a top 50 high score list, including date of achievement.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2001", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ruben Spaans", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/132287-ordleik\n"}
