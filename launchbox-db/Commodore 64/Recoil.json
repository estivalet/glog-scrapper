{"altername_name": [], "name": "Recoil", "overview": "Recoil is a snake variant for the Commodore 64. It was developed by Jeffrey D. Panicki and published in ReRun Special Summer Edition 1990. RECOIL IS AN EGG-CITING arcade-style game for the C-64 that features multicolored graphics and fast action. The object is to direct the \"snake\" to the eggs he wants for lunch without letting him bump into obstacles or double back and touch himself. Recoil requires a joystick plugged into port 2. When the tide screen appears, press the fire button to draw the game screen and begin play. The snake first appears as a pair of eyes. When you push the joystick to launch him on his way, he grows forward in the direction you push. At high levels of play, when the snake must find a lot of eggs, his body gets very long and fills a lot of the screen, making it hard to avoid touching himself. There are as many eggs on the screen as the current level of play plus one. Each egg the snake eats is worth ten points times the current level of play. When he's eaten all the eggs, you advance to the next level of play. The snake must slither around numerous rocks in his quest for eggs, and there are more rocks at each level. If he bumps into a rock, he loses one of his four lives. He also loses a life if he hits the wall that surrounds the game screen, doubles back and touches himself or doesn't get all the eggs on the screen. The game ends when he's lost all of his lives. You can play again by pressing the fire button.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jeffrey D.
