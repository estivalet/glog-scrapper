This is an action game where you take your pulsating light ship and navigate the treacherous caverns either against a friend\\foe or against the computer. Every time you clip a rocky outcropping or stalagmite your shields are worn down just a bit, if you can keep clear it will regenerate but big hits will cost you. The craft more skillfully piloted will live and therefore win!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "January 6, 2003", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Marcus Hinzmann", "publishers": "GO64!", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75906-hyper\n"}
