{"altername_name": ["Space Invasion"], "name": "Commando", "overview": "You are Super Joe the cracked combat soldier of the eighties battling against all odds to defeat the advancing rebel forces. Equipped with only an M60 machine gun and six hand-grenades you carry out your lone crusade, forcing your way into hostile territory. Mortars, grenades and dynamite rain from the skies and explode around you. Enemy bullets fly past you in all directions, trenches, cliffs and lakes block your path. Rebel forces appear from caves, strong holds and troop carriers to stop your progress. You must show no mercy. You must not retreat. You must keep pushing yourself further and further into enemy lines, collecting supplies of hand-grenades from defeated outposts, until you reach your final objective, the fortress. Have you got the skill and stamina to defeat the enemy?", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Elite Systems", "publishers": "Data East USA", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.10", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commando_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDAhixO2t5w", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6149-commando\n"}
