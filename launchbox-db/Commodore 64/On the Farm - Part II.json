{"altername_name": [], "name": "On the Farm: Part II", "overview": "Meet Mondschaff the sheep and a load of his friends. This time round, the sheep isn't your player. In fact, it's completely different. You play Shep, a beloved border collie (sheep dog) who has a job, which is to guide the sheep back to their pen, where they belong in time for sheep shearing. Shep must herd a certain number of sheep in each of the 20 levels, within a certain time limit. If the time runs out and not enough sheep have been sent to their pen, you will have to restart the level. Otherwise you can simply enter the pen - to complete the level. To herd the sheep, shep must face the sheep and constantly follow and bark at them (Pressing fire will bark at the sheep). If Shep is too slow, the sheep will decide to move away from the pen. Your dog can also move the sheep up / down by colliding into it. You can also bark at the wolves that try and attack the sheep, but you will have to be fast at this job, otherwise Farmer Rich will be upset to lose his sheep - just like little Bo Peep :o)) !", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2011", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Achim Volkers", "publishers": "The New Dimension (TND)", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75997-on-the-farm-part-ii\n"}
