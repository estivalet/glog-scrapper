{"altername_name": [], "name": "Kye", "overview": "This is the C64 port of Colin Garbutt's puzzle game from 1992, Kye. The reason I made this port was primarily technical: I wanted to implement a game in 6502 assembly involving hundreds of active objects interacting with each other, and push graphical limits at the same time by augmenting hi-res graphics with a dynamic sprite overlay. Kye was the perfect candidate for this experiment, since it saved me the trouble of having to come up with my own design, and it's a mostly forgotten game with a lot of user-made levels that's definitely worth a bit of fresh attention. The goal of the game is simple: move around with the green circle thing and collect all the diamonds. It's up to you to discover the rules!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "December 7, 2022", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "", "developers": "cobbpg", "publishers": "", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/169121-kye\n"}
