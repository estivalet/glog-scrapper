{"altername_name": ["Revs Gold Edition"], "name": "Revs", "overview": "Revs can almost be thought of as a 'dry run' for Geoff Crammond's successful F1GP series. It's a simulation of Formula 3 racing cars, which many top Formula 1 drivers began in. Realistic physics are applied for perhaps the first time in a racing game. Brands Hatch and Silverstone are recreated in fairly minute detail. Graphics are similar in style to F1GP, but obviously much less sophisticated.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Geoffrey J.
