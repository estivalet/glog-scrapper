{"altername_name": ["Paper Planes 64"], "name": "Paper Planes", "overview": "Collect as many yellow tokens as possible while steering left and right to avoid the ever-increasing number of coloured enemy planes. Enemy planes follow the same path as you, with the exception that unlike you they cannot wrap around from one side of the screen to the other and will instead turn around. This means you can try different strategies to manipulate enemy movements or simply rely on quick reflexes to steer clear of trouble. This is a conversion of a casual game made by Sam Demaine for Ludum Dare. The C64 version was developed by Nick \"Arlasoft\" Sherman and released for free on his itch.io page on January 15, 2022.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "January 15, 2022", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Arlasoft", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtube.com/watch?v=qoIrGQIAj4c", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/158271-paper-planes\n"}
