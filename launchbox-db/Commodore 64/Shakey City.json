{"altername_name": [], "name": "Shakey City", "overview": "The player is caught up in an earthquake and must rescue all the other survivors and escape. The parser is simple and uses the standard verb-noun format, though only the first two letters of each word need be entered. All directions are in form \"go east\", etc. and the walkthrough assumes that the player has typed in \"go\" before each direction listed. Sometimes, however, the first word in an object's name (e.g baking soda) has to be entered, while, at on other occasions, it is the second word (e.g. rubber gloves). There are many unused items in this game, but the tasks are usually logical, even if belief has to be suspended on many occasions. There is also a time factor, so get moving!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "The Guild Adventure Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/127138-shakey-city\n"}
