{"altername_name": ["SubLogic Football"], "name": "Football (Sublogic)", "overview": "Forget everything you've seen or heard about sports simulation programs. Football sets new standards in realism and play-ability. Every player has individual physical attributes. Each player acts and moves individually on each play. And you can adjust the performance characteristics of any player, any way you like. You call the plays, offense and defense. Choose your quarterback, receivers, and running backs. Then become an active participant in the play you've selected. You control the quarterback, then control the receiver or running back once the ball is transferred. On defense, you become the in-action safety or linebacker for the play you've selected. Discover how enjoyable a football simulation can be.
