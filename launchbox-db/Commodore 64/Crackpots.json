{"altername_name": [], "name": "Crackpots", "overview": "Antonia Savona has done it again. Another stellar conversion of an Atari 2600 Activision classic to the C64. First there was his excellent conversion of Chopper Command, then there was Keystone Kapers, then Frostbite. Now comes his fourth conversion, a conversion of Dan Kitchen's classic game Crackpots. Game's description: A barrage of bugs are attacking your home, and you need to defend it with potted plants! You control your character at the top of the screen where there are six potted plants. These can be dropped on the bugs to destroy them as they make their way up from the sewer at the bottom. Just beneath the potted plants are six windows; you need to make sure you destroy the bugs before they can reach these windows. If six of the bugs make it into the windows, a layer of your house will be eaten. This will drop you one step closer to the bottom of the screen, making it more difficult to destroy the incoming bugs! There are four different color bugs in the game, each of which have a different pattern of movement. As the levels progress, bugs will keep coming faster and faster! The game ends when six layers of the building have been eaten.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "January 30, 2020", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Antonio Savona", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4i4kpt5ICNk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/124927-crackpots\n"}
