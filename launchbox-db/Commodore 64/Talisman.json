{"altername_name": [], "name": "Talisman", "overview": "The most famous Scottish trains were the Talisman and the Elizabethan. The Talisman was the heir to the pre-war streamlined morning express to Edinburgh \u2013 the Coronation \u2013 and was always hauled by the most immaculate locomotives King\u2019s Cross shed could provide. The name even lasted into the era of the \u201cHST\u201d diesel trains, before finally expiring in 1991. The Elizabethan, named for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953, was less enduring. Despite being the most heavily loaded fast train in Britain at 420 tons, it didn\u2019t even survive the diesel era, being consigned to the scrap-heap in 1961. In this train simulation you direct and manage the locomotive route to keep the trains running on time.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Dee-Kay Systems", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/123744-talisman\n"}
