{"altername_name": ["Cave Search"], "name": "Moon Crystals", "overview": "This was a Balloon Rescue style game put in a space setting and with a collect-'em-up layer added to the tense time/fuel limits. This was released as the B side game of \"To Hell and Back\". Released in Italy as Cave Search in New Special PlayGames n.13 (ottobre 1988). The brave ship has been commissioned to descend into the diamond fields of a dangerous lunar volcano: the aim of the mission is to collect as many of the Moon Crystals as possible before the volcano erupts. To do this the ship has a set of thrusters that will allow it to move quickly between the caves. Using it, however, requires some practice if you want to avoid crashing into the walls of the cave. Consumption of fuel must be watched, but you can restock by grabbing the fuel cans that have been seeded throughout the cave tunnels. Only after collecting all the gems from a section of caves will you be able to access the next set. There are 16 levels in all to complete the cave search.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Andy Jervis", "publishers": "CRL Group", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzPKXSSdQds", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/122677-moon-crystals\n"}
