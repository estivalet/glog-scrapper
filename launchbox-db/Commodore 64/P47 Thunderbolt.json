{"altername_name": ["P47"], "name": "P47 Thunderbolt", "overview": "The P-47 was one of the toughest planes in use in World War 2, and this side-scrolling shoot 'em up puts you in control of one as you take on hordes of Nazis. 16-bit versions have a simultaneous 2-player mode, as well as the ability to wrap-around the game with increased difficulty up to 4 times. You are initially armed with a machine gun, but can also pick up bombs, spray missiles and multi-missiles by picking up the appropriate letter. Each weapon can be upgraded by picking up further tokens of the same type. Tokens offering extra lives and speed-ups are also on offer.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "NMK", "publishers": "Firebird Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P47_Thunderbolt_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WO6_3rDtqM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/111779-p47-thunderbolt\n"}
