{"altername_name": ["Fadrika"], "name": "Phaedra", "overview": "In this game you have to stack polygons that rain down from the top in the most orderly way possible, matching the faces exactly and not leaving many spaces between one piece and another. If a horizontal line has no spaces then it will disappear bringing the tower of pieces lower and giving you more time to think. Finish the game when your castle reaches the top of the screen. If you fill in 150 lines you go to the next level: if you fill 3, 4 or 5 in a row you have bonus pieces to fill in the gabs that have formed. You can meditate on which position to put the piece and see the piece that will be the next in line at the top left. You can play alone or with a friend in alternating fashion or in a random pattern if you so choose at the beginning. Pressing fire rotates the pieces as they fall and if you push down the move faster. Happy puzzling.
