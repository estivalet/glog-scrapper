{"altername_name": [], "name": "U-Cube-It", "overview": "U-Cube-It is a puzzle game developed by C.E. \"Spock\" Prince and published in Loadstar #117. It is a game to tax your mental acuity, as well as your patience. This puzzle is pretty tough at the lowest level, harder at the next and a Monster at the top level. At its easiest you have 24 cubes in a 5x5 square, leaving only one empty. Each cube has four quadrants of any color. The default number of colors is 8, but can be changed. The empty square is at the top left corner and each cube's colors match with the cube next to it. Before the cubes are scrambled all the of the cubes must mach with their neighbor. Your job is to move the cubes back into their original position. You can swap a cube into the empty square by putting the cursor on the cube and clicking space. At harder levels the cubes have been moved AND rotated!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "C.E.
