{"altername_name": [], "name": "Boxymoxy", "overview": "Inspired by Lobo's cat Gelsomina, with a little Sokoban and a tiny dash of Angry Birds thrown in for flavour, Boxymoxy is a game about moving cats and smashing skulls using the power of logic. The stupid old Wizard had cast a wrong spell, creating an invasion of chattering skulls and now no one can sleep! Two cats, Boxy and Moxy, are set to clean up this mess. Using their combined powers, you will traverse 60 levels over three areas in order to destroy all skulls and restore the beauty sleep to the people of the old Kingdom! Featuring 60 challenging puzzles, unique gameplay, a player performance-graded progress system with on-cartridge saving, 15 digitally-sampled and distinct meows from 12 cats and full PAL/NTSC compatibility.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "August 10, 2020", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Pirates of Zanzibar", "publishers": "RGCD", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4c3CER_plQo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/142404-boxymoxy\n"}
