{"altername_name": ["Alternative World Games", "Sports-a-Roni", "Sports-A-Roni"], "name": "Sports-A-Roni", "overview": "Sporta-a-Roni (Alternative World Games in Europe) is a sports game with eight extraordinary sports: sack race, boot throwing, pole climbing, running up the wall, balancing a pile of plates, jumping over a river, a pillow fight and pogo. At the beginning of the game you enter your name (confirm with \"Return\"). Of course, here you can play for the country of your choice. For this, you pick a record with the flag of your choice out of the LP box and a parrot, which sits next to it, takes out the LP with its beak and puts it on the phonograph (joystick forward/ backward, then fire). Then the hymn is played. This can be repeated until the names of all players have been entered, to finish you press \"Return\" in an empty name field. When you have entered all players you get into a screen, in which you can choose what sports you want to play. By moving the joystick forward/ backward you set in the \"video recorder\" in the lower left corner the number of the sports event and press fire. Now a nicely animated picture of the sport appears on the corresponding screen. When you have chosen all your desired events you set to \"9\". By moving the joystick left/right you can choose between \"Compete\" and \"Practice\". By pressing fire the competition or training starts with the previously set options.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gremlin Graphics Software", "publishers": "Gremlin Graphics Software", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "6", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_World_Games", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZph-reSRwg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/95736-sports-a-roni\n"}
