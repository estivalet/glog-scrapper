{"altername_name": [], "name": "Commando 2084", "overview": "Earned 2nd place in the WiLD Demo Competition at Flashparty 2019. Commando 2084 is the mix between Commando and Robotron 2084: it is like the original Commando game, but using the Robotron 2084 controls. Levels 2 and 3 have bosses (enemies taken from Robotron 2084) The SFX used when these bossed are killed, are unused SFX from the original Commando. Difficulty increased, otherwise the game would be too easy to play: - No extra lives, - 28 soldiers are inside forts, instead of 20.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "September 28, 2019", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ricardo Quesada", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIC46pllu4A", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/129463-commando-2084\n"}
