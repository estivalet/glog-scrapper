{"altername_name": [], "name": "Age of Adventure", "overview": "Billed as \"the greatest adventures in history,\" this game was actually two games in one: The Return of Heracles and Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves. Both games are somewhat similarly constructed, as they were built on an engine that is a precursor to Stuart Smith's Adventure Construction Set. Control multiple characters via a top-down perspective on various quests throughout the mythological past. Find items, increase your stats, battle monsters, and explore the land in these turn-based RPGs. Both games feature a cooperative component that lets any number of players play together, simply by dividing up the available characters.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Stuart Smith", "publishers": "Electronic Arts Inc.", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "8", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86754-age-of-adventure\n"}
