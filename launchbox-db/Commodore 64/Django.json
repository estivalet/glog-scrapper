{"altername_name": ["Abilene"], "name": "Django", "overview": "What do you think of being transported in a time machine, to the old West, where the only way to survive is to shoot before others shoot you? The aim of the game is just that: to survive the attack of armed gangsters who try to kill you. For each criminal killed you get a reward, but be careful to not hit the poor defenseless people walking n the streets. If you do, you will be penalized and required to pay a reward to the loved ones of the deceased. Fortunately at the end of your labors you can go to the saloon and participate in a good game of Blackjack.
