{"altername_name": [], "name": "Chopper Flight", "overview": "In Chopper Flight, you are a civilian helicopter pilot who has been called upon by his country to fly a rescue mission, A group of ruthless terrorists have captured two adjacent apartment buildings in your city and are holding all the tenants hostage. If their demands are not met in one hour, they threaten to blow up the building, killing themselves and all of the inhabitants. The nearest military helicopter base is too far away to send help in time, so you have been asked to use your own personal chopper to rescue the hostages. However, the terrorists don't appreciate your sense of duty and they start to five anti-aircraft shells at you. Shortly before a shell is fired, you will hear a warning noise. If you hurry, you can guide your chopper onto a ledge where you will have some measure of safety. When the terrorists realize that you could ruin their plans, they send for a heat-seeking missile which automatically homes in on your chopper. However, before the missile is fired, the border of the screen will turn orange and then red. This is a warning that your time is almost up. As the game begins, you are asked to enter the difficulty of the mission. The skill level ranges from one to six, one being the easiest, six being the hardest. The height of the building and the amount of time before the heatseeking missile is fired depend on the skill level you select. Also, your maneuverability varies with the difficulty of your mission. To maneuver your chopper, use a joystick plugged into control port 2. To control your rate of descent, hold down the fire button on your controller. After a short period of holding down the button, your helicopter will begin to hover. At this point you can maneuver your craft between the ledges to rescue the hostages. Releasing the fire button will cause the chopper to begin descending again. Movement in all eight directions is possible. However, do not try to move your chopper off the top or bottom of the screen; once a section of the building has scrolled off the top of the screen, it is gone and you cannot go back to it. Likewise, the only way to descend to the lower parts of the building is to allow your chopper to drop by releasing the fire button. On every fourth floor of one of the buildings, you will see a hostage standing on a ledge. To save him, slow your chopper's downward fall to a hover and maneuver your chopper between the ledges. As soon as you touch the hostage, he is replaced by a heart symbol to show that they are safely on board. If you allow a hostage to scroll off the top of the screen, he is beyond help and you cannot save him. If you are able to reach the bottom without crashing into the building, being hit by a shell, or running out of time, you will receive one hundred points for every man you have rescued. Also, extra points are awarded for the difficulty of your mission and for completing it in the least amount of time.Released in Ahoy! 1985/11 (Issue #23).", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kevin Woram", "publishers": "Ion International, Inc.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sG5ERk7wHa8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90661-chopper-flight\n"}
