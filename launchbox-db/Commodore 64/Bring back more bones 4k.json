{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bring back more bones 4k", "overview": "Buckle up, beat the beasts, and... bring back my bones! In this swift shoot-n-collect pseudo 3D game, you are to bring together the scattered bones of your crazy uncle. He may have left you a hefty sum... but you won't know it until you talk to his ghost, stuck in between worlds. So venture into the dark forest to gather all his bones. Watch out though - it's no mushroom picking. His earthly remains are closely guarded by some seriously scary soul-devouring beasts. Once you've got them all, cook up some fresh broth - and hear back from your uncle! Bones, beasts, and broth - what a craptastic story!
