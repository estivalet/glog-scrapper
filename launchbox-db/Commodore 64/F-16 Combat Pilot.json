{"altername_name": ["F/16 Combat Pilot"], "name": "F-16 Combat Pilot", "overview": "True to the aircraft\u2019s flexibility, you pilot the F-16 in assignments as diverse as dogfights, bombing raids or reconnaissance missions. It is up to you to plan your flight route by setting way-points on the tactical map prior to take-off; you can also (but need not) select the armament of your plane. When you have accumulated enough flight experience, you may command entire squadrons in the fictional Operation Conquest campaign, a simple simulation of an entire war theater that already hinted at what would later become DI\u2019s Virtual Battlefield. It is considered as one of the first combat flight simulators to have a dynamic campaign environment. While the graphics, scenery and audio are quite sparse and basic, the instruments and flight dynamics of a F-16C Fighting Falcon are fully featured and modeled. F-16 Combat Pilot allows multiplayer duels via modem or serial link.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Black Box", "publishers": "Digital Integration", "genres": "Flight Simulator", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-16_Combat_Pilot", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYoFHVXr6cI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/95761-f-16-combat-pilot\n"}
