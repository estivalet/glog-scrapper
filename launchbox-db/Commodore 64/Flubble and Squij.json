{"altername_name": [], "name": "Flubble and Squij", "overview": "The normally peaceful day-to-day existence of Flubble has been rudely interrupted by the unexpected arrival of some nasty alien creatures! The creatures have frightened Flubbles friends, the timid Squij's, causing them to run away and hide. As Flubble is a decent little dragon he has taken it up himself to collect all the Squij's to keep them safe from harm. Flubble can eat tasty MAGIC MUSHROOMS along the way - which can both help or hinder him, depending on the effect they have on him. You must help Flubble to find all the Squij's on each level, avoid the roaming creatures - or splatter them using your tail-spin attack, and once you have found all the Squij's, escape to the next level via the exit duct.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2013", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jonathan Wells", "publishers": "Psytronik Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKknqXimMIs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/101253-flubble-and-squij\n"}
