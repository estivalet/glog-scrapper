{"altername_name": ["Fernando Mart\u00edn Basket Master", "US Basket Master"], "name": "Basket Master", "overview": "\"Basket Master\" is a one-on-one basketball game from premier Spanish developer Dinamic Soft, dedicated to NBA player Fernando Mart\u00edn, the first Spanish (and first European non-student in a US university) to play in the NBA, who tragically died 3 years later in a traffic accident at the age of 28. The focus is on pure, unadulterated action here: just choose one- or two-player game, and presto-- you'll be out on a CGA court trying to score.
