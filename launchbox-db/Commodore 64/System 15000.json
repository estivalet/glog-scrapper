{"altername_name": [], "name": "System 15000", "overview": "The game box includes a letter which provides background information to establish the premise of the game. Written to the main character from the perspective of a friend \"Mike\", it outlines how (a presumed mutual friend) Richard's company, Comdata, has had $1.5 million stolen by a rival company named Realco. Furthermore, the police are unable to retrieve the money, so the player is required to hack into a computer system and retrieve the funds. The letter provides a single phone number and entry code, part of the game's simulation of dialing into databases and bulletin boards. The player has to figure out how to get into the proper database to take back the cash.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "John Wagstaff", "publishers": "AVS", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_15000", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wNhJSSNNxc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113578-system-15000\n"}
