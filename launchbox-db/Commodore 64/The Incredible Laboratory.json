You are a MAD SCIENTIST, world famous for creating MONSTERS out of a variety of chemicals (such as Fuzzy Mold, Bubbling Mud, and StinkySocks). The only problem is, sometimes you forget what chemicals create which body parts for monsters!

The Wizard suggests that you take nifty notes and record your results so you don't have to rely upon your MAD memory!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Eric Grubbs", "publishers": "Sunburst Communications Inc.", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Mh57vg4eI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106508-the-incredible-laboratory\n"}
