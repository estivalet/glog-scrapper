{"altername_name": ["DEA"], "name": "Ala", "overview": "A short entry for a title which was reportedly for Mastertronic back in 1988, but for reasons currently unknown never quite made it in the UK. The game was being developed by Reptilia Design, with code by Andy Syco (of Werewolves in London fame), graphics by Blancmange and sound by Neil Baldwin. It seems the cracking crew \u2013 Fusion, got hold of a pre-release version of the game and leaked it. Is this the reason why the game didn\u2019t get officially released by Mastertronic? When you load up the preview \u2013 there isn\u2019t a huge amount to do. You control a large flying guy, who has a limited range of shooting, and must scroll along horizontally \u2013 attacked by a series of unimaginative attack waves. There are no backgrounds or anything else of note, which suggests that this game was at a very early stage. Code was cleaned up and eventually released in Italy in Alga Soft 1988 n.6a.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Andy Syco", "publishers": "Mastertronic, Inc.", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgKGnminvNA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86779-ala\n"}
