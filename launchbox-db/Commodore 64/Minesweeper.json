{"altername_name": [], "name": "Minesweeper", "overview": "A nice version of minesweeper that was published in Magic Disk 64 1995/04. Minesweeper demands your full concentration: this is about the targeted defusing of bombs! At the beginning you will see some numbers and boxes on the playing field. The numbers provide information about how many bombs are hidden in the immediate vicinity (i.e. a box!). Now you have to deduce logically where there are bombs and where they are not. Pressing the fire button once (joystick in port # 2) marks a field as a bomb and pressing it twice reveals a field. If you uncover a field and unexpectedly a bomb appears, the game is over.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Frank J\u00fcrke", "publishers": "CP Verlag", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75965-minesweeper\n"}
