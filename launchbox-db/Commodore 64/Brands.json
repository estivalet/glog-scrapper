{"altername_name": ["Brands Deluxe", "Super Race"], "name": "Brands", "overview": "Brands (called Brands Deluxe on the title screen) is a top view single player driving/racing game where the screen scrolls upwards constantly as you drive your racing car and attempt to overtake as many other cars for as long as possible. You can move your car left or right, and you can select either a low or high gear, but you only score points in high gear. Occasionally you will have to drive at night where the whole screen goes blank except for a beam of light from the front of your car and the other cars can only be seen in the light. The road will also narrow in places, with a sign warning you as you approach it. If you hit another car then you lose one of four lives, and you can select the difficulty (1 - 4) at the start of the game, with one being the hardest.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Antony Crowther", "publishers": "Alligata Software", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCxvrc-TNa0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90030-brands\n"}
