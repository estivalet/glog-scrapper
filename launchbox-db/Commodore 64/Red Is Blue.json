The aim of the game is to answer as quickly as possiblr if a word displayed on the screen corresponds to its color. For example, if a play sees \"red\" written in blakc, this is incorrect so they have to choose a \"false\" asnwer by moving a joystick in the left direction. If a player sees \"pink\" written in pink, this is a correct answer so they have to answer a \"true\" answer by moving a joystick in the right direction. Up to 4 players can play simultaneously. There are 20 words displayed per game, each one worth max. 100 points is answered correctly. If the answer is incorrect, the player doesn't earn any points. The maxium amount of 100 points goes down to zero within each millisecond, so players have to hurry before the next word will appear on the screen.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2021", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Commocore", "publishers": "PhoenixWare", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/369368-red-is-blue\n"}
