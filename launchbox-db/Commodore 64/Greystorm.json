{"altername_name": [], "name": "Greystorm", "overview": "After an accident occurred during the testing of a newly developed time machine, you find yourself transported back in time and must travel trough different time periods to get back home. Greystorm is a sidescrolling platformer/shooter. You can jump, crouch and shoot. There are six levels, each with its own theme: Stone Age, Dark Jungle, Modern Times, Techno City, Waterfalls and Middle Ages. To complete a level, a certain number of items has to be collected. However, a new item only appears after the previous item has been collected, which means that completing a level requires a lot of going back and forth.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dominator Designs", "publishers": "CP Verlag", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYvgRppxfes", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/102836-greystorm\n"}
