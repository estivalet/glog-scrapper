{"altername_name": ["Maze Escape"], "name": "Crystallus", "overview": "You are trapped in a huge complex maze made up of 36 interconnecting cubicles. Each cubicle in the maze contains shimmering crystals that emit audible tones when gathered. These tones are then absorbed into the walls of the structure. When all the tones have sounded, the structure will echo the melody of tones, causing a secret passage to open. The passage will be visible in an outer wall at the top or bottom of the maze. As you leave the maze, you will enter the courtyard which is surrounded by a brick wall. Somewhere in this wall will be an opening, your final hurdle to escape from Crystallus. This game is different from most in that there is no scoring involved. You merely must finish your task to escape. from the maze that bars your freedom.Ahoy! 1987/09 (Issue #45).", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bob Blackmer", "publishers": "Ion International, Inc.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/95213-crystallus\n"}
