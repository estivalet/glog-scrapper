{"altername_name": [], "name": "Solar Jetman", "overview": "Shortly after the initial Arcade release, Sales Curve Interactive announced ports of Solar Jetman for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Atari ST and Commodore Amiga, all developed by Software Creations and intended for release on the STORM label. The Commodore 64, Amiga and Atari ST versions were complete and the ZX Spectrum reached a playable demo state, before the project was cancelled due to poor sales of the NES original and perceived unsuitability for the home computer markets. The Commodore 64 version has subsequently been discovered and made available for download.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "John Buckley", "publishers": "", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_Jetman", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/122840-solar-jetman\n"}
