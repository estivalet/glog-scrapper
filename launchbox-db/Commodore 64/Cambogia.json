{"altername_name": ["Cecchino"], "name": "Cambogia", "overview": "A jungle war themed cross-hairs shooter, published in Commodore 64 Club #11 [Italian Release] aka Lamer Wars, also published under the name Cecchino in both Supplementi Edigamma/pubblirome - big 100 (1987) and in Super C64 e C128 n.33 (aprile 1989), the name means Sniper. A sniper is an exceptionally gifted and well trained soldier who is taught both to fire and to lurk in camouflaged hiding places to shoot any enemies that come within range. In this game you are one of those sniers and you have to hit as many enemies as possible. You have a limited number of bullets at your disposal and so you have to be careful not to waste any. Use the crosshairs to frame the enemy and press fire. The enemy moves fast and has heavy vehicles it his disposal, which must be hit several times. If you fail to hit the enemy long enough he will find you and begin to hit you. If you take 4 hits you are surely lost.
