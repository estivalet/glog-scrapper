{"altername_name": [], "name": "Empire Strikes Back (2022)", "overview": "The Empire Strikes Back is an unofficial conversion of the Atari 2600/Mattel Intellivision game of the same name. This game was developed by a droup of people with the scene group Megastyle. Development of the game was started back in early 2020 with a couple of preview/playable demo versions released during the development time, but the full game was not released until May 4, 2022. Game description: Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back recreates a scene from the movie of the same name. You are on the icy planet of Hoth, and Imperial Walkers are closing in on the rebel power generator. As the pilot of a snowspeeder, you need to take out as many of the walkers as you can. The walkers are heavily armored, and it will take a lot of firepower to destroy one! The game is played on a large, scrolling screen with a radar screen at the bottom to help keep track of where the enemy is located. If a walker reaches the power generator, or you run out of snowspeeders the game is over. Good luck, and may the force be with you!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "May 4, 2022", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Megastyle", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqsuvDiTboA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161649-empire-strikes-back-2022\n"}
