{"altername_name": [], "name": "Exploding Atoms", "overview": "Exploding Atoms is an exciting game for two players, which amazes with surprising twists, especially shortly before the end of the game. A screen appears with 6 x 8 fields, occupied by 46 neutral atoms (green) and two player atoms (light blue player 1, dark blue player 2). The players now alternately add an electron to an atom using the joysticks, whereby only neutral atoms and one's own atoms may be supplemented with electrons. If an atom orbits a critical number of electrons! and get another electron!, it explodes and distributes its electrons to the surrounding atoms (which take on the color of the player). Whoever controls all the atoms wins. The more the atoms of the playing field are enriched with electrons, the more surprising turns the game can take.
