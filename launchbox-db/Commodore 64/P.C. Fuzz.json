{"altername_name": ["Schupos"], "name": "P.C. Fuzz", "overview": "As a police constable, you must patrol a busy street while on the lookout for cars, punks, and robbers. When a robber appears, you must arrest them by knocking them out with your club and then transporting them to the police van before they have a chance to enter one of the buildings that line the street and make off with some cash. You can also club punks that come out of nearby alleys. Occasionally, balloons holding money bags will float across the screen. Hitting these will award you with bonus points.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jef.
