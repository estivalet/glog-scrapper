{"altername_name": [], "name": "Creeping Chromosomes", "overview": "A strategy game created by Fender Tucker and released in both Loadstar #031 in 1986, and later in Best of Loadstar #3. There have been several computer programs that simulate the growth of organisms in particular environments. Known as \"life\" games, these programs most often use an algorithm based on the reproduction of cells in a bacteria colony. You can think of Creeping Chromosomes as a lighthearted version of The Game of Life. But while you might recognize the chromosomes and amino acids from what you've learned in biology class, we don't pretend that this game is a realistic simulation of how chromosomes behave in real life. Hopefully you will find a scientific method to our madness. Here, you get a chance to perform experiments in controlled evolution. Your goal: develop chromosomes with the best chances of survival in a predetermined environment. The chromosomes you deal with compete with one another for survival. Two traits determine the success of a chromosome: curiosity and strength. Curiosity determines mobility and mobile chromosomes are more likely to bump into the amino acids that they need to replicate and grow. Strength is important as when a strong chromosome touches a weak one's head, the weaker one is eliminated. As curiosity increases, strength naturally decreases, so a balance is best for survival.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Fender Tucker", "publishers": "Softdisk Publishing, Inc.", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/94940-creeping-chromosomes\n"}
