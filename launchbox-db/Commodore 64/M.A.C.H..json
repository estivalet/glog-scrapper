{"altername_name": ["Maneuverable Armed Computer Humans"], "name": "M.A.C.H.", "overview": "An evil robot called Nektron has enslaved three planets and it's the player's job to take on the role of a Maneuverable Armed Computer Human and free the planets. The action takes places in multi-directionally scrolling stages seen from a top-down perspective. The goal of each of the three stages is to destroy a set number of certain types of enemies. Beginning with the weak Vacilators, followed by the more resilient and heavily armed Gyphons and finally, large mother-ships. There are many other types of enemies as well. They will sometimes drop power-ups that replenish energy or give access to more powerful weapons. The game gets increasingly difficult as the number of enemies that have to be destroyed increases and mother-ships start appearing several times throughout a level.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Starvision", "publishers": "Innerprise Software, Inc.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOzS_dtGYUI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/95985-mach\n"}
