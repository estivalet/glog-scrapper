Each level can have different set of paddles, sometimes one at the top and one at the bottom, sometimes one left one right, sometimes four stacked-up etc. This gives each level a distinctly new gameplay. There are unbreakable blocks, monster generators (also unbreakable) and glass refractors that change the balls movement angle as it passes through. After a level is cleared, the player must choose the next level by moving on a 8x8 grid of levels", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "March 22, 1988", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Damon Redmond", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/131943-traz-iii\n"}
