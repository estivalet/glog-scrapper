{"altername_name": [], "name": "Acme Bricks", "overview": "Break Out with a big difference. Instead of chipping away at a huge chunk of bricks, you only break tiny pieces. Try and smash all of the bricks to reach the very next level, but watch out because if you let a ball escape, a life is lost. Once all lives are lost, the game is over. The front end of this game consists of some very amusing music. Crazy game, probably good fun as well.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2007", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Richard Bayliss", "publishers": "The New Dimension (TND)", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.62", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86652-acme-bricks\n"}
