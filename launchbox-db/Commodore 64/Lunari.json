{"altername_name": ["L.E.M."], "name": "Lunari", "overview": "A Uridium style shooter. Man's adventure in space requires a series of tools that can allow survival in a hostile environment or in any case, unsuitable for normal human functions. The problem of the lack of the force of gravity can skew both physical and mental equilibrium. The danger of exposure to cosmic rays, extreme and fluctuating temperatures and lack of gasses necessary for breathing along with the normal hardships and difficulties that arise create the need for a protective shell within which we can recreate the environmental conditions existing on Earth. All this to allow men and women to carry out the work of the day. This led to the creation of the spacecraft: a vehicle that is sturdy, thermally insulated, and can maneuver to allow travel in space. Equipped with rocket engines controlled by the human pilots in a manner similar to aircraft. Every system must be reliable and redundant to ensure that a small inconvenience doesn't turn the crew into a bright red stain. Unfortunately, in the course of human events, one of these ships must wage war against another, and take on the defenses of a large space station in the process, so grab the controls safe in the knowledge that your incredibly advanced ship was created by the lowest military bidder and hope there are no brightly colored inconveniences in your future.
