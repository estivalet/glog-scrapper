Johnson)", "overview": "The object of this game is to fly your aircraft from London, Heathrow to any one of 8 other airports within the U.K. These are displayed on a map of the U.K. and can be recalled at any time during the game to show your location. You can fly to Gatwick, Luton, West Midlands, Norwich, Manchester, Newcastle, Prestwick or Exeter. You must avoid crashing by controlling altitude, speed, location, landing gear, distance measuring equipment and flaps at the same time. It's not easy, but it can be done!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "C.
