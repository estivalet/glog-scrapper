{"altername_name": [], "name": "Blaster", "overview": "A shooter, created by Ulrich M\u00fchl and published in Compute mit magazine in 1987/10. After all previous attempts by the Torican to conquer Earth conquer and enslave, have failed, the wicked liens have now come up with something new! To more quickly get to Earth, from their planet, they built a HyperBridge that leads directly to Earth (then they don't get lost quite so often!). Of course. The sensitive radar antennas of the secret military base, headed by Dr. Beuermannst, have discovered the plan in its initial stage, so that adequate measures to stop them can be taken. One of these actions will alert you, General Hadok, with your winning smile and your perfect hair. As your doorbell rings, you answer and are told that, once again you have been chosen to save the earth! You must! BLASTER, the absolute newest and most secret development of M\u00fcspace has been provided to you to end the situation. You can destroy the bridge parts again. Since the Tonicans are not completely dumb, they have left six guard units on each section, Once eliminated, the BLASTER automatically dissolves the bridge section.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ulrich M\u00fchl", "publishers": "Compute mit", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/88530-blaster\n"}
