{"altername_name": [], "name": "Across the Space One", "overview": "Developed in 2015 by Roberto Ricioppo using SEUCK, this shooter has no real story. The goal is simple, destroy the waves of alien baddies in every sector until 1. The game ends or 2. You lose all your lives. Unlike a good portion of SEUCK games on TND, the music was not done by Richard Bayliss, rather Ricioppo did the music on this one himself.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2015", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Roberto Ricioppo", "publishers": "The New Dimension (TND)", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/155396-across-the-space-one\n"}
