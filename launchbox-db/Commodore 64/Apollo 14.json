{"altername_name": [], "name": "Apollo 14", "overview": "A great looking game in similar style to the first part of Dynamic\u2019s \"Game Over\", with some awesome graphics in similar style to those common with X-Ample games of the early 90\u2019s. This game is not based on any moon landings or space trips, but of a space man who roams around various flick-screen colourful rooms of shooting pods and robots, all of which animate beautifully. Not only that, but the main character is well defined with a hi-res overlay and great animation. Only released as preview, full game never released.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Irek Rozychi", "publishers": "", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h1lHKIRPhk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161249-apollo-14\n"}
