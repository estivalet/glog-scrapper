{"altername_name": ["Cyberwing"], "name": "Cyber Wing", "overview": "Nobody is quite sure where the aliens came from, but the have ransacked our galaxy and left a trail of destruction through five colony structures. All communication with Earth has been cut, we have no way of warning them. Your mission is to take remote control of a Cyberwing Mk. 3 mid-range fighter and navigate through the five colonies to get a message through, taking out as many enemy fighters as you can on your way. To assist you the Cyberwing Mk. 3 has a standard issue plasma cannon and has been fitted with five particle disseminator destructors (or mattersplatter bombs). The man cannons can be activated with the trigger on your control stick and a mattersplatter is fired with the spacebar. The mission can be paused at any time with the run/stop key (fire restarts) and aborted with the Q key. Should the Cyberwing be destroyed we have two more units that can be beamed in to carry on the fight and extra units will be assigned as you prove yourself worthy of the resources. Good luck commander, a Cyberwing is ready for immediate launch.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Cosine Systems", "publishers": "Cronosoft", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVBRlLXhdzo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75444-cyber-wing\n"}
