{"altername_name": [], "name": "Kobo64", "overview": "RGCD C64 16KB Cartridge Game Development Competition 2013. Published in the Reset #11 Mix-i-Disk. Kobo64 is a stunning port of Kobo Deluxe and was originally entered in the 2013 RGCD 16kb Cartridge Game Competition, placing an impressive 4th overall. Since the original compo release, the game has been enhanced and updated several times and this version was released in February 2018. Kobo is a multi-directionally scrolling arcade blaster in which you must clear each level of the alien labyrinth space stations. This is done by shooting the blue spheres on the edge of the labyrinth walls, making your way to the centre of the stations and destroying them. Sounds simple enough but be warned, it may start off slow and steady but things get extremely hectic very quickly!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "December 1, 2013", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Zsolt Kajt\u00e1r (Soci/Singular)", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcePeqvrKbw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75930-kobo64\n"}
