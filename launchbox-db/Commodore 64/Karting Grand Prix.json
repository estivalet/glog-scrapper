{"altername_name": [], "name": "Karting Grand Prix", "overview": "With 8 circuits to race on against 2 opponents (one of which can also be human-controlled), this racing game is viewed from above and resembles Super Sprint and early budget-price imitations such as Grand Prix Simulator. Tracks can be raced in the wet, dry or on ice - don't forget to alter the tyre selection to suit. Contact with other cars weakens these tyres and can eventually cause punctures. Each race is of a varying number of laps depending on the track's length and complexity. Sound effects have been sampled, giving the game a realistic sound unusual at the time.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "J\u00f6rg Dierks", "publishers": "Kingsoft", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/107388-karting-grand-prix\n"}
