{"altername_name": ["Grand Prix Simulator II"], "name": "Grand Prix Simulator 2", "overview": "A sequel to the previous Grand Prix Simulator, a popular Super Sprint style racing game. As before, the action is viewed from overhead across a succession of tracks featuring hairpins, oil slicks and similar hazards. You must complete each race within the time limit; and time left after one race is added to your allowance on the next one. After the race you can view a replay. The two main new features are a 3-player mode (there are always 3 cars present in total) and a damage meter which mean that repeat contract with barriers or other cars hampers your performance.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Codemasters Software", "publishers": "Codemasters Software", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "3", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tO1pUaNFrog", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/102711-grand-prix-simulator-2\n"}
