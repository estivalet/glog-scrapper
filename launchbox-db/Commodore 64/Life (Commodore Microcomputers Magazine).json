{"altername_name": [], "name": "Life (Commodore Microcomputers Magazine)", "overview": "Life is a computerized version of Conway's Game of Life. It was developed by Cyndie Merten and published in Commodore Microcomputers Magazine 1985/06, and also released as part of Loadstar #012. Life simulates the growth and decay cycle of organisms. Processes like this are done to predict the growth of bacteria and the like in laboratory experiments. The concept was developed by John Horton Conway at the University of Cambridge. The rules are simple: 1. Any organism surrounded by two or 3 neighbors survives. 2. Four or more neighbors spells death for an organism due to overpopulation. 3. No neighbors or only one also spells death due to isolation. 4. An empty cell with exactly 3 neighbors will have an organism born into it. There are two versions of the game included. The first version creates random starting patterns. The other allows you to set the pattern. Press the * to place a cell. Press the space bar to erase the cell. Press return to begin the lifecycle.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Cyndie Merten", "publishers": "Commodore Microcomputers Magazine", "genres": "Life Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/121522-life-commodore-microcomputers-magazine\n"}
