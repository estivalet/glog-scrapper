{"altername_name": [], "name": "Orange Squash", "overview": "Orange Squash is a single screen platformer where you play the role of Oswald the Orange, trying to escape his packing case in the ACME fruit processing factory in the Spanish countryside, to stop being turned into pure orange juice. On each screen is a flag and you must navigate the platforms using smaller ones to get higher, and ropes to get lower, and touch the flag, before your juice gauge empties. The juice gauge is constantly decreasing but you can collect lemons on the way to keep increasing it. There are various creatures on the screen that can be avoided or shot but shot creatures appear again after a couple of seconds. If you are hit or shot by a creature, you lose part of your juice gauge and are taken back to the start of the screen. Once the juice gauge is empty then it is game over and before you start a game, you have the choice of five skill levels (1-5).", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jason H.
