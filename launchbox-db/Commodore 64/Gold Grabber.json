{"altername_name": ["Lode Runner Jr."], "name": "Gold Grabber", "overview": "Gold Grabber (also called Lode Runner Jr.) is a single-screen platformer developed by Andrew S. Pakerski and published in 1986 by Softalk Production in Loadstar #20. There are only about 6 screens in total, however, every time you complete all screens, the screens just repeat and increase in speed every time you have to repeat each screen, so the disappearing platforms speed up every time you play each screen, which makes the game a bit more challenging.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Andrew S.
