{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bobby Bearing", "overview": "The player controls Bobby Bearing in his search for his four lost brothers and their cousin. He must avoid the evil Bearings, find his missing and unconscious relatives, and roll them out of the Metaplanes to safety. The mission must be accomplished before the time limit runs out, otherwise the game ends and Bobby's relatives are lost forever. A time penalty is incurred each time Bobby dies or is stunned. If Bobby is trapped and unable to leave a screen, pressing 'Q' will reset the screen at the cost of a time penalty. Air vents, lifts, switches, crushers and evil Bearings can help or hinder Bobby in his quest.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "July 15, 1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Robert Figgins, Trevor Figgins", "publishers": "The Edge", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.07", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Bearing", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXZtzbKYwpI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6493-bobby-bearing\n"}
