{"altername_name": [], "name": "Area 13", "overview": "Area 13 is a 2 player duel shoot 'em up game for the Commodore 64. In the game, you and your opponent are both on jetpacks in the middle of space. Unlike most games of this type, instead of having to reach a certain set score, the goal is to be the first to not run out of energy. However, there is a twist to this game: not only do you (or the AI player as well) have to deal with each other's bullets, they also have to contend with flying space rocks that can also deplete your energy, also hitting the pink/magenta colored force fields at the bottom and top of the screen result in an INSTANT loss of game for a player. Good luck! The game was developed by Hans-Werner M\u00fcller and published in 1993 in the following: \u2022 64'er 1991/03 \u2022 64'er Sonderheft 79", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hans-Werner M\u00fcller", "publishers": "Markt & Technik", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/169688-area-13\n"}
