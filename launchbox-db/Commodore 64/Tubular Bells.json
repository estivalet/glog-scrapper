{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tubular Bells", "overview": "This is more demo than game, a SID tour de force second combining art and melody into a wonderful ethereal experience. With the aid of the software house CRL and distributor Nu Wave, Mike Oldfield released an interactive Commodore 64 version of the album in 1986, which used the computer's SID sound chip to play back a simplified re-arrangement of the album, accompanied by some 2D visual effects. The \"interactivity\" offered by the album/program was limited to controlling the speed and quantity of the visual effects, tuning the sound's volume and filtering, and skipping to any part of the album.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "CRL (Computer Rentals Limited)", "publishers": "Nu Wave", "genres": "Music", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/114042-tubular-bells\n"}
