{"altername_name": [], "name": "PET Checkers", "overview": "PET Checkers allows the player to play checkers against the computer. The standard international rules apply: taking turns the player may move any piece one tile diagonally as long as that tile is free. Normal pieces can only move towards the other player, but once a piece reaches the other side of the board, it is crowned and can from then on move in both directions. Pieces can be hit by being jumped over. The first player to lose all pieces loses the game. The game keeps track of the time and uses field number input to determine moves. This game was originally created for the Commodore PET computer, but as it could also be run on later Commodore Machines, they were some of the first games available for the new platform.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1980", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "CMS Software Systems", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/123933-pet-checkers\n"}
