{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pride", "overview": "A puzzle game of skill which tests your responsiveness and dexterity created by Matthias Weber and published in Magic Disk 64 1991/06. The basic idea of PRIDE is to eliminate a number of coloured pieces and to go to the next level. Here is a somewhat more detailed explanation. You control a ball with the joystick, with which you can and should make the coloured tokens disappear when touched. There are three good reasons for this: Firstly, you get points for each stone eliminated in your score account. Second, reaching the exit is punished with immediate screen death, as long as there are coloured stones somewhere on the screen. Third, the path to the exit usually leads inevitably over a large number of these tokens, which must then be cleared out of the way in order to reach it. So far - well, this game shouldn't cause any problems, you might think now. Not at all, as I would like to say. . . . The crux is that your ball can only remove a piece from the screen if it is the same colour as the stone to be removed. Humanly, at PRIDE there is the possibility to recolour the ball as needed, using paint buckets, which are shown here as normal coloured stones with an ornate decoration. However, these paint buckets can only be used once in each level, after this use they dissolve in air. This is also the real difficulty of PRIDE. Since you can no longer colour the ball back into a certain colour, you should think carefully about which colour to start with - if you have a choice.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Matthias Weber", "publishers": "CP Verlag", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPdmAERdPbg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/124328-pride\n"}
