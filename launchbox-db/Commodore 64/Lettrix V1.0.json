{"altername_name": ["Fill Up"], "name": "Lettrix V1.0", "overview": "Lettrix is a puzzle game in which the player gets presented with a structure, e.g. a big \"A\". This needs to be rebuilt by using eight differently formed blocks (some reminiscent of Tetris shapes) which can be rotated and placed on the playfield. Those blocks are limited in number, e.g. the player may have ten of one and six of another available to use. Wrongly placed blocks can be picked up again, but the player fights against a time limit. When playing with two players, they work together at the same puzzle and alternate their moves.
