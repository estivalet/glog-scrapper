{"altername_name": [], "name": "Kalah (RUN)", "overview": "Based on a popular African pastime that involves moving counters, usually pebbles, among 14 pits dug in the ground. The object of the game is to accumulate more stones in your home pit than the computer does in its pit. First player is chosen randomly. Mancala is essentially a game in which players \"sow\" and \"capture\" seeds. The game begins with one player picking up all of the pieces in any one of the holes on their side. Moving counter-clockwise, the player deposits one of the stones in each hole until the stones run out. If you run into your own store, deposit one piece in it. If you run into your opponent's store, skip it. If the last piece you drop is in your own store, you get a free turn. If the last piece you drop is in an empty hole on your side, you capture that piece and any pieces in the hole directly opposite. Always place all captured pieces in your store. The game ends when all six spaces on one side of the Mancala board are empty. The player who still has pieces on his side of the board when the game ends capture all of those pieces. Count all the pieces in each store. The winner is the player with the most pieces.
