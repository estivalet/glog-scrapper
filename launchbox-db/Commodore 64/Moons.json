{"altername_name": [], "name": "Moons", "overview": "A single-player shooter, created by Hannes Sommer and published in both 64'er 1992/09 and 64'er 1997/12. So get your joysticks ready and off you go into battle against the enemy fighters. Their elite units are called to arms by the Central Council of Humanity and the denizens of the worlds hope for a victory against the behemoths. The task is to eliminate the hordes and to destroy their space cruisers, on which new combat machines are constantly being developed and built... Ever since the fateful experiment on the planet Gerkatas, humanity has been on alert. A dozen worlds have already had to abandon their inhabitants to the biomechanical monsters bred on Garkatas. These creatures are extremely intelligent and very aggressive. Actually, one wanted to colonize worlds with the beings that were uninhabitable for humans and to cultivate them with the help of bio-creations. But after the generator for the charisma insert complex failed, the experiment went awry and the new beings evolved into predatory, murderous monsters. Now the beings want to wipe out humanity and take possession of the universe. So they have built space fleets with gigantic ships and are heading for the central solar system. At intervals they send their space fighter commands to terminate the human battle fleet", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hannes Sommer", "publishers": "Markt & Technik", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZSne-59pyA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/122680-moons\n"}
