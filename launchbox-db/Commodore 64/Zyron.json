{"altername_name": [], "name": "Zyron", "overview": "Zyron is a top-down vertically-scrolling shooter set on four alien planets and it incorporates some pseudo 3D elements. The player can steer the ship left and right, and he can also control the forward speed, even bringing everything to a halt. There are enemies on the ground, such as tanks and turrets, and planes in the air. There are also hazards such as electrical currents that need to be avoided. To leave the planet the KEY icons on the right side of the screen need to be gathered to form a sequence. This is done by landing in bunkers marked with an I, which contains information about the planet. At the end of the stage four bunkers are shown and the player needs to choose the one that matches the key sequence to exit. Along the way there are also regular bunkers that repair the ship. Not every enemy hit is lethal, it fills up a damage bar on the right side of the screen. The player starts with three lives. The game can be played with up to eight players, taking turns.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Henrik Wening", "publishers": "Kingsoft", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "8", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VenkMtwCs7Y", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/124141-zyron\n"}
