{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mopper", "overview": "You are the janitor in the worst school possible. You must clean the whole school in sections while being attacked by pupils, teachers and even dogs. To top it all off you've got a bad back which gets worse the more you clean. When your back finally goes then you'll have to spend a week to recover. Never fear though, you have weapons at her disposal like soap which can be thrown or a smart-bomb type substance called Gleamo - which kills and cleans everything in sight. The more you clean the more moola you make. The game is viewed from above and is a multi-directional game. You control mopper and each section must be cleaned and a certain amount of enemies have to be killed to progress. All this has to be done within a time limit which is based on your bad back. The more that is cleaned, the more money you earn. You also need to keep your bucket full as well and if nearly empty you have to find places to fill it back up.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Pal Developments", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/122683-mopper\n"}
