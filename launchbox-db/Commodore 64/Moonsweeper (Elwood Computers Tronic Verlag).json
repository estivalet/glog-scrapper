{"altername_name": [], "name": "Moonsweeper (Elwood Computers/Tronic Verlag)", "overview": "A game by Thomas and published in Computronic 1985/11-12. A 3D game with all the trimmings! You find yourself on a dangerous space patrol. The background moves really three-dimensionally. The game takes you to the moon Lima, better known as \"Moon\" you will fly patrol with your super modern space glider. On your way across the surface of the moon you will encounter strong fleets of \"aliens\" who will give you quite a bit of trouble. They say: \"Escape or shoot down the enemy spaceships!\" Another kind of \"source of danger\" are the laser towers, which suddenly emit deadly lasers - either to the left or to the right (you have to wait and then dodge). There are also true kamikaze UFOs and mother ships emerging from space, the Make them really hard, so fire from all guns to escape this hell relatively unscathed! You go through several rounds during the (successful) game. The change of rounds is made clear by the different color of the lunar surface. You have to survive five rounds in total, with rounds 4 and 5 featuring significantly faster attackers. Of course, there are points for every goal, and after the game you can \"immortalize\" your glorious name in the Hi-Score table. But note: you lose energy every time you collide with the enemy or if you come into contact with the lasers. This decreases accordingly until you have breathed your \"moon life\" last breath.
