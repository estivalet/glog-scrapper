{"altername_name": [], "name": "Qewb", "overview": "Jigsaw puzzles have entertained people for decades, but there's one problem with them: Once you've completed a puzzle, you must either undo your work and start over or get a new puzzle. Qewb is an animated electronic jigsaw puzzle that solves this problem once and for all. With its revolving game board, rotating pieces, and multiple difficulty levels, Qewb provides an unlimited number of puzzles in a single package. The object of Qewb is to position as many pieces on the board as possible. In order to do this, you must place the pieces next to one another without leaving gaps. On the lower levels, the pieces arc simple and fit together easily. Later, they become more complex and are more difficult to position.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "February 5, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Robert Bixby", "publishers": "COMPUTE!
