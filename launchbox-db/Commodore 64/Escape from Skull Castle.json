The elements had eaten away at the huge entrance door until it resembled a skull, and the building itself was often referred to as Skull Castle. Once in a while someone would take a walk up to the aging structure to look around. Usually this person would never be heard of again Some actually claim to have heard music and the sound of dancing coming from the \"castle.\" One stormy day you decide that you can stand the mystery no longer. You take a walk to Skull Castle and decide to go inside. What you see is astounding. Skulls and skeletons are flying around everywhere. You hear voices. The people that were never heard from are calling you for help.
