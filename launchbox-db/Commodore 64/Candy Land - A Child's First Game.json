{"altername_name": ["Candyland"], "name": "Candy Land: A Child's First Game", "overview": "\"Once upon a time, King Kandy, the Imperial Head Bonbon and Grand Jujube of Candy Land disappeared.\" Thus begins the magical journey of Milton Bradley's classic Candy Land board game. Captivated by the story of a kidnapped king and eager to help find him, little ones move their gingerbread pawns along a rainbow path and through a land of candy characters, all subjects of King Kandy's realm.There are occasional pitfalls: land on the wrong square and you might be stuck in Molasses Swamp for a time. With all these enticing, sugarcoated images (and King Kandy plainly visible at path's end), children can't help but be delighted by Candy Land. It's delicious!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Michael Robert Hausman", "publishers": "GameTek", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75506-candy-land-a-childs-first-game\n"}
