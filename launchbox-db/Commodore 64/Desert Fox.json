{"altername_name": [], "name": "Desert Fox", "overview": "Desert Fox is a strategy/action mix set in World War II. The player takes the role of tank commander Lone Wolf who has to foil the Rommel's plans in Northern Africa. The strategic part of the game plays on a overhead map which shows Lone Wolf and Rommel's positions. The overall goal is to save the Allied depots which are attacked by Rommel's troops - the main challenge is to save all of them in time. Lone Wolf can be moved over the map and one airstrike per game can be used to buy time for one depot. Lone Wolf also has the ability to gain enemy intel with his radio - this is useful in order to find out where obstacles await. Whenever Lone Wolf runs into one of these obstacles or Rommel, one of five action sequences starts. This includes tank duels, a turret section against incoming fighters, navigating a minefield, protecting a convoy and escaping an ambush. Those action sequences can also be played separately from the campaign. Lighting conditions change depending on the time of day.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sydney Development Corp.", "publishers": "Avantage Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.24", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert_Fox_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIIinFG6XOo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/95772-desert-fox\n"}
