{"altername_name": ["IFR"], "name": "IFR: Flight Simulator", "overview": "IFR is a flight simulator of Cessna 172RG Cutlass light aircraft. Due to limitations of early 1980s computers it doesn't offer external cockpit view, only an instrument panel (hence the name: Instrument Flight Rules) with full set of gauges: altimeter, tachometer, artificial horizon, airspeed, turn, and rate of climb indicators. The plane is also equipped with flaps, retractable landing gear, LORAN-C inertial navigation system, ILS and ADF (picking up 4 beacons and 2 airfields on the map). The objective is to safely navigate between 4 airfields located on the map, while avoiding terrain obstacles etc. and within the aircraft fuel limit (~30 min.); the game flight model also includes stalls, wind and turbulence (difficulty level is adjustable).", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ron Wanttaja", "publishers": "Academy Software", "genres": "Flight Simulator", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/105997-ifr-flight-simulator\n"}
