Try to hit the letters, blocks and stars. In this way you can build up bonuses and keep the playing field constantly changing. It is possible to have 2 balls on the field at the same time.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Joe Kowalski", "publishers": "Eurosoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/121667-pinball-blaster\n"}
