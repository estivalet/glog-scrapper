{"altername_name": [], "name": "Escape from the East", "overview": "Can you fly over the border in your balloon and escape from the east? The object of this game is to find way across the sky, making sure not to hit a mine or crash into a fighter or helicopter, then exit on the right side of the screen. You must be high in the sky at this point or you will likely crash. Completing each screen moves you on to a harder one, until finally you safely guide your balloon over the border fence. You then have the task of maneuvering your balloon down a volcano, avoiding the clouds of volcanic gas.
