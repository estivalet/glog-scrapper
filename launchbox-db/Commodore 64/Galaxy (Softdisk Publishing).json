{"altername_name": [], "name": "Galaxy (Softdisk Publishing)", "overview": "A strategy game for two to four players created by Jason Anderson and released in 1992 in Loadstar #095. War in space is not necessarily frantic. Sometimes it takes forethought and strategy to protect your mother-ship and fleet. This game is for two to four players. The game focuses on five major types of ships. The Mothership, a base of operations. If this is destroyed that player is out of the game. The Battlestar is a huge destroying machine that is definitely not shaped like a big red yo-yo. The Cruiser is a medium range battleship and similarities between it and NCC-1701 are purely coincidental. The Fighter is a swift and powerful attack ship. Last is the scout, it sacrifices speed for arms and armor. Each vehicle has 5 characteristics. Damage points (DP) are the amount of damage that can be hit before destruction at zero. Points tells how many units of energy are required to build. Attack Percentage is the odds of hitting a target, or accuracy. Speed is how many space it can move a turn and Damage is how many DPs are deducted from a ship when hit. 2-4 players can run this simulation and each will take turns when the inevitable intergalactic war breaks out.
