{"altername_name": ["Stronghold"], "name": "Nucleus", "overview": "A Space Invaders style shoot'em up. Published in Italy as Stronghold in Formula 64 n.48. You have a small ship, from which it is possible to develop a considerable volume of fire with the weapons at your disposal. It can move and dodge horizontally to the left and right. From above come the threats made up of seven different types of attackers. By firing at these adversaries you will first need to take out their defenses. If the aliens reach the surface then we are doomed and you'll have lost your life. Lives lost to cannon fire can regenerate a few times, but touching the earth is a final ending.
