{"altername_name": [], "name": "Electra", "overview": "A Uridium influenced horizontal shooter created by Ronald Mayer and published in Magic Disk 64 1989/12. The aim of the game is to remove radioactive crystals from platforms lying on different stars. The total of 48 crystals of a level have to be picked up by spaceship (just fly over the crystals!), Before you can fly to the runway at the right end of the platform. You can recognize the runway by the label \"LAND HERE\". Of course, there are also hosts of extraterrestrials again, whose cleanliness trip goes really against the grain. That is why they attack your spaceship in 8 formations. While you can easily cut your way through enemy ranks with your laser weapons, be careful with the rest of the obstacles: walls, missiles, and individual aliens cannot be destroyed.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ronald Mayer", "publishers": "CP Verlag", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASYChaluY8Y", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/98164-electra\n"}
