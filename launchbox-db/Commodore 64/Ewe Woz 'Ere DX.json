{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ewe Woz 'Ere DX", "overview": "In this deluxe version of the game we follow Baaary: Mutton Commando is a cyborg sheep from the distant future who must preserve the future of mutton-kind by defending the fields from an invasion of Traazkists led by the evil combat lizard, Traazk. Armed with a basic plasma spitter, Baaary is teleported into the field where he must destroy meanies and collect charges to prime the gateway and clear the level. Shoot the aliens and collect the bonuses which are dropped when they are destroyed in order to progress to the next level! The goal of each level is to open a gateway by collecting charges which are dropped by the aliens when they are destroyed. When enough charges have been collected, as seen by the charge bar in the status display, it will open somewhere on the level. The gateway remains open for a limited amount of time before closing again. Baaary must find it and pass through to destroy all of the aliens and exit the level before the timer expires. The time to find the gateway is short but can be increased by collecting time bonuses. If the gateway closes, it must be re-opened by collecting charges again. Destroying a meanie might cause it to drop an item or upgrade.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2021", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Chris Page", "publishers": "Bitmap Soft", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/169672-ewe-woz-ere-dx\n"}
