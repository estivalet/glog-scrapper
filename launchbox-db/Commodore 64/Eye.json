{"altername_name": [], "name": "Eye", "overview": "Eye is closely based on the board game with the same name. The game is played with two to four players on a board with differently coloured squares. Each player has playing stones of one colour and the goal to get a certain amount of the own stones on the corresponding fields. The spin on this concept is that the board is placed on two rotatable spirals which change the square distribution on the field when used. During each turn, a player has a different amount of moves available (changes depending on the current match situation); each move consisting of moving a square or turning a spiral. This computer version also allows some rule modifications in comparison to the original game and all opponents can be replaced by the AI.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Cascade Games", "publishers": "Endurance Games", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/100006-eye\n"}
