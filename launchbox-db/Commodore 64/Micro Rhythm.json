{"altername_name": ["MicroRhythm"], "name": "Micro Rhythm", "overview": "MicroRhythm was part of a set of music creation software (then advertised as games) that used real sampled sounds and was essentially a drum-machine. It features three modes: 'BARS' mode was used to create individual patterns and 'SONG' mode to align patterns in desired order to create a tune (exactly as pattern-based music sequencers do). There was also a third Real-Time mode for playing with the keyboard. Simple flam effect and pitch adjust for every sample were also possible, as well as the main tempo change.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Simon Pick", "publishers": "Firebird Software", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "0.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRhythm", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxChHw_s8m0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/108880-micro-rhythm\n"}
