Instead of ordinary weapons they deploy biological orbs that will cause devastation on Earth if they reach critical mass! Take your time, plan ahead, this is a matching game where nothing happens until you make a move! Bring a friend to tackle the infestation from the other end. Just don\u2019t let the orbs reach critical mass! Two players work together to match 3 orbs of the same color.
