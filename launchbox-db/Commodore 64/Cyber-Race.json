{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cyber-Race", "overview": "Vs. Racing, split screen style published in 64'er 1992/09. With Cyber-Race every computer room becomes a race track. As a couple you can whiz down the slopes in the racing car and experience the inimitable feeling of the Formula I. You have to cover as large a distance as possible within a given time. If you run into your opponent, he will get a push, while you will be slowed down. The car also brakes very hard when leaving the lane. The screen is split, with the player using the joystick in port 2 controlling the upper car. Port 1 controlling the lower car. Only when both drivers are ready, press both fire buttons simultaneously, and the race will begin. The car is steered over the roadway with the left/right joystick. Pushing the joystick forward accelerates the vehicle, while pulling the joystick backward decelerates the vehicle. The yellow score display counts the distance covered by the vehicle above, the red that of the vehicle below.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Maik Qualmann", "publishers": "Markt & Technik", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/95428-cyber-race\n"}
