{"altername_name": [], "name": "Stacker", "overview": "In Stacker, your task is to build a tower, as tall as possible. At the beginning, you're facing an empty playing field; a block made of three squares will be moving left and right. By pressing Space, you can freeze it in its tracks; another block will then appear over it, moving left and right too. Again, you should freeze it, but you should do it when it is over the first block. If you miss it completely, you lose! If you hit it only partially, it will still get added to the tower, but the subsequent blocks will be only 2 or 1 squares long. As play progresses, the blocks move faster and faster, and it gets harder and harder to stop them at the right moment.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dustin Chambers", "publishers": "Retro64 Inc.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/130120-stacker\n"}
