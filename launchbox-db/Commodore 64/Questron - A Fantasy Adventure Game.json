Everything is represented by tile graphics: towns, monsters, trees, hills, etc. The sprite that represents the player changes, depending on which mode of transportation is used -- beginning, for instance, on foot. Dungeons in the endgame are done in a three-dimensional first-person style similar to The Bard's Tale.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Charles 'Chuck' Dougherty", "publishers": "All American Adventures", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questron", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/QPhOHr1Ab2E", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72083-questron-a-fantasy-adventure-game\n"}
