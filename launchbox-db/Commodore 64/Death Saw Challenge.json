{"altername_name": [], "name": "Death Saw Challenge", "overview": "Just in time for Halloween 2020 comes Death Saw Challenge... You play the role of Fuzzi, a cute blue creature. You have been thrown into a deadly dungeon. You are not alone. You have company ... Aah, how nice and wonderful ... Well, it is not really that nice. Death saws appear from nowhere and they are out to get you. Your task is to guide Fuzzi around the dungeon and help him survive for as long as he can before getting diced up by a death saw. Before a saw appears an alarm will alert you. Every time a saw appears, you are automatically protected for a few seconds. Staying idle will not award you any points and gives you a higher risk of death. So don't be idle. YOU MUST MOVE OUT THE WAY AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE. The game will start easy with 1 death saw per 15 seconds. Then 15 seconds after 7 death saws appear ... Ooer!!! How long can you survive the DEATH SAW CHALLENGE!?!?!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "October 31, 2020", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Richard Bayliss", "publishers": "The New Dimension (TND)", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_Erf7VzO-k", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/143147-death-saw-challenge\n"}
