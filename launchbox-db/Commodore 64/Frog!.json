{"altername_name": ["La Rana Stregata"], "name": "Frog!", "overview": "In this game, the player controls a frog who must eat bugs to survive. This can be done by using the 1-9 keys to control the frog's mouth and width of his tongue. The farther he has to reach, the more energy he uses. There are ten skill levels. The higher the skill level, the faster the bugs will travel and the more energy the frog consumes. The game is over when the frog loses all its energy.
