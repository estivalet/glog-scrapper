{"altername_name": [], "name": "Turn It 2: Future Edition", "overview": "Turn It 2: Future Edition is a Shanghai variant. The player has to remove the tiles with the same marks from the board until all the board is completely empty. The elimination of tiles is allowed if these tiles are projected on the same line with no other tiles in their projection path. There are a certain number of same items on each level. The player can mark the tiles, or cancel the action to change the decision. The dead-ends exist if the strategy of tiles elimination was incorrect. Games are time-limited and a certain number of 'next move' suggestions are available during gameplay.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Amok Developments", "publishers": "Kingsoft", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/76146-turn-it-2-future-edition\n"}
