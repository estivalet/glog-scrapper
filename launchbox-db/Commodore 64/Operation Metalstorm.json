{"altername_name": [], "name": "Operation Metalstorm", "overview": "Operation Metalstorm, designed by Alf Yngve with music and additional coding by Richard Bayliss, is a tribute to the 90s arcade game Terminator 2: Judgement Day and features plenty of robot blasting action. The backstory to Operation Metalstorm is that us naive humans thought we could create an intelligent Robot population that would look after all of our needs, creating a world paradise with no war or poverty. Well, unfortunately the Robots don\u2019t believe in the notion of \u2018make love not war\u2019 and have banded together with the aim of wiping out human civilisation. Now its up to you, the best of the best, to stop them by finding the master computer and destroy it into smithereens. The World\u2019s fate lies in your hands.
