{"altername_name": [], "name": "Translogic", "overview": "A logic based puzzle game developed by Cream Software and published by CP Verlag in Magic Disk 64 1992/11. In this game a lot of brainpower is required. In addition, you have to prove yourself to be a true joystick acrobat in order to be able to adhere to the really tight time limits. The aim of the game is to bring order into a completely disorganized ball system. For this reason, the screen is also split in half. The left side represents the desired side and the right side the actual chaos. With the cursor you can now try to move the balls so that both sides are identical. When this is done, a quick press of the space button is enough to get to the next level. In addition, the status line at the top of the screen provides constant information on the most important data. Above all, you should keep an eye on the time limit and act accordingly.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Cream Software", "publishers": "CP Verlag", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133804-translogic\n"}
