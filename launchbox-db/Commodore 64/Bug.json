{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bug", "overview": "An action game by James Hall , published in 64 Tape Computing No. 07 (1985/xx). The story so far: One day sid is typing iin a 64k program out of a magazine into his Commodore 64. At long last he reaches the final line of code. He sighs, crosses his fingers and hits the return key. All of a sudden his computer goes mad, printing random number and letters all over the screen (this is not unusual for the CBM) until it finally stops and goes to a blank screen. Sid is thumping mad and begins to do just that, thumping and bashing his CBM demanding his program and his time back. A sudden beam of intense light shoots from the computer and hits Sid, engulfing him in glory. When the beam fades, Sid is gone. Now inside his CBM, he is escorted by 2 huge space invaders to the main CPU. There he is questioned and ordered to play against the bug which destroyed the program. Sid chooses Pac-Man, they are escorted to the grey playing area and the rules are set. The Rules: If you try to hide behind anything the bug is allowed to climb over. The bug can hide in microchips and jump out at you. Once you have eaten all the oxygen pills a door opens at the top of the screen. If you have done well the game lords may free you, or give you another screen to play.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "James Hall", "publishers": "Argus Press Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90136-bug\n"}
