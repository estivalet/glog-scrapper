{"altername_name": [], "name": "Domino Logic (Version 2)", "overview": "An updated/improved version of the Domino Logic game that came on Loadstar #61. This one was released ten years later on Loadstar #175. Both versions were developed by Dave Johannsen. An ingenious but updated random puzzle that dares you to divide a grid of dots into dominoes. Multiple level selections allow you to make this as easy or difficult as you want. Joystick and keyboard controls, color and font controls and an undo command round out the features. The new version allows it to work from any drive, having it all in one file, and updated and improved font selections.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dave Johannsen", "publishers": "J & F Publishing, Inc.", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147220-domino-logic-version-2\n"}
