Published in Italy as Robot Assalter in both Super C64 e C128 n.41 (gennaio 1990) and Supplementi Edigamma/pubblirome - 30 games esclusivi (1990). A brilliant 14th century inventor created a truly futuristic machine: the Robot. A jealous chrono-magician, however, became aware of the thing and took the first prototypes by locking them in his castle. The inventor then created an assault robot to rescue the first specimens. In this game, you control the robot and need to help him carry out his mission. Press F7 to start the game. You find yourself on the walls of the castle where a thousand difficulties await you: traps, chasms, arrows, various beings, all of whom are very dangerous and to be avoided absolutely. After passing a few pictures, you will reach a captive robot that you will have to rescue. You must continue like this until all the robots have been recovered.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Oliver Musolf", "publishers": "Multisoft", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/132650-time-res-q\n"}
