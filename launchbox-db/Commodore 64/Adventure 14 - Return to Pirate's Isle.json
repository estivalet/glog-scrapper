{"altername_name": [], "name": "Adventure 14: Return to Pirate's Isle", "overview": "Adventure 14: Return to Pirate's Isle is an unofficial source code hack of the old Scott Adams' game of the same name. The original game was only released on the Texas Instruments TI-99/4A, but in late 2019 someone used a Z-Code website to convert the game to make it runnable on the C64. This was the sequel to Pirate Cove/Pirate Adventure. Desciption; Created exclusively for the TI, Return to Pirate's Isle was the only Scott Adams adventure which did NOT require the TI Adventure cartridge, available separately. It is still subject to debate whether this is truly #14 in the series or whether it does not count since it was only made for the TI. It uses the same parser and interface as the other games in the series, and challenges you to return to Pirate's Isle in search of treasure yet again. You may want to speed up the emulation, as the game does run a bit slow compared to the original Texas Instruments version.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2019", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Scott Adams", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/153676-adventure-14-return-to-pirates-isle\n"}
