{"altername_name": [], "name": "Jungle Story", "overview": "Jungle Story is a side view horizontal scrolling game where you move Mowgli around the bottom half of the screen, avoiding animals and spears over various levels while the screen scrolls constantly from left to right. The spears appear from the left of the screen while the animals which are elephants and snakes appear from the right and they have to be avoided or you lose one of three lives. Moneys also make an appearance in the trees above and drop coconuts and these also need avoiding. To move off a level you have to kill five tigers that run across the screen very fast by throwing pots of fire to kill them.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Mastertronic Ltd.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/107334-jungle-story\n"}
