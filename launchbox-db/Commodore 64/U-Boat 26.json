{"altername_name": [], "name": "U-Boat 26", "overview": "Published in COMPUTE! 1983/11 (Issue #42), and later in COMPUTE!'s Gazette 1994/11, this game starts out quietly enough, but don't be lulled into a false sense of security. Without warning, you'll be called upon to user all your wits to save yourself and your U-Boat crew. The object of the game is to sink as many enemy ships as possible before the depth charges reach you. You can destroy bothersome mines with your torpedoes, but new ones always replace them once a handful of ships have been sunk.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mark Vittek", "publishers": "COMPUTE!
