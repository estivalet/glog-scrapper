{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ice Titans", "overview": "Ice Titans is a shooter for the C64 that is somewhat loosely inspired by Jeff Minter's Laser Zone, albeit scaled down. Ice Titans is the game to play if you're looking for a real break out. The gameplay is simple and easy to figure out: shoot everything that moves. During your expedition into the eternal ice, you woke up a couple of the natives of the same. And they're not exactly happy about your intrusion. You control the two cannons with the joystick in port 2 . If you get caught, the game starts again. Otherwise you can advance to the next higher and therefore more difficult level. It was developed by Cleveland M. Blakemore and originally published in Ahoy! 1988/01 (Issue #49), but was later published in Magic Disk 64 1988/08.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Cleveland M.
