{"altername_name": [], "name": "Risers & Sliders", "overview": "A 50 level Lode-Runner style platform game by David Lightner published in 1994 and in Loadstar #134. Find your way through the mazes picking up diamonds as you go. After all of the diamonds have been collected you will move to a new maze. At the end of each level you will receive bonus points depending on how well you did and how many attempts it took to finish the maze. Transporters are available as well as risers\\elevators and sliders, and combo Slisers that both rise and slide. Watch the clock, you have 5 minutes per maze. Fall too far and you will perish. Keep an eye out for moths, they are deadly and can only be killed by smashing them with a transporter. You can move the transporter by placing your man above it while pressing fire and directing it with a joystick. Free lives can be earned by scoring 200 or more points or killing 12 moths. Levels appear in random order.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "David Lightner", "publishers": "JDB Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/367811-risers-sliders\n"}
