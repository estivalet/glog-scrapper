{"altername_name": ["Skull and Crossbones"], "name": "Skull & Crossbones", "overview": "Fight as either Red Beard or One Eye through various pirate themed levels, like ships and forts, and even some non-pirate themed levels, battling ninjas, skeletons, and others in a quest to get back your hard earned money from an evil wizard. You can also fight side by side with a friend (who controls the pirate you didn't choose). Fighting works like fencing, with a few different moves to use, including parrying. The levels scroll through with a boss at the end of each. You gain money by vanquishing foes and digging for treasure where X marks the spot.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Walking Circles", "publishers": "Domark Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_%26_Crossbones", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dWTHjncTc0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/112332-skull-crossbones\n"}
