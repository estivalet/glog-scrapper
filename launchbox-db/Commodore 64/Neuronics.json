{"altername_name": [], "name": "Neuronics", "overview": "Neuronics is a tile-matching puzzle game with similarities to Swap: The player is presented with a number of tiles with different symbols and colors. If two or more identical tiles are next to each other (diagonally does not count), they disappear. To make this happen, the player can swap two adjacent tiles. However, there is a time limit to consider and empty places left behind by removed tiles are not usable. The goal is to clear the whole field.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Thalion Software GmbH", "publishers": "Art Edition", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibo0QcSgq94", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/110712-neuronics\n"}
