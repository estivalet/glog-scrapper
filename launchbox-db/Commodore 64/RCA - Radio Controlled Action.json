{"altername_name": ["Radio Controlled Action", "Azione Radiocomandata"], "name": "RCA: Radio Controlled Action", "overview": "In this game you must \"control\" a nimble AC racing car that is busy on a path full of other computer-controlled vehicles looking for a head-on collision to destroy your car. It is useless to underline the need to have excellent reflexes as the opponents' movements are very fast and sudden and will even feint at your vehicle to throw you off. So your work is to try to get to the finish line unharmed, for at most you can collide with 3 other cars. Bonus items will appear to help you from time to time. They can give you more points or special abilities such as greater speed, or a higher jump. Published in Italy as Azione Radiocomandata in Game 2000 Nuova serie n.19 (luglio/agosto 1989) and as Azione Radioc in Supplementi Edigamma/pubblirome - commodore plus (1989).", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ramon van der Laar", "publishers": "Golden Eagle", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.edicola8bit.com/riviste/game_2000_nuova_serie/c64/preview/azione_radiocomandata.webm", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/125347-rca-radio-controlled-action\n"}
