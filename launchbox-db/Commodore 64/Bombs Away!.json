{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bombs Away!", "overview": "Bombs Away! seems like a very simple Kaboom! clone. A mad arsonist prowls the top of a building, armed with bombs and dynamite sticks. You are equipped with buckets of water which you must use to catch and extinguish the bombs. As I said, it seems very simple\u2014 but before you know it the bombs are dropping at a rate of about 15 per second. You start the game with three buckets of water. You move them back and forth via a joystick plugged into Port 2. If you miss a bomb, it will of course explode, and it will cost you one of your buckets. Each consecutive level features more bombs and faster action. Also, the higher the level, the more points each bomb is worth. The game ends when you've lost all three buckets. A high score is kept. You'll need to be very quick to do well.
