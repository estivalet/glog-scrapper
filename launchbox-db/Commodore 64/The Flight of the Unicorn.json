{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Flight of the Unicorn", "overview": "A long time ago, in a land far away... The old king lies dying. For many years he has ruled this land wisely and well. Now, the time has come for the crown to pass on. You are his son, the gallant Prince Damien, and the rightful heir to the throne. However, you have competition for the kingdom in the form of your sister, the evil princess Yssylda. The ambitious Yssylda, learning of your love for the king's beautiful witch Corrane, and inflamed by jealousy over your happiness together, has abducted the witch and hidden her away. Unfortunately, this allowed her to steal some of the witch's spells, one particularly nasty one of which she caught you with one night while you were sleeping. The spell transforms you into a Frog without warning, and (as Yssylda can testify) at the most awkward moments. As you care little for the trappings of wealth, you had planned merely to leave the kingdom of your own accord and start a new life somewhere with the beautiful witch Corrane as your wife. This is, however, unknown to the evil Princess Yssylda (who, if she ever listened to a word you said, could have saved herself a lot of trouble) and therefore you must free the witch yourself and escape to freedom with her. To aid you, you may enlist the aid of Corrane's mystical familiar, a cross of Pegasus and Unicorn - a fabulous winged and horned horse born out of mist and magic. Be warned that its friendship is not easily gained.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jeff Tullin", "publishers": "Flight 19 Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/101234-the-flight-of-the-unicorn\n"}
