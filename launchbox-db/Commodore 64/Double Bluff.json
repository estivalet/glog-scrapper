{"altername_name": ["Knees Calhoon's Double Bluff"], "name": "Double Bluff", "overview": "Double Bluff is a 1999 dice gambling game for one player. Development is attributed to Knees Calhoon and published in Loadstar #181. Double Bluff is a bit of fluff, this very simple betting game has some new cards and a small challenge to it. The dealer, draws a card randomly from a 52-card deck and bets you either $1 or $5 that it's a face card (J,Q,K) and you either fold, bet or double the bet. The card is flipped and if it is a face card you pay double what was bet, if not a face card you get paid double.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Knees Calhoon", "publishers": "J & F Publishing, Inc.", "genres": "Casino", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/97318-double-bluff\n"}
