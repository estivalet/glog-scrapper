{"altername_name": [], "name": "Calhoon's Chile Challenge", "overview": "Strategy puzzle game credited to Knees Calhoon and published in the 10th anniversary Loadstar #120. Just one of the 12 chili peppers you use in your morning huevos rancheros has been getting spiked by the other other tenants of Loadstar Tower. You are told you can tell the difference by weighing the fruit. Fender says you should be able to tell which one was spiked by weighing just 3 times, maximum to find the odd one and whether it is light, or heavier than the rest. Use the balance scale, the bins and the 12 peppers and see if you can do it in just 3 tries!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Knees Calhoon", "publishers": "Softdisk Publishing, Inc.", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90253-calhoons-chile-challenge\n"}
