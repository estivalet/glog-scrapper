As the poem in the instructions sheet explains, the only way to put things right is to capture a lock of her hair, then take it to the cauldron and cast a spell to undo things. Controlling the pumpkin is difficult at first, as it has a very high bounce, the exact level of which can be toggled using the 5 key. Direction can only be changed when the ball is on the ground. Ricocheting into enemies costs energy, and you only gain weaponry by landing into magic pools. The starting positions are random, making mapping advisable and increasing the initial challenge. Even then, enemies respawn quickly, so all you're doing is buying a little time to pass them. Others can't be shot, and must be passed by possessing the right object - possibly one of the 5 you will ultimately need to vanquish the witch.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "January 1, 1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "The RamJam Corporation", "publishers": "Palace Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.39", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauldron_II:_The_Pumpkin_Strikes_Back", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bQmK1L1vV4&list=PL5lYNeYYFvgg9wbo8R40mZAl3xFnVcLGo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/34264-cauldron-ii-the-pumpkin-strikes-back\n"}
