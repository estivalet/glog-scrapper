{"altername_name": [], "name": "Superleague Soccer", "overview": "In Superleague Soccer you manage a first division team right from the start, but as your fans demand success - relegation, and you are out! As manager, you must buy and sell players, negotiating for contracts, train reserves and pick your team. But at the end of the day, it's the match that counts - and that's where Superleague Soccer really comes into its own! A revolutionary new control system allows you to control all your players in every match, unlike any other football management game. Other major advances include over a dozen key statistics for every player for added realism. Superleague soccer is a PLATO strategy game so you can rely on top quality presentation throughout and many hours of challenging fun!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "David Kirby", "publishers": "Impressions", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113395-superleague-soccer\n"}
