{"altername_name": [], "name": "Street Cred Football", "overview": "Removing the corporate poshness and ambition of modern football, this Players title gives you a basic street match for one or two human players. Hitting the crate which is used to represent a goal more times than the opponent to win is the only rule. Your team of 5 players is selected from a pool of 24, including representations of the programmers as well as Joe Blade and other Players characters, and these can be placed at will around the pitch. Once in play you control the player nearest the ball, with full passing and shooting control available. Dirty challenges are not only permitted but encouraged.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ian Jones", "publishers": "EDOS", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_Cred_Football", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCkrsxJRQgQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113160-street-cred-football\n"}
