{"altername_name": ["Days", "L'Eridita Contesa"], "name": "The Inheritance", "overview": "Due to an unfortunate accident, you have lost your memory and now you are in the position of having to acquire all your cultural baggage all over again. You will therefore have to travel the world in search of those notions you have forgotten and those people who are dear to you and who will help you in the search for your past. Remember that you can choose whether to impersonate a man or a woman and to change the character you will have to push the joystick upwards. To change direction, instead, without moving the joystick, press the fire button and then choose the direction of travel. Good luck finding your lost inheritance.
