{"altername_name": ["John Anderson's Rally Speedway"], "name": "Rally Speedway", "overview": "Rally Speedway is a conversion with expansions (improved graphics and track editor) of the racing game with the same name for the Mattel Intellivision console. The physics of driving have been programmed very well for the possibilities at that time and the options for adjusting are diverse. But the special thing in this game is the two-player-mode. There is no split screen as in Pitstop II, but both racing cars are in the same screen. If a car now falls back so far - be it through a crash or slower driving - that the distance between the two racing cars is greater than the size of the screen, the race will be interrupted, the driver who had fallen back will get a penalty, both cars are set up next to each other again and the race is continued at the current points. Another interesting detail is, that you can force each other from the street. If the six tracks built into the game are not enough, one can design some more with the track editor and also save them on disk (24 tracks per disk).", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "John Anderson", "publishers": "Adventure International", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.02", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rally_Speedway", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ5DnNbSC60", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/63025-rally-speedway\n"}
