{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pathwords", "overview": "Pathwords is a word game for one to four players where you have to make as many words as you can on a 109 diamond shaped letter grid. Starting on different sides of the diamond, each player takes it in turns to make a word from the letters by moving in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal direction within a chosen time limit. Once a word has been made then the letters are replaced by new letters except the last letter and this is the starting letter for the players next turn. Points are awarded for how many letters and which letters are used with Z and Q scoring high. Once a game has been completed then the players words are shown and their final score, with the winner being the player with the highest score.
