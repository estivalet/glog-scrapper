{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pipeline Run", "overview": "An \"Oil's Well\" clone created by J\u00f6rg Sieslack and published in Magic Disk 64 1990/12. From the tunnel entrance, the pipeline can be moved along the aisles using a joystick, collecting the many oil points. When the fire button is pressed, the pipeline is brought in piece by piece, i.e. it moves back towards the conveyor tower as long as the joystick button is held down. Danger looms from the elements already mentioned that cross the underground tunnel system. If such an object moves towards the pipeline and touches it, a life is forfeited. So it is advisable to eat the villains before contact. Of course, this only works with the head of the pipeline. You should (as is actually the case in our culture, unless you eat at McDonald 's) take your time as the pipeline also wants to digest the boys. If you refrain from lingering briefly on the spot, it can well happen that an overload will paralyze the device. Aim to collect all oil points on the field. The player also plays against the clock. If this has dropped to 50 units, the upper area of the shaft is refilled with oil points. The time limit increases slightly when a blinking object is eaten. All in all, it is important to vacuum 6 tunnel systems. A pipeline is lost if one of the villains touches it, a villain is eaten too quickly, or the time is up.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "December 7, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "J\u00f6rg Sieslack", "publishers": "CP Verlag", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "0.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cVEK5MZ-cg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/124067-pipeline-run\n"}
