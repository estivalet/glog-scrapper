{"altername_name": ["Fresh Kicker"], "name": "Kicker", "overview": "A Football/Soccer arcade style game for 2 players for head to head competitive play. First published in COMPUTE!'s Gazette 1986/02 (Issue #32), and later in Best of COMPUTE! & Gazette, Digital Marketing PD #146 and by Australia's Street Games as part of the \"Red Pack\". Later it would be re-released as Fresh Kicker by Tiger-Crew PD. There's no such thing as luck in this fast-paced two-player soccer simulation for the Commodore 64 and 128 (in 64 mode). Two joysticks are required. Defense is just as important as offense in \"Kicker,\" a two-player soccer simulation in which each player controls nine men. You need quick reflexes to protect your goal and to drive the ball toward your opponent's goal.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "February 3, 1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "John Krause", "publishers": "COMPUTE!
