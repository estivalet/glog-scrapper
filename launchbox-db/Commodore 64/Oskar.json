After the failure of the nuclear reactor are the insects around have mutated into monsters: killer wasps and cockroaches are the size of cow and they are grabbing up the residents of a small town in New Arizona. Everything flees. Only the farmer Oskar stands between them and those who must flee. Despite fierce resistance from the Spider-City citizens' initiative, the outdated nuclear power plant outside the city gates was not shut down. It happened as it had to happen: During an incident, radioactive waste water escaped and flowed into the Apache River. This was the beginning of the horror in Spider-City: wasps, spiders and beetles mutated into huge monsters due to the uncontrolled radioactivity and attacked people. Only one has the courage to take action against the beasts: Oskar, a farmer from the eastern edge of town. Armed with a lethal injection containing so much highly concentrated \"DDT 5000\" that one could use it to wipe out all the inhabitants of Spider-City in one fell swoop, he goes in search of the nuclear monsters.
