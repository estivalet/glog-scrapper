{"altername_name": [], "name": "Punkt Punkt Punkt", "overview": "The \"famous\", German Sat1 TV show with Mike Kr\u00fcger on the C64 for two players against each other or a player against the computer! You get a sentence (eg POINT..PUNKT..PUNKT makes tired men happy.), Then you have to think about what might happen instead of Punkt..Punkt..Punkt. Here maybe \"beer\" or \"sports show\" would not be wrong. Opposite you are six prominent co-workers who have the same job. There are three points to each match. In two \"crack-point\" rounds you will be presented with two words each having the same initial letters. You now have to guess which of the two words your \"celebrity partner\" chooses. If you were able to prevail against your opponent, you have the opportunity to multiply your score at the point-point-point wheel. If you have enough points after that, you may enter the high score list, which will be stored on diskette.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "PCSL Software GmbH", "genres": "Quiz", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEyrBcWKKPg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/111894-punkt-punkt-punkt\n"}
