{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bureaucracy I", "overview": "This is not the Infocom version of Bureaucracy, that is for the C128 but can be found in the C64 Infocom EasyFlash Collection if you have the EasyFlash hardware. This version was written by David Wasserman in a similar spirit and using the AdventureWriter/Quill software for text adventure creation.
