{"altername_name": [], "name": "Flash Flood", "overview": "It is raining heavily outside your house, and the object of this game is to catch the falling raindrops before they fall down through the roof - depicted by the yellow line - and into the basement below. Once raindrops reach the basement, it starts to fill up with water. When the bucket is nearly full, you need to go to the sink at the right of the roof to empty it. Once you have caught enough raindrops, you proceed to the next level but the water level in the basement remains the same. The game ends if the basement is completely flooded.
