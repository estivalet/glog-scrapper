{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bubble Escape 2K", "overview": "You, a sentient soap bubble, have been arrested for your political beliefs by the ruling class of your society, an ancient race of dragons. You find yourself imprisoned in a maze-like dungeon from which you must escape. There is but a single exit, and it will require five different keys to open. You will find these keys randomly deposited throughout the dungeon, but each room presents its own hazards: moving walls, fireballs, hovering sentry robots, and dragon officials. Being a soap bubble, you must be very careful to avoid touching any of these hazards, and the dungeon walls as well, otherwise you will pop. Fortunately, bubbles, like cats, have nine lives.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2009", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Chris Pressey", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/367875-bubble-escape-2k\n"}
