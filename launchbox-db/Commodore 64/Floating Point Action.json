{"altername_name": ["Boing Going"], "name": "Floating Point Action", "overview": "A breakout style game for one or two-player simultaneous, cooperative play. A wall has been erected between you and freedom from the evil Magniform. Having finally managed to capture you, your arch enemy has locked you in the cellar of his palace and raised a brick cell to prevent your escape. Thankfully, your cunning has no limits and using a paddle you will have to try to demolish the single bricks one by one. It seems your time on the National Ping Pong team may actually end up being useful to you. You will need to bounce the powerful sphere against the wall to be able to open you way, but be careful because although it is not the only weapon at your disposal to escape the wrath of Magniform, once you lose all of them, it will destroy you.
