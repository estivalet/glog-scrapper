{"altername_name": [], "name": "Lethal", "overview": "Lethal is an arcade style action game developed by Quantum Logic Systems and published by Alternative Software Ltd. in 1988. Having recently ejected from your crashing Star Hopper whilst approaching space port on the planet 'Stank', you must complete the rest of the journey on foot. Easy, you might think, but you would be wrong. Stank is a highly unstable planet (it being named after the volcanic fumes - i.e. the planet Stank!) So you must walk along the platforms that have been laid for unfortunates such as you. The planets native inhabitants are not so considerate, attacking you with arrows and blocking your path with 'killer bouncing balls!?!' These can be shot, but only if you have picked up the ammunition which can be found at blocks marked X. Due to a design fault, the weapon will only fire if you jump, so your timing must be spot on. Also you can hold only 10 rounds of ammo at one time. So, basically, jump over lava pools, kill the baddies and get to the space port.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Quantum Logic Systems", "publishers": "Alternative Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASib4SuJ4X0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/110443-lethal\n"}
