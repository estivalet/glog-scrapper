{"altername_name": [], "name": "Omega Force One", "overview": "Prepare for combat action in this horizontally scrolling space shooter published in both 64'er Sonderheft 37 and Digital Marketing PD #163. The game \"Omega Force One\" is a technically perfect program from the genre of \"Shoot'em Up\" games, in which the aim is to destroy the aliens attacking in constantly new formations with your own spaceship and yourself not to be hit: Live and let die. The game idea has certainly often been declared dead, complex games such as role-playing games or action-adventures seemed to supplant the simple concept, but despite all this, these lone fighters in action against foreign powers are not dying out. The version presented here by one of our readers from Denmark prepares the idea with perfectly animated and beautifully drawn sprites as well as good sound effects and melodies.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Claus Petersen", "publishers": "Markt & Technik", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctxbC2l9vK8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/123140-omega-force-one\n"}
