{"altername_name": ["Soccer War: Death Match"], "name": "Soccer War", "overview": "A fun soccer-themed Commodore 64 game. It's been a long time since we made our first game, Black Hole 3D , but we wanted to continue working on new projects taking advantage of the SEUCK development tool. At the time we already thought about making this game, but the idea remained in the pipeline. A year later we have it ready and now we share it with all of you. Whenever we think of a soccer game, we think of the typical match between two teams, but what if we turn the idea around? Well then we have Soccer War. A game with the objective of surviving on the field to defeat your opponent, for this our weapon will be the ball with which we must eliminate everything that comes at us. Soccer War consists of 3 phases (3 fields) and an extra bonus . Each with different conditions and enemies adapted to these. Our protagonist. \u201c Futbolino \u201d, a name that was originally going to be the name of the game, must be overcome to win. Giant balls, fast players, flying chairs, deadly shots, etc., are some of the enemies that we will meet in our advance.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2019", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Chris Yates", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/130618-soccer-war\n"}
