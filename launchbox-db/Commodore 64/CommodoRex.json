{"altername_name": [], "name": "CommodoRex", "overview": "CommodoRex is yet another version of T-Rex, a popular runner that you can play when your Chrome web browser is disconnected from the internet. And doing exactly the opposite was the purpose of this project: to play T-Rex when your C64 is online! With 64NIC+ or WiC64 cartridges attached to your C64 this is possible! But, in case you don't have these cartridges, you still can enjoy playing offline and save your hi-scores to disk or tape. Available on ZZAP! 64 Micro Action Issue #10's cover disk, on the Double Dino compilation cartridge by Bobr Games and as a digital download.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2022", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Commocore", "publishers": "Bobr Games", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/221940-commodorex\n"}
