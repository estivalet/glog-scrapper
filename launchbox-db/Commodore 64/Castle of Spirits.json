{"altername_name": [], "name": "Castle of Spirits", "overview": "Castle of Spirits is a 1988 text adventure by Anthony Maro for the Commodore 64. It was developed by Anthony Maro and published in the following: \u2022 Loadstar #056 \u2022 Digital Talk #003 (26.09.1993) A text adventure intended to help you learn techniques you can use in your own programs. The Castle of Spirits is a small interactive adventure game which has most of the features you're accustomed to in text games. You use verb-noun commands like \"Go House\" or \"Take Box\". If you want to take a two-word noun, such as an oil can take the second word, eg. \"Take Can\". Normal shorthand such as N, S, E, W for the cardinal directions, U and D can be used for up and down. You are in a large courtyard with a dilapidated shed in the corner. The south edge is lined by an old stone wall with a portcullis in the middle. Whilst going about your business a more than slightly deranged apparition appears. He seems to be creaming some nonsense about no escape. The ghost very impolitely laughs in your face and then vanishes to whatever unsightly place he appeared from. You will need to prepare to take on all the horrors a gothic castle can dish out and if you are lucky, you may get out of this castle alive!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Anthony Maro", "publishers": "Softdisk Publishing", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/158232-castle-of-spirits\n"}
