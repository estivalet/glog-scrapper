{"altername_name": [], "name": "Desert Decision", "overview": "Your Computer 1986/02. A fast shoot-em-up game with a strategic touch. Your mission, Sheriff, is to ensure law and order in this monster-safe town and the surrounding desert. But this is difficult as the cacti growing in the desert produce strange alien monsters. So get em while they are still growing bushes and can hardly escape. One cacti doesn't produce a monster but 2 in close proximity will spawn a monster egg. You can't shoot the eggs, only monsters. But beware, when you shoot a monster, they often become cacti! So don't shoot one close to an existing cactus or it is monster egg time, for sure! But there is hope, if you shoot a monster next to 2 cacti, they will often dissappear. The day is completed if there are no bushes, cactus pairs or monsters in the playing areas.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "February 1, 1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Burkhard Meier", "publishers": "Business Press International", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/96423-desert-decision\n"}
