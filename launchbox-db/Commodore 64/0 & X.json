{"altername_name": ["0 and X", "O & X"], "name": "0 & X", "overview": "0 and x is a 3D version of Tic-Tac-Toe or Noughts and Crosses, where you have to make a row of X's in a vertical, horizontal or diagonal line before the computer makes a row. Instead of making a row off three on a 3 x 3 grid you now have to make a row off four on a 4 x 4 grid on four boards so as well as watching for a line on one board, you have to watch out for a row that appears in the same place on all four boards.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Robtek Ltd.", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.12", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86391-0-x\n"}
