{"altername_name": [], "name": "LumberJack Basic", "overview": "For what is a game made in BASIC this version of Lumberjack by Steveboy aka Istv\u00e1n Maros is just as enjoyable as all the other versions and as one person on the CSDb rightly says is very playable. The only critique I could give the game is the response time is a little slow, but then that could be down to the C64 forever emulator i'm using on my other computer. Still other than that, i'd highly recommend C64 owners to give this game a go.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "November 20, 2018", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Steveboy", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/160362-lumberjack-basic\n"}
