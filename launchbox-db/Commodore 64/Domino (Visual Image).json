{"altername_name": ["Dom-Games"], "name": "Domino (Visual Image)", "overview": "With so many action games available, we would certainly do well to engage the brain more with a logic game. The first thing you'll notice at the center of the screen is the timer that counts off the seconds until what could be the end of the level if you don't finish in time. At the top is the place to type, the boxes are where you must place your pawns. To arrange the pieces you have to type the letter corresponding to the piece to be used and the TWO digit number (eg 03 and not just 3!) of the destination square. If you want to use Joker\\Wildcard tokens, which are limited in use per level then write J instead of the letter. To see the pawns D, E and F you have to press the F1, F3 and F5 keys respectively.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Attila Olatos", "publishers": "Edizione Logica 2000", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/96958-domino-visual-image\n"}
