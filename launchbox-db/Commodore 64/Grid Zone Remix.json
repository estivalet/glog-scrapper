{"altername_name": [], "name": "Grid Zone Remix", "overview": "This is Grid Zone, with some new redesigned levels and also additional attack formations, depending on what level the player is at!. Help Ned the dog collect gems, and watch out for those powerful lasers and nasty black holes. Also don't touch that orb. Although it looks harmless, it's deadly. Ned can protect himself (a certain number of times) by releasing a shield (Operated by the Fire button) for a temporary amount of time. You only have a certain limit to use those shields. Nothing lasts forever. Can you break through all 16 levels? The higher the level, the more black holes there are later on in the game.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2005", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Johan Janssen", "publishers": "Cronosoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75886-grid-zone-remix\n"}
