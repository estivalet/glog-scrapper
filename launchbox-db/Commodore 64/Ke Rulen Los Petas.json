{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ke Rulen Los Petas", "overview": "In a dystopian future in Bangkok, drug addicts Mikel Jakson and Andr\u00e9s Kasho Mulo fight against the corrupt dictatorship of the evil General Charoen. A very great Spanish language adventure that perhaps did not have an overwhelming success it should have. Everything is good, from the graphics to the setting, except perhaps the character set.
