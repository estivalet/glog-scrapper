{"altername_name": [], "name": "Kidnapped (RUN)", "overview": "Want to impress your friends? There's no better way than to rescue them from the aliens who've locked them in an underground maze! You can accomplish this amazing task with Kidnapped! The problem is that you only have 2 minutes to save them all because once the aliens detect you the maze will be set to explode. The maze has 7 doors, six open into hiding places and the last, a black one, leading to the outside. Scattered throughout the maze are keys needed to open the doors. Don't touch the alien guards or they will capture you and all will be lost!
