{"altername_name": [], "name": "Stronghold", "overview": "An exploration flick-screen game published in a computer magazine \"Compute!\" and found in Compute!'s Gazette 1991/04. You wander around a planetscape in a spaceship exploring, saving astronauts and finding keys to gates while avoiding crashing to the ground; it's not very \"physics-y\" but you do you drift slowly downward because of gravity, and have to adjust because most wall collisions are fatal. Periodically some screens you enter have a guardian jellyfish thing (shades of Metroid?) that you can dispatch with your unlimited River-Raid style gun.
