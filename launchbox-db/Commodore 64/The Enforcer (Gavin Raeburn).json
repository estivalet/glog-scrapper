{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Enforcer (Gavin Raeburn)", "overview": "In The Enforcer, you play a robot that has to explore and collect parcels over various levels in the Durge Caverns while shooting or avoiding various creatures that roam around each level. The game is a platform game that scrolls in multiple directions when you move the robot and you have to jump or climb ladders to progress. If you touch any creature or deadly object then you lose part of a meter and when this reaches zero then it is game over. All the parcels need to be collected within a time limit and all crosses are checkpoints when you walk over them.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gavin Raeburn", "publishers": "Alpha Omega Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/96416-the-enforcer-gavin-raeburn\n"}
