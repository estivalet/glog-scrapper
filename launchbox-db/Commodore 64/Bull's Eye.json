{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bull's Eye", "overview": "Published in RUN 1990/06-07, this is a head-to-head dart throwing game. You start with a score of 300 and then each hit is deducted from that. Each player gets three darts at a time, alternating with the other player. Eventually you try to get to exactly zero. Only then can you know who is the RULER of the PUB!! And also, who buys the next round. As with all darts games the center is worth 50 points (bull's eye) and the area around it is worth 25. Other areas have assigned values based on difficulty. At the end the fight to get exactly zero can be tough as if your dart scores more than the amount of the original 300 you have left it does not register, to win you must get to exactly zero.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tony Brantner", "publishers": "RUN", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90204-bulls-eye\n"}
