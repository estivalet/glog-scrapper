{"altername_name": [], "name": "Lazer Force", "overview": "Lazer Force allows you to play four versions of classic arcade games over 32 levels. The first level is a top down, vertically scrolling version of Salamander. You have to avoid flames spouting from the wall and shoot the enemies coming down the screen towards you. The second level is a top down view version of Centipede. Shoot the enemies coming down the screen while shooting flying enemies coming towards you. Avoid hitting mushrooms. The third level is a side view version of Moon Cresta. Let your ship fall and steer it to a re-fuelling point. Pressing the fire button gives you boost as you fight gravity pulling you down. Try to land gently. The fourth level is a top down vertically scrolling game. You must steer your ship through a tunnel avoiding the walls. Holding the fire button speeds up your ship giving you a bigger score. Repeat these levels eight times to complete the game.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gavin Raeburn", "publishers": "Codemasters Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wix9aaJdcgI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/89351-lazer-force\n"}
