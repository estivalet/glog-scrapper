{"altername_name": ["Doc Croc's Outrageous Adventures", "Round the Bend!"], "name": "Doc Croc's Outrageous Adventures!: Round the Bend!", "overview": "Kids TV show Round the Bend was set in a fictitious comic factory - one with amazingly even more toilet humor than the real things. In this licensed game Doc Croc has blown up the printing press, and Lou Brush must go through the sewers to retrieve all 8 pages. After selecting a section from the initial screen of pipes, gameplay involves moving through scrolling platform sections in order to reach the sheets. Once this is done each page is played out as a single-screen multi-layered screen. The specific settings are influenced by the TV show, including Doc Croc\u2019s Nursery Crimes, The False Teeth Versus the Atomic Banana, and Kenny McTickle and His Magic Kilt.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "David Sowerby", "publishers": "Impulze", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-9Xe-Z45as", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/116923-doc-crocs-outrageous-adventures-round-the-bend\n"}
