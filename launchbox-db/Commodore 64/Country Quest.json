{"altername_name": [], "name": "Country Quest", "overview": "You are on holiday in the Herefordshire countryside for a week, staying in a farm cottage, sightseeing around the local area as well as talking to the locals. Over the week you have heard many stories about the previous owner who died a month ago from a long illness, who it is believed buried much of his wealth around the area. With no living or known relatives there is no one to ask to confirm this so you take it with a pinch of salt at first. Many of the locals though recall seeing the owner on many nights with a box and spade walking around and so you start to believe and finally decide you will try to find the so called lost wealth. Country Quest is a text adventure where the screen has text describing your location and you type in commands with the keyboard to interact with your surroundings.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Martin Lewis", "publishers": "Wye Valley Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/94149-country-quest\n"}
