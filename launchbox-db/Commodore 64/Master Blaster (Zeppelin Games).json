Blaster"], "name": "Master Blaster (Zeppelin Games)", "overview": "You are the pilot of a Federation Clearance Ship and it's your job to make sure the Space Lanes between Pluto and Mercury are clear from asteroids (reduced in size when shot), alien ships and shooting stars. You must clear three sectors for each planet in the Solar System before attempting to dock with the Factory Ship. The game is viewed from above your ship with the whole sector shown on screen. You can turn your ship left and right as well as thrust forward and you must shoot anything that moves on the screen. Once a sector is cleared you must enter a gate to move to the next one.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Micro Media", "publishers": "Kingsoft", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79m0pa8O9zg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/110506-master-blaster-zeppelin-games\n"}
