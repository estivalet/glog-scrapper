{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mini Boulder", "overview": "A boulder Dash style game that was part of the \"Antics\" game pack. Tired of the normal programming work, the Artgames team rummaged through the archive box again and discovered four slightly older, previously unreleased games. Since Mini-Boulder is not only small and compact, but also a lot of fun to play, it was decided to it up to date by reprogramming and to publish it along with Elvin, Chip-War and Dulcedo Cogitations (Sweet thoughts) together in the Antics four pack. Digitized graphics and five harmonious sounds for four times the fun!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Peter W.
