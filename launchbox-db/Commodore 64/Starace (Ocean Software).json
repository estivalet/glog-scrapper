{"altername_name": [], "name": "Starace (Ocean Software)", "overview": "A lot of you will remember seeing this game on the ZZap64 magazine covertape one issue\u2026 but it wasn\u2019t specially designed for the magazine\u2026. It was originally programmed for Ocean, but Ocean didn\u2019t like the game as they felt it wouldn\u2019t sell and decided not to release it, and so Denton Designs were stuck with a complete game. The main problem really was that the vector graphics were a bit slow. After Denton Designs looked for another publisher, without success, they sold the game to Zzap64 for them to spread on their covertape at a small cost to cover their losses. The game itself features some slowish vector graphics, and involves you in a race within a series of tunnels against other crafts (All looking a bit Starfox style)\u2026 A nice addictive game, if only held back by the slowness. The game\u2019s graphics were created by the same guy who was working on Megatree, Stuart Fotheringham with fantastic music by Fred Grey.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Denton Designs", "publishers": "Zzap! 64", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/169677-starace-ocean-software\n"}
