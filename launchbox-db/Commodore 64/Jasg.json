{"altername_name": [], "name": "Jasg", "overview": "Published in Magic Disk 64 1990/04. JASG challenges you to control a jumping ball through several mazes and collect all dots. It sounds so deceptively simple. Fittingly, the title screen reveals that JASG stands for (It's) Just A Simple Game. I like the graphical elements on display here which feel inspired by Uridium's clean bas-relief style with stark shadows. The blue arrow pointing at the traffic light is a cursor that can be switched between the menu options for starting the game, loading custom levels from disk, and saving the high scores. This is another case where a level editor was intended to be included with the game but couldn't make it onto the disk in time. JASG's editor would be released in the next Magic Disk 64 issue, May 1990. Bounce over the deadly black dots, avoid the cyan spts and only hit the silver dots. Do this as quickly as possible as there is a timer counting you down.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Fred DC", "publishers": "CP Verlag", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/107180-jasg\n"}
