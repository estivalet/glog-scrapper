{"altername_name": [], "name": "International Rugby Simulator", "overview": "Seven-a-side rugby union is brought to life in this budget game. The action is viewed from the side, although kicks to the posts are played from a behind-the-posts perspective. Scrums and line-outs are incorporated for as realistic a game as possible given the player restriction. A tournament can be played with up to 8 players, with as many computer teams as required to fill the gaps.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ted Carron", "publishers": "Codemasters", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "1", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/108507-international-rugby-simulator\n"}
