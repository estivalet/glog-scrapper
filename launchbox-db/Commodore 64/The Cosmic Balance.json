{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Cosmic Balance", "overview": "Design your own starships and send them out for combat against the computer player. With limited space for equipment, a ship designer must decide whether to load up the ship with weapons and go for an all-out attack, add shields and deflectors to protect your ship, or use high tech propulsion and run rings around the opponent. Ships can be sized from a corvette class all the way to a massive battlestar. Once complete, you enter combat vs. against a similar-sized ship, which also can be you or someone else's design, or a computer generated ship. The computer resolves combat as you watch the ships battle.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Paul Murray", "publishers": "Strategic Simulations", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cosmic_Balance", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/94018-the-cosmic-balance\n"}
