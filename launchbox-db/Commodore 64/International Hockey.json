{"altername_name": ["Ice Hockey"], "name": "International Hockey", "overview": "International Hockey is the sequel to Artworx's SLAP-SHOT!. The game features standard single player vs computer (3 skill levels) and two-player head-to-head modes. Controls offer precision passing, bone crushing body checks, penalty shots and a shootout mode. Make use of the boards in the arena to advance the puck. The player closest to the puck is under your control; others appear ghosted-out. Digitized speech, crowd noise and an organist add to the feel of the experience.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Superior Quality Software", "publishers": "Advantage Artworx", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvX9KxZCajs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/62587-international-hockey\n"}
