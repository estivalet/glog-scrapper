The adventure game listed on the next few pages must be considered the ultimate experience for all you 'Trekkies' or 'Trekkers' out there. The horrific news brought to all manner of living beings in the known galaxy by the interstellar video news system, has set men's (and other things'!) minds in turmoil. The Klingons have reneged on the peace treaty and are even now conducting raids upon the Federation's outlying bases. The Federation, in the face of the despicable behaviour of the Klingon Emperor, has had no alternative but to go to WAR! Captain James T. Kirk has been conspicuous only by his absence in this debacle and you!, yes, you the player have been chosen to lead the defense, captaining the Star Ship Enterprise, aided by the faithful retainer and trusty, half human, pointy eared First Officer Spock. After a familiarization sortie, you progressively take on more and more difficult tasks until almost unaided you are defending the Federation against the evil might of the Klingons.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Richard Franklin", "publishers": "Commodore Computing International (CCI)", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/170118-star-trek-duckworth-home-computing\n"}
