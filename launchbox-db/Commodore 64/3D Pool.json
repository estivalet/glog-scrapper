{"altername_name": ["Maltese Joe Plays 3-D Pool"], "name": "3D Pool", "overview": "3D Pool is one of the earliest 3D cue-sports games, featuring a fully-rotating table and variable viewpoint allowing for much more realistic shot-playing than the traditional top-down game style (although the game can be played this way instead). The pace, spin and angle of each shot can be set up precisely before playing it. Both 8-ball (pot your seven colors plus the black to win) and 9-ball (pot the 9-ball with a shot that also hits the lowest remaining ball, whatever that may be) are included. There are seven skill levels to work through. A trick-shot mode is also included, with 20 pre-set shots. Prior to each match it is possible to bet on the outcome.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Aardvark Software", "publishers": "Firebird Software", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.11", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isCOS48JmXo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/74732-3d-pool\n"}
