{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bridge 5.0", "overview": "Bridge 5.0 is the fifth in a series of 1-player card game simulators. Gameplay follows standard bridge rules, and cards are graphically displayed on the screen as they are played. Bidding is based on the five-card Stayman and Blackman conventions. The program reviews the bidding, keeps track of the score, and informs the player of any illegal moves. The player can choose from a number of different hands to start, and can also choose to play as their computer partner or have them automated. The player can store interesting hands to disk, and change hands from one player to another.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Arthur M.
