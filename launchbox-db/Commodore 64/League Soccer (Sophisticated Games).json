{"altername_name": ["64 League Soccer"], "name": "League Soccer (Sophisticated Games)", "overview": "Released in 1984, League Soccer is a mail-order only game by Sophisticated Games designed to simulate a soccer season. The player is able to configure a league with between 2 and 24 teams of their choice. Each team is given a rating between 1 and 9 which will affect their ability throughout the game and can be given a name of up to 8 characters. The main menu gives you several options and the first gives you the ability to simulate a week of the season. This will show you all of the games for that week and allow you to give a score out of 100 which will bias the chances of the home team. This will default to a value based on the ratings of the teams involved but can be adjusted if required.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "R.
