We regret . . . were the last words transmitted by the scouts who passed through the B-screens in the course of \"MISSION NADA\". So we are unable to tell you anything more that will prepare you for this mission. Since you have already shown courage in the face of death, by entering the kiosk and depositing 9.80 DM from the depths of your pants pockets and fearlessly placed the monies on the dark sales counter you are also free to enjoy the fulfillment of this task. So step in, and with your space glider on a journey into the unknown, fare well. We will not hold you back, but wish that if the Devil chases you, you will be faster than his trident.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Haavar B.
