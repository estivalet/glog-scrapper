{"altername_name": ["Apache Raid"], "name": "Indian Attack", "overview": "Apache Attack (also released as Indian Attack) is a single screen 1st person shooter where you must protect your homestead and your party of six from hostile Redskins who are attempting to scalp you all. You are looking out of the window while various Indians ride past on horses, and with a cross-hair, you must shoot as many as you can. After a few Indians have rode past, some Indians, one at a time, appear from the top of the screen inside your cabin, and when they hit the floor run either to the left or right. If you allow any to run off the screen then one of six smiley faces at the bottom of the screen turn into a sad face because they have been scalped. Once all six have been scalped then you are last and when they get you, it is game over. The game allowed you to either use a joystick or a Stack Light Rifle to control the cross-hair but the re-release by Omega Software removed the option of the rifle.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Anirog Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.8", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/87242-indian-attack\n"}
