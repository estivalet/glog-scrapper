{"altername_name": [], "name": "Shogun (J & F Publishing)", "overview": "Shogun is based on the Japanese board game Hasami Shogi. A piece can only move forward, sideways, or backward. Diagonal moves are not allowed. A piece can move to an adjacent empty square, or junp any adjacent piece (the attacker's or the defender's) and land on an empty square. The jumped piece is NOT captured. White always moves first. A piece is captured by squeezing it between two of the attacker's pieces. That is, when the attacker gets one on either side (except diagonal) of a defender's piece, the defender's piece is captured. Captured pieces are removed from play. A piece is not captured if it moves between two pieces. There are no double moves. In the original game, to win, you had to capture all of your opponent's pieces. This version has optional victory conditions. The game came be won by the first player to capture a specified number of pieces in a specified number of turns. This game was developed by Lance C.
