You also have been turned into a bird but luckily the transformation wasn't complete and you kept your brain. You have decided that you are the only one who can defeat the Kremins and break the spell. In this arcade-like platform game you have to explore their huge flick-screen domain looking for the serum to turn you into a human. A wizard also needs finding to strengthen your weakened heart before collecting four pieces of a nuclear fuel to place in the reactor room to blow the domain up, destroy all Kremins and break the spell.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Pedigree Software", "publishers": "Gremlin Graphics Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaVS2aBJ-hs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75960-metabolis\n"}
