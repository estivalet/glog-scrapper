{"altername_name": [], "name": "Double Sphere", "overview": "It's a sports game resembling american football or rugby, but with two astronauts. You play the cyan-coloured player against the computer. Double Sphere is one of those made-up sci-fi sports games you find on platforms from time to time, especially the retro platforms. It's a game that describes itself as space rugby. Two players that look like astronauts fly around the play field trying to maintain control of the ball and trying to throw it into the appropriate goal. The graphics are a little simplistic but it has some really nice music.
