{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Wall", "overview": "A breakout variant for you and 3 of your friends, published in Magic Disk 64 1990/05. As the name suggests, The Wall has something to do with a wall. It is also correct that there is a ball in play, with which the said wall must be destroyed in order to reach the next level. As soon as the ball leaves the lower edge of the screen, it is lost and a ball from the storage chamber, which contains 9 balls, is made available. When all balls are used up, the game is over. But if you fend off the ball skilfully with the bat, it will take a while before it comes to that.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Blue Chip", "publishers": "CP Verlag", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yxOHEJDCG4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/135080-the-wall\n"}
