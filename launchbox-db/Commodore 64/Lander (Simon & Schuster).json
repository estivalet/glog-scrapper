{"altername_name": [], "name": "Lander (Simon & Schuster)", "overview": "A game by Henry Mullish and Herbert Cooper from the book \"Zappers for the Commodore 64\". In this game the player controls a space vehicle which is trying to land on the planet Commodon. As the game opens up the landing vehicle is seen floating downward in the middle of the screen. In a short while the landing vehicle starts to meet on- coming and randomly located meteors. The ship must steer its way through this barrage without striking any of these meteors, in order to reach the planet's surface. For each row of meteors successfully dodged, the player scores points which are displayed at the top of the screen. An extra bonus is awarded for reaching the planet's surface unscathed. The game may be played at five levels of difficulty. The higher the level the greater the density of the meteor cloud and the more points are scored. Level 1 is rather easy while level 5 may well prove to be impossible.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Henry Mullish", "publishers": "Simon & Schuster, Inc.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109309-lander-simon-schuster\n"}
