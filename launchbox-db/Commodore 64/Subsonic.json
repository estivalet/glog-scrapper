{"altername_name": [], "name": "Subsonic", "overview": "A game once released on the cover of Zzap 64 back in the day (Zzap!64 Megatape #30), a cool Galaxian type game by the creators of Orcus and possibly using some of its sprites. Haydn Dolly Dalton, Mike Ager and Jens-Christian Huus worked on another project together that was never independently released BUT was on the cover of Zzap64. The game was called \"Subsonic\". It was a 2player simultaneous Galaxian type game. It was 100% complete and Mike may still have the original. I\u2019m sure I still have the magazine and possibly the cassette with it on.\" This game was touted around various budget companies to make a quick buck for the developers, but sadly no-one took on the game. The developers then decided to sell the game to Zzap 64 for a quick profit, and the game was eventually released to the world through their cover mount. Good thing is that you can still play the game thanks to Zzap, and check out a rather nice game and a glimpse of some Orcus like techniques in a complete game by the developers.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Michael Ager", "publishers": "Zzap! 64", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZUuiDCUfMc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/160029-subsonic\n"}
