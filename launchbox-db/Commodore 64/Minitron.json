{"altername_name": [], "name": "Minitron", "overview": "A stripped down, mini version of Tron, published in Magic Disk 64 1995/05. This fast-paced racing game is based on the movie Tron and is set in the distant future. Since the game was developed exclusively for two players, two joysticks must also be connected. With \"+\" and \"-\" you can regulate the speed and adapt it to your personal abilities. Only when both players press the joystick button does the game begin. Each player controls a vehicle that leaves a trace on the race track. You must now be extremely careful not to touch your own trail or that of the opponent. That would mean one point for the opponent. Both players have the option of doubling the speed by holding down the fire button. If a player has reached nine points, the game starts over.
