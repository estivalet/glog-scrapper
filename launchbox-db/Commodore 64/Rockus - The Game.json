{"altername_name": ["Rockus"], "name": "Rockus: The Game", "overview": "Rockus: The Game, or simply Rockus was and a game which was part of a competition held by 64\u2019er magazine back in 1993. Rockus was one of the entries for the competition, but sadly didn\u2019t win, and hence was never released for reasons unknown. It sounds a bit of a shame that this is the only reason for its release, but there you go. Rockus is a flick screen platforming game which is nothing too spectacular, but what makes it very interesting is the fact that the game was around 90% coded in BASIC, and only 10% in Machine code. It\u2019s certainly quite impressive for mainly a BASIC game. You have a main character with a hi-res overlay, and pretty much a simple platforming game. In the game you can punch certain blocks by pressing fire, which will let you get access to extra bonuses. Each level you have to collect a set number of disks and keys and then get to the far right of the landscape. Extras to pick up include diamonds and coins for extra points, umbrellas for a limited spell of invulnerability and the small star-like object for an extra life (don\u2019t confuse it with the star-shaped enemy!) You can also pick up fireballs to throw, although it\u2019s not certain which object gives you that power, and boots to make you run faster. Things are a bit glitchy in places, but overall this is not a bad little game and worth at least 5-10 minutes of your time.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Enrico Kub", "publishers": "Imperial Games Ltd.", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEwJUxRIbg0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/126262-rockus-the-game\n"}
