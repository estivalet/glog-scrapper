{"altername_name": ["Mercenary: Escape from Targ", "Mercenary: Die Flucht von Targ"], "name": "Mercenary", "overview": "Having crash-landed on the planet Targ (en route to the Gamma System of Damocles), the player's main objective is to find a means of escape. In a trademark element of the Mercenary series, there are several ways to achieve this end. A civil war between two factions, the Palyars (indigenous \"good guys\") and the Mechanoids (invading \"bad guys\"), affords the player an opportunity to earn money to buy their escape from Targ. For instance, each faction seeks the destruction of installations belonging to its rival, and the capture of material or other resources to support their cause. There are other routes to escape, and it is possible to combine strategies to both leave Targ and keep the wealth accrued there.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Novagen Software", "publishers": "Novagen", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.38", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercenary_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnZFs49dwS8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6234-mercenary\n"}
