{"altername_name": [], "name": "Balloon Blitz", "overview": "A very simple shooter game where you navigate the sky in a hot air balloon and drop bombs on enemy tanks down below. The game was first published in COMPUTE!'s Gazette 1984/08 (Issue #14), and also in Courbois Software #6431. It was released in Australia and New Zealand as part of \"Red Pack\" compilation. Floating along in your hot-air balloon is a nice way to spend a beautiful summer morning. But you've got a mission; To destroy the enemy's tanks, which are threatening your force's flank. Alone in your anti-tank hot-air balloon, you're drifting along and enjoying the tranquility of a beautiful summer morning. And hoping the enemy stays out of sight \u2014 but you know they won't. They're sending their best tanks (which are wily and evasive) to get to your troop's southern flank, and your job is to destroy them. If you're skillful enough to stop the first wave, you're ready for the next game level. There are 6 difficulty levels with 6 as the most difficult.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "August 2, 1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Michael T.
