{"altername_name": [], "name": "Satan's Hollow", "overview": "The player must shoot flying formations of gargoyles in order to pick up pieces of a bridge that must be built over a river of lava. Once the bridge is completed, the player can cross it to face Satan. Destroying him scores bonus points based on the number of waves completed to that point, and also upgrades the rocket launcher. The player then resumes the battle against the gargoyles and must start building a new, longer bridge in order to fight Satan again. The sky darkens on later waves, making it harder to see the enemies. As the game progresses, the gargoyles begin to throw exploding eggs, along with rocks that can destroy bridge sections; the player also occasionally faces disembodied devil heads that float around the screen and spit fire. In addition to firing rockets at the enemies, the player can use a shield that will destroy any enemy touching it. However, this shield can only be used for a short time before it must shut down to recharge. Gargoyles will sometimes attempt to steal a ship from the player's reserve lives, similar to Galaga.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "David Berezowksi", "publishers": "Commodore Business Machines", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.92", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satan%27s_Hollow", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XOe60do1Vs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/66027-satans-hollow\n"}
