{"altername_name": ["Drax: Evilblood", "Drax Evilblood: The Remix"], "name": "Drax Evilblood", "overview": "The game, created by Mark Gallagher, Ed Campbell and Andrew Rodger, is fairly simple, and has you controlling Drax, who has to kick and destroy various small creatures across a horizontally bi-directionally scrolling game screen. Remeniscent of Chameleon by Electric Dreams in some ways. The early version looks pretty dated, but its the remixed edition which really starts looking very nice indeed.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Deesl Designs", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/158949-drax-evilblood\n"}
