{"altername_name": [], "name": "Brick's Revenge", "overview": "After many years of abuse at the hands of bats and balls the Brick's have had enough. They have now declared war on the world of bats and you are one of the last hopes to hold back their army! On each of the 12 levels you must smash enough bricks to open up the goal zone and then fire a ball into that zone to advance. Dropping the ball won't kill you immediately but if you miss it 3 times in a row you will lose a life. You will also lose a life if hit by a kamikaze brick, laser fire, missiles or the giant brick.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "May 3, 2020", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Stuart Garnham", "publishers": "Bitmap Soft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UJ3--rToo8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/129990-bricks-revenge\n"}
