{"altername_name": [], "name": "Eliminator (Hewson Consultants)", "overview": "A shoot \u2018em up set on a patchwork-quilt coloured road, Eliminator puts you in control of a ship with a basic weapon, flying along at breakneck speed. There are barriers along the way to avoid, often set in quick succession, and lots of bad guys to shoot at or avoid - their shots must be avoided too. Some parts of the track are blocked unless you can shoot through obstacles before reaching them, or hit a jump pad. At some points you can change to travelling along the ceiling as well. Tokens can be collected en route, and used to obtain better weapons, but losing a life costs you the best one you\u2019ve currently got.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hewson Consultants", "publishers": "Hewson Consultants", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/XFoBQiv9Ez8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/77937-eliminator-hewson-consultants\n"}
