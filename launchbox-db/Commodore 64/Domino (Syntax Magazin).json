The program introduces you to the classic domino game: you have to arrange the tablets located at the bottom of the screen on the obligatory path immediately above. Your opponent is the computer, and you have to try to predict its moves that you might play your dominoes wisely. At the beginning the options are many, but as the game progresses the number of dominoes decrease, leaving you far fewer choices. To play a tile, write the number with the keyboard and press return. If you cannot play, enter two asterisks. Whoever manages to finish off the dominoes wins!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bernd Hermann", "publishers": "Edizione Logica 2000", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/115582-domino-syntax-magazin\n"}
