{"altername_name": [], "name": "Towering Inferno", "overview": "Towering Inferno is a 1-player arcade game for the Commodore 64. The player controls firemen with a net at the bottom of a burning building. The player moves laterally to catch falling residents, but residents often bounce, so must be caught several times before being safety caught. Obese residents can not be safely caught, and must be allowed to fall to their death. The player receives bonus points for catching furniture. Some residents burn up in mid-air. If the player misses too many residents, or accidentally catches an obese resident, they lose a life. There are 2 levels of difficulty, and 5 stages.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Pioneer Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ailgc15Cw0k", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133691-towering-inferno\n"}
