The tracks are not roads, but maze-like obstacle courses in the wilderness. It is part maze solving, part combat, part racing against the clock. 5th Gear is a computer game for the Amiga, Atari ST and Commodore 64, released on the Rack-It budget label. The original Commodore 64 version was programmed by Jeroen Leijten, with music by Theo and Renier Hongens. It was largely inspired by previous arcade games Steer and Go and Spy Hunter.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Fantastic Four", "publishers": "Future Publishing", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.15", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5th_Gear_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDmsYHxlruk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/32373-5th-gear\n"}
