{"altername_name": ["Square", "Change"], "name": "X-Change", "overview": "A puzzle game in the vein of Drelbs that was published by Go Games n.11 (July / August 1986) as Change also published under the name Square. In an intricate maze of revolving doors, chased by one or more guardians, you must try to compose as many squares as possible. In these squares you will occasionally see the access door to another game phase or the possibility of accessing higher difficulty levels, but be careful, because in addition to all this you may find yourself facing a certain death or the risk of ending up imprisoned with no possibility of salvation. Move fast and try to be smarter than your enemies.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "J\u00f6rg Dierks", "publishers": "Edizioni Societ\u00e0 SIPE", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "8", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oR7FC2_lj2A", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137579-x-change\n"}
