{"altername_name": [], "name": "Magic Castle", "overview": "You are a brave adventurer, and your quest is to find and explore a Magic Castle to rescue a Princess trapped in the tallest tower. You must be wary of boobytraps and other creatures which are trying to kill you. Magic Castle is a text adventure where the screen has text describing each location that you visit and you type in commands with the keyboard to interact with your surroundings. The game was written in The Quill Adventure Writing System - a utility to create adventure games developed by Gilsoft which was later extended by The Illustrator - an add-on pack that enabled users to add location graphics to their games. Besides providing the tools to create adventure, Gilsoft also released several of its own titles under the Gold Collection label. \"Magic Castle\" was one of them.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Graeme Yeandle", "publishers": "Gilsoft", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/129809-magic-castle\n"}
