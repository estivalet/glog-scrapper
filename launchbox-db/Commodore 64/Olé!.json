{"altername_name": ["Raging Beast", "Ole!", "Corrida", "Ol\u00e9", "Raging Beast: Ol\u00e9!"], "name": "Ol\u00e9!", "overview": "This is one of the few bullfighting games made outside Spain. Once in, players must first type their name in order to let the computer know who will be the \"future matador\". The action takes place in the round scenario of a Plaza in which players have total freedom of movement (just like the bull), the objective being to score as much points as possible by passing the animal with the best arts. Players will also have the possibility to take off the \"capote\" (cloth) in order to run faster and distract the beast in one of those moments of maximum danger. But in case the bull does attack, no problem, the player just has to wake up and take the capote again.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jawx", "publishers": "Firebird Software", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raging_Beast", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0Q0a2yDZCA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/96722-ole\n"}
