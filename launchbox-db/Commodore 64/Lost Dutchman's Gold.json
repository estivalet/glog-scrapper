{"altername_name": [], "name": "Lost Dutchman's Gold", "overview": "Welcome to the search for Dutchman's GOLD. I'm the ghost of backpack Sam, yer guide for this adventure. It's very dangerous and I hope that you don't end up a ghost like me! Deep in the Superstition Mountains of Arizona, hidden in the eerie mists of forgotten times, the Lost Dutchman's Gold Mine awaits the fortune-seeker bold enough to challenge the fates. Protected by bands of hostile Indians, the ravines and gullies harbor silent death for the unwary adventurer. You start in a miner's shack in the desert below the mountains with a mule, a rifle, and a few tools. There is a map hidden somewhere and this is your clue to uncountable wealth. There is a ghost town, and the desert, and, ultimately, the deadly Superstitions to explore as you search for the way to the Lost Dutchman's Mine.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Teri Li", "publishers": "The Guild Adventure Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/121603-lost-dutchmans-gold\n"}
