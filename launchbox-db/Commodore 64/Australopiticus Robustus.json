{"altername_name": [], "name": "Australopiticus Robustus", "overview": "A scrolling screen platformer. In the game you play a group of cavemen (looking very much like the Captain Cavemen cartoon character) that appear to be trying to get from one side of the screen to find his brothers Org and Gnom without getting eaten by a pterosaur of some sort, probably a pteranodon. Use your club to grab items for use elsewhere. Using your club on the dinosaurs and pterosaurs does no good.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Andreas von Lepel", "publishers": "Rainbow Systems", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/87652-australopiticus-robustus\n"}
