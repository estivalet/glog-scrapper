It sounds somewhat like science fiction, and it is. Would you like to be a locomotive driver on the moon, the day spies and DSB lay the first line across it's face? In this Commodore 64 game you get the opportunity to play locomotive drivers, and the work is at least as demanding and dangerous as in the good old Western days of raids and Indian attacks. On the Moon, it's just UFOs and mines that make you dizzy. However, you do have some defensive options. You can jump with the H key and shoot down enemies with SPACE.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "January 1, 1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kurt Andersen", "publishers": "NY Elektronik ApS", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/127616-moon-train\n"}
