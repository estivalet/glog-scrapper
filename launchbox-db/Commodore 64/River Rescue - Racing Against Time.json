{"altername_name": ["River Rescue"], "name": "River Rescue: Racing Against Time", "overview": "The player is in charge of a ship on a river, which flows from right to left across the screen, with a view from above. The ship must avoid colliding with the various obstacles on the river - these include small islands, crocodiles and wood logs. The aim of the game is to rescue the explorers dispersed in the jungle. The ship periodically passes near a couple of piers on both sides of the river. If the ship approaches the upper one, an explorer leaves the jungle and gets on the ship. If you approach the lower one instead, all the explorers on the ship are going down, which are considered to be rescued. Due to the automatic scrolling of the screen, it is not possible to stop at both piers at once, you have to pick up the explorer on board and wait for the next dock. Depending on the version and level, you must save between three and five explorers to complete a round. Once a round is complete, the game begins again, but at a higher speed.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Thorn EMI Video", "publishers": "Alternative Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Rescue", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOpT4DiZ7-E", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109469-river-rescue-racing-against-time\n"}
