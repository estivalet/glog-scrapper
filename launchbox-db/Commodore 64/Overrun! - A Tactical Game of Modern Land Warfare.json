{"altername_name": ["Overrun!"], "name": "Overrun!: A Tactical Game of Modern Land Warfare", "overview": "Overrun! offers meticulous simulation of late twentieth-century squad-level action in European and Middle Eastern terrain. Players command a battalion of infantry, armor, artillery, and helicopters on behalf of Arab states, Iran, Israel, NATO, and the Warsaw Pact. The bulk of scenarios are speculative and near-future (including an Iranian invasion of Kuwait), but one historic war is presented, the 1973 Arab-Israeli \"October War.\" A single-player campaign of randomly generated maps starts you with a core force which you will hopefully retain and expand with each victory.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gary Grigsby", "publishers": "Strategic Simulations", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/111758-overrun-a-tactical-game-of-modern-land-warfare\n"}
