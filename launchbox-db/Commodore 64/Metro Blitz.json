{"altername_name": [], "name": "Metro Blitz", "overview": "Metro Blitz is a side view single screen shooter where you control a spacecraft to protect a huge city below, from an alien attack of various waves. To destroy the city, the aliens will appear from the edges of the screen and crash into the city to destroy a part of it. Once the words Metro-Blitz have been removed from beneath the city then you have failed and it is game over. To stop the aliens you have to keep shooting them while avoiding touching them or the sides of the screen, or you lose one of ten lives. To move to the next wave you have to survive while a bar decreases and when it disappears then you move to the next wave. You can select your starting wave on the title screen (1 - 24).
