{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hot Wheels (Markt & Technik)", "overview": "Published in 64'er 1984/06. This is a motorcycle racing game, not to be confused with the Epyx/Mattel juggernaut that was released the following year. The aim of the game is to ride a motorbike along a road with as few accidents as possible and to get as far as possible. This is made more difficult by stones on the road and roadblocks. After reaching 2000 points you get to the next level of difficulty, which then requires a little more skill. The number of obstacles and the speed increase from level to level, with a maximum of three levels that can be completed. Moving the joystick in the \"forward\" direction increases the speed, which is throttled again in the \"back\" direction. Of course, the score increases in proportion to the speed.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bernd G\u00fcnther", "publishers": "Markt & Technik", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/105569-hot-wheels-markt-technik\n"}
