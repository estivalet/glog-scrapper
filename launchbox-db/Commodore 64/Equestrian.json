{"altername_name": ["Equestrian 64"], "name": "Equestrian", "overview": "Published in Commodore Microcomputers Magazine 1986/07-08, and also in Loadstar #026. Starting off with five horses, your objective is to jump over as many mushrooms as you can. Pressing the fire button will cause the horse to jump. Killer bees will try to hinder your mushroom jumping. Positioning the joystick upwards will shoot an arrow which will kill a bee, but not a mushroom. You will lose a horse each time it collides with a mushroom or a bee. There are six stages to the game. Each succeeding stage is more difficult than the last. Advancing to the next stage is accomplished by jumping over 15 mushrooms. Every mushroom jumped and each bee killed will add points to your score. The number of points you receive increases as you advance through the stages.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Scot S.
