{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Citadel of Chaos", "overview": "You are a lone adventurer, trekking to the grim fort atop Craggen Rock in hopes to save the peaceful Vale of the Willow below by infiltrating the chaotic legions of the Black Tower and defeating their leader, the warlock Balthus Dire. You will rely on your spellbook, your blade, and your wits to navigate the labyrinthine corridors there and evade or escape from those of its denizens you can't easily dispatch. The Vale is depending on you! A very by-the-book adaptation of Steve Jackson's Fighting Fantasy gamebook #2, published the previous year, this computer game version dishes up its Choose-Your-Own-Adventure illustrated multiple-choice plot paths courtesy of pages of narrative text displaying down an endless scroll and automates the random RPG elements of generating and managing your character's statistics, inventory and performance in combat, ordinarily determined through die rolls.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Darryl K.
