{"altername_name": [], "name": "Zelta Pass", "overview": "Players control a spacecraft who must make its way through wave after wave of enemy fire and defeat the mothership at the end of each one. The craft is equipped with two built-in lasers which can be used to destroy enemies. Some waves require the player to navigate their ship through a specific path, making sure to avoid coming into contact with any walls. If the craft collides with an enemy or hits a wall, it is destroyed and a new one take its place. Players are supplied with three ships, and if all of them are destroyed, the game is over. Zelta Pass was created using the Shoot 'Em Up Construction Kit.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Chris Yates", "publishers": "ECP (Entertainment and Computer Products Pty.
