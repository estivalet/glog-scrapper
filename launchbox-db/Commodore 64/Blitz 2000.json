When it reaches the far end of the screen, it reappears on the other end, but at a lower altitude since it is running out of fuel. The objective is to drop bombs on the city to destroy all buildings so that it may land on level ground. The game was developed by Visualize Development Group, and originally published by Visualize Software. It was also published in Commodore Zone Issue #03 (January/February 1996) and was later re-released in 2006 by Cronosoft.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Visualize Development Group", "publishers": "Commodore Zone", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/88534-blitz-2000\n"}
