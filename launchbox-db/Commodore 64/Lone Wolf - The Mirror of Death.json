Imprisoned in his flick-screen tower, Gorazh has filled it with monsters and traps, the most insidious of which was a magic mirror, Dhazag-Oud, whose seven shards reflect back superior counterparts of whoever gazes upon them (and which subsequently result in boss battles.)", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mr. Micro", "publishers": "Audiogenic Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.75", "wikipedia": "https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lone_Wolf:_The_Mirror_of_Death", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qayj31A0tSg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/110454-lone-wolf-the-mirror-of-death\n"}
