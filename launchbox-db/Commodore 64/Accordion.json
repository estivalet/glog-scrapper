{"altername_name": [], "name": "Accordion", "overview": "A computerized version of the popular solitaire card game of the same name, developed by Maurice Jones and published by J & F Publishing, Inc. in the disk magazine Loadstar. Issue #196. The rules: Any pile can be moved onto the pile to its left, or the pile third to its left, provided the top cards of the piles match in either suit or rank. When you move a pile in the middle of the row, all the other piles are shifted to fill an empty space. Strategy tips: You should select four cards of the same rank, clustered near each other and near the end of the layout. The strategy is to try to get all four selected cards to the end of the layout and never cover them with anything else until the very end of the game.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Maurice Jones", "publishers": "J & F Publishing", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86638-accordion\n"}
