{"altername_name": [], "name": "Total Eclipse", "overview": "The game backstory as explained in the manual is that an evil Ancient Egyptian priest has put a curse on a massive pyramid dedicated to the Sun God, Ra. Any object obstructing Ra's shrine from the Sun would be destroyed. The protagonist is an unnamed archeologist who learns that October 26, 1930, a total eclipse will obstruct the sun above Cairo, and the protagonist realized that the curse will cause the Moon to explode, devastating Earth with its debris. The protagonist then decides to travel to that pyramid and destroy the shrine to Ra, preventing the curse/prophecy. The game starts with the protagonist having just arrived with a biplane parked outside the pyramid he is about to enter, two hours before the eclipse. The player has to enter and explore the pyramid, avoid traps, trigger and activate puzzles and navigate through maze-like rooms. Causes of death include dehydration, and heart attack caused by various hazards such as falling off ledges, getting crushed by falling stones and taking hits from poison darts. Throughout the maze the player can discover treasure to accumulate the score, and also ankhs that serve as keys to locked doors.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Major Developments", "publishers": "Incentive Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.12", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Eclipse_(1988_video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRxfbHY3r7g", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/57127-total-eclipse\n"}
