{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cohan's Land", "overview": "Cohan's Land is a German language text adventure for the Commodore 64. It was developed by Michael Nickles and published in 64'er Sonderheft 1986/04. Discover the secret of the message in the bottle. Is the treasure really there or is it just a joke? You don't have to walk around and read nice room descriptions as with INFOCOM - things really get going right away. Same with Cohan's Land. The texts are kept short, but the problems are extremely tricky. However, the parser turned out much better. The vocabulary includes about 140 words and the parser understands whole sentences. Nevertheless, the program is only about 30 Kbytes long. The story is extremely interesting: Fantasy, science fiction and nostalgia elements appear in the game.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "April 1, 1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Michael Nickles", "publishers": "Markt & Technik", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/166847-cohans-land\n"}
