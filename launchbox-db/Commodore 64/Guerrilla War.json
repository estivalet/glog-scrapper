{"altername_name": ["Guevara"], "name": "Guerrilla War", "overview": "A tropical island (specified as Cuba in the Japanese original) is being oppressed by a dictator, but fortunately one or two brave US soldiers (Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara in the Japanese version) are on hand to restore justice. March through the rivers, swamps and forests to overthrow the dictator (specified as Batista in Japan) in this evolution of the Commando style. The game scrolls vertically, as you move up the screen shooting enemies, finding good strategic firing points and collecting powerups. As the enemy soldiers come towards you in groups, some care is required when picking them off, either using your gun or the grenades. There are also hostages carried by some soldiers, with points bonuses for not shooting these but shooting their captors. Each level ends with a boss.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sentient Software", "publishers": "Data East", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrilla_War_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9kAxX5USdA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83548-guerrilla-war\n"}
