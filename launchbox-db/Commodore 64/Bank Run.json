{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bank Run", "overview": "The Bank of the Wild West is being trashed out by the gunslingers of the Bounty Boys. You are a Sheriff who is in charge of this goddarn stinkin' town. You have been assigned to guard the bank, as a series of robberies have been taking place quite recently. Who is to blame for this? The Bounty Boys of course, A series of gunslingers, who want nothing but money. They will give it their best shot to get what the want. It's time to draw! As a Sherrif in this goddarn' stinkin' town. You must guard the bank respectfully. Just as you thought the bank was very quiet. The customers come rolling in. And also uninvited pests - those robbin' gunslingers. Move your crosshair left/right across the screen, shooting at the robbers that come by. You'll see the firing bullets, slightly near the bottom of your crosshair. There are going to be some situations in which you must shoot carefully. As some of those robbers will be ready to cause havoc to you and the bank. There are also visitors coming into the bank (as said before). If you pop them full of lead you'll have to pay a penalty of losing a life. The people you must avoid shooting are: the fair ladies and the unarmed men. At times during the game, you will need fast reactions. Especially if those bad guys fire something out of their guns. There will also be round bombs, in which you must blast quickly before they explode. It's a rootin', a tootin' and a whole lotta shootin' Sherrif!
