You choose the strength of your opponent to begin with (1 is easy, right up to 9, which is extremely difficult). The bell rings and the round has begun. You'll see the time in the top left hand corner, while the top right hand corner shows the number of rounds fought. To knock out your opponent, you must get his score above ten. Once a player has been knocked down, a count of ten will be begun. If the count reaches ten, then it is classed as a knock out. If a player gets knocked down three times in a round, that will also be classed as a knock out. If you knock out your opponent, then a stronger opponent will come to challenge you.
