{"altername_name": ["Rats Domain"], "name": "Domain", "overview": "Domain is a very obscure and weird game, where you run around, pick up items and use them in other rooms, while being attacked by rats and dogs. The game has almost no text and would leave you wondering about the plot if the title screen didn't hint being based on James Herbert's horror novel of the same name (if rather loosely, since all other human characters and many scenes are missing). In 1986, London is unexpectedly nuked by 5 bombs and you are one of the survivors (possibly the book's protagonist Steve Culver). Most interesting is the unique and professional music.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/96950-domain\n"}
