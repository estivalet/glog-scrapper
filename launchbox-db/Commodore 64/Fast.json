{"altername_name": ["Boar", "Alpha"], "name": "Fast", "overview": "You race over the surface of a planet trying to avoid collisions with any nasty hard objects that happen to get in the way. You're going to need a good joystick and some dodging skills. Best when experienced as a two-player game, it is the clincher. Rushing along the metallic landscape trying to force each other into obstacles. You don't have any offensive weaponry, so the only way to stop your opponent is by slamming him with tooth-loosening force against the walls. If you glance off an obstacle you will spin around and lose control for a moment. On the risky route you'll be taking are loads and loads of collectables. These range from simple point additions to nasty things like speed-ups to double everyone's speed, slow downs, ones that cause darkness and ones that switch points with your opponent. 100 levls of non-stop, mayhem type action. the race starts as soon as the second human racer hits fire in the head-to-head match ups so be ready to speed!
