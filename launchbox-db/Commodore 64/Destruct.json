{"altername_name": [], "name": "Destruct", "overview": "Over 20 levels of fast and furious arcade action, interlinked by an ingenious bonus section, making this one of the most addictive games you'll ever play. Fly over the surface of the planet in your battle-armoured jet suit, finding off attacks by enemy aircraft and guided missiles, while avoiding the deadly landscape features. At the end of each level you'll be confronted by a gigantic mothership, invulnerable to normal lasers. So shoot the asteroids that are flying over the planet to reveal crystals. Once you've collected the crystals they can be used against the mothership. If successful a friendly alien will transport you to the next stage, during this journey you must hit the red energy orb to keep it in front of you.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Foxsoft", "publishers": "The Power House", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZXL-mffPZ4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/160661-destruct\n"}
