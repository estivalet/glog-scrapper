This hack was done by Louis F. Sander and released into the public domain in 1988. There's not a lot of difference between this and the original version, apart from the fact that this version has more color (Commodore's version was monochrome using the standard C64 blue background and the default text color) and plays a little faster.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Louis F.
