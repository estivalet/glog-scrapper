{"altername_name": ["Grover's Animal Adventure"], "name": "Grover's Animal Adventures", "overview": "Who's that out on the African Plain? Why, it's Grover, and he's here to help children identify animals and place them where they belong: on the land, in the sky, or in the water. Children learn about nature in four different environments while correctly placing animals that animate as they move. At the same time they create colorful, custom-made pictures of Grover and his friends. In Grover's Animal Adventures, children feel right at home with their furry old friend Grover as he takes them to the African Grasslands, the Atlantic Ocean, a North American Forest, and a Barnyard not too far away from Sesame Street. Children select animals and objects from nature, see the animals actually move, and learn where they are most commonly found by placing them on land, in water, or in the sky! They'll also begin to associate animals and objects with their printed names and have fun creating their own nature scenes! The accompanying manual includes step-by-step instructions. With lively, colorful graphics and music, this exciting computer activity brings the world of animals and nature home for every child. It's like having a friendly zoo at their fingertips! This product was developed by Children's Television Workshop, producers of Sesame Street, The Electric Company, 3-2-1 Contact and Square One TV. CTW software is designed to attract and hold children's interest, providing an environment in which they can grow and learn.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Children's Television Workshop", "publishers": "Hi-Tech Expressions", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/102912-grovers-animal-adventures\n"}
