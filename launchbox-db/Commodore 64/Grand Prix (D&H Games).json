{"altername_name": [], "name": "Grand Prix (D&H Games)", "overview": "Grand Prix is a managerial game which allows you and a friend the chance to run a Formula One Grand Prix team. Before your season of racing starts you can select your sponsors which include major, minor, engine and tyres. As well as ensuring your cars are able to compete you have to also manage your finances and the rest of your team. An option to bet on races is also there. After you're happy with your choices and you've practised the cars on the track, it's off to the main race. This part of the game is viewed from above the track at the start/finish line and pits. All you can do is watch the cars drive past and wait for the laps to wind down to zero. The keyboard is used to control the game.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "D&H Games", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/102689-grand-prix-dh-games\n"}
