{"altername_name": [], "name": "Steve Cartwright's Megamania", "overview": "A game sample of \"Garry Kitchen's GameMaker\" based loosely on the popular Atari 2600 shooter. You control a spaceship at the bottom of the screen and need to defend yourself from numerous waves of attackers. But in MegaMania, the attackers are much more bizarre than just invading aliens taking many strange and laughable forms. You need to earn points by destroying as many of these strange attackers as you can before your energy supply becomes depleted.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dan Kitchen", "publishers": "Activision", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/130580-steve-cartwrights-megamania\n"}
