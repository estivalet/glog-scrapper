{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pushover 64", "overview": "Commodore 64 Port from the original Amiga game by Ocean Aim of the game is to complete each stage by placing the bricks in the correct order so that the last one falling will be the trigger. You have one try only, if you push the stopper brick you waste your chance to complete the stage. At this point you can only restart the level. By completing each stage you gain a token which allows you to restart just before your last push. https://ready64.org/hosted/pushover64/", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "January 14, 2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Michelangelo Carbonara", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/369624-pushover-64\n"}
