The story begins when agent Keene's boss sends him on one of two missions: to Vienna to investigate the mysterious disappearance of a famous professor, or to solve the mystery of strange self-replicating non-functioning fire hydrants. While reading from page to page like a comic magazine, you can interact with the characters when you choose what Keene should do or say; sometimes you even can take control over Keene to surpass action sequences.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Distinctive Software, Inc.", "publishers": "Accolade", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.23", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accolade%27s_Comics", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbaKRq1QK0E", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86592-accolades-comics-featuring-steve-keene-thrillseeker\n"}
