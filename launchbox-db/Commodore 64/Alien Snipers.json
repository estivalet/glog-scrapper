{"altername_name": [], "name": "Alien Snipers", "overview": "Alien Snipers is a reaction/typing game published in a book \"Computer Spacegames\". After selecting the difficulty, your computer will print a letter and a number. You must think through the alphabet by that number of letters and type in the letter you get to. E.g. for M 4, you must type Q, and for C 2, you must type E and so on. Typing in a letter automatically triggers off your laser gun, so if your letter is correct you'll score a hit. You get 10 alien snipers each game.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Usborne Publishing Limited", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/373937-alien-snipers\n"}
