{"altername_name": [], "name": "3-D Maze (Sportscene Specialist Press)", "overview": "Published in Your 64 No.08 1985/04, in this game basically you're stuck in the middle of a labyrinth...and you suddenly realize that there's a time-lock fitted to the only exit! Before you start off, you'll be able to see a plan view of the maze being drawn on screen. The exit is always at the top-right of the screen and you, the handsome blue asterisk, must start off in the bottom left-hand corner; the maze in between, as you may have already guessed, is drawn randomly each time, so there is no way of memorizing the twisting corridors to your goal. Once you've seen the maze for 10 seconds you're OFF! On your left your view of the maze, on the right you will see a digital clock (aren't all computer generated clocks digital?) counting out those precious seconds 'till the exit is sealed forever! You'll also be provided a compass (A compass, which is stock and this thing that tells time? ) that you can use as a guide on your travels. Just remember, time is NOT on your side.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "R.
