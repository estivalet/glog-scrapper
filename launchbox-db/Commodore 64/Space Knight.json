{"altername_name": ["Future Bomber"], "name": "Space Knight", "overview": "A vertically scrolling space shooter. Sector 93D in the year 2073, the Alpha-Pluto base was attacked. The defense forces did not manage to disperse the mass attack of the Rovolians. Fortunately, a group of inhabitants of the colony managed to escape the clutches of the aliens and hid in the radioactive deposits, enclosed within leaden walls to resist until reinforcements can arrive. Unfortunately, as you know, a place like this is not very healthy, and that is why you have volunteered to go with your Space Knight fighter to help them. As soon as you fly over the base you will realize that the enemy has not been idle, but has taken over the anti-aircraft systems to attack you from your own base! Waves of his shuttles appear from all over to thwart you, you will you be able to withstand the various waves unharmed?!
