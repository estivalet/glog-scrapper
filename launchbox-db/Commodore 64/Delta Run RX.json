Also some slightly redesigned background has been used. Greetings Pilot. Prepare for the Delta Run ... The Space Pirates have been raiding passers by across the Galaxy. Nowhere is now safe in space. Space Agents have discovered that pirates have built 4 Delta Bases. Two in space, and two on board their planet. The last Delta Base was severly damaged under construction. On each Delta Base, you will be fighting against assorted alien space pirates. Your job is to simply infiltrate them and their guardians. Pick up crystals to score bonus points, gain extra lives or power ups. Can you clear all 4 Delta Bases and leave one final surprise for the Space Pirates? Their fate is in your hands.
