{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gold Swappers", "overview": "Gold Swappers is a board game for the Commodore 64. It was developed by Jim Green and released into the public domain in 1989. It was coded entirely in BASIC. Description: Well, you see, there were these two guys and each had four gold coins. Problem is, both were greedy and wanted all of them, so they played this game. It is played by moving the gold (represented by the small yellow circles/dots) between four boxes. Each box starts off with two pieces of gold. In turn, the players take the gold from one of their boxes and distribute it counterclockwise to the other three boxes. There will always be at least one empty box, because during each move gold cannot be put back into the box from which it was taken. To win the game and satisfy your greed, you must get all the gold in one of your own boxes.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jim Green", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/163302-gold-swappers\n"}
