{"altername_name": [], "name": "Zoo Mania", "overview": "The main aim at ZOO Mania is to catch animals for the Zoo. For this the player needs to try to place at least three animnals of the same type in a row (vertically or horizontally). As soon as a group of three or bigger gets together, the animals count as captured and new animals come in from the top. In the first level each three animals from different types need to be caught. The number of animals rises from level to level. Thw wohle thing would be relatively easy, if it wasn't for the time factor. If no combination is found, the lower time bar will shrink. This can grow by doing combinations or by a bonus animal. The bonus animals appear in irregular intervals and flash by turns. As soon as the player clicks on it all animals of this type get caught.
