{"altername_name": [], "name": "Racked Off", "overview": "Barry the Bear wakes up and finds himself stranded on a strange planet full of different coloured gardens. The poor bear is starving so it is up to you to help Barry gather all the food for a good feast. Unfortunately he's not alone as there are alien bugs guarding the gardens, and they're racked off about your intrusion. Avoid the racked off alien bugs and also time. Things to watch out for: - Alien bugs (They're you worse nightmare) - Boulders (You will need to walk around those, because they are alway blocking your path) - Water (Barry can't swim) - Magic pad. (Touch this and something magical happens, which is good for Barry) - Time (You have a time limit to complete each level. Fail to do so, then too bad) You have 16 levels to complete.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2007", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Johan Janssen", "publishers": "The New Dimension (TND)", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwcxpR5NlkE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/124992-racked-off\n"}
