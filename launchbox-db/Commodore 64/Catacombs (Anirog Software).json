{"altername_name": [], "name": "Catacombs (Anirog Software)", "overview": "Your village is cursed with a plague and the only solution available is for you to go into the underground Catacombs to find a mysterious sorcerer. No one is sure if he is good or evil but his powers came from potions he brewed so you need to get the formula for the potion needed and collect the ingredients. Before you start your quest you can choose which role to take, fighter Duke or cunning Witch, each with their own strength and weaknesses. As you explore, you will encounter creatures that can be talked to or some will need fighting and killed before you are killed. The game is a graphic text adventure with text on the screen describing each location you are in and a picture of what you can see. You type in commands with the keyboard to interact with your surroundings.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Brian Clark & Marian Clark", "publishers": "Anirog Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcoVBxdVtpw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90372-catacombs-anirog-software\n"}
