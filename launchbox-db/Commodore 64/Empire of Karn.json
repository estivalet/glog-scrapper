{"altername_name": ["The Open Seas"], "name": "Empire of Karn", "overview": "The king of Vorzdeshaa is planing to overthrow the Emperor of Karn. Since the Emperor does not want to go to war with his allied country, he sends you, a stranger from a different world along with Darin, a descendant of Beren, one of the Heroes of Karn to find a way to stop the treachery. Just like it's predecessor, Empire of Karn is an Interactive Fiction game with graphics. You can pick up objects and use them to solve puzzles or give orders to your companions to help you in your quest. Unlike most other Interactive Fiction games of the time, Empire of Karn does not allow you to have conversations with NPCs or examine objects. This was the sequel to the 1983 game Heroes of Karn.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Interceptor Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_of_Karn", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT_ruBykZxE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/98454-empire-of-karn\n"}
