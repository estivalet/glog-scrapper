{"altername_name": [], "name": "Platman Worlds", "overview": "Platman Worlds is an exploration platformer game. You play as Platman, who bears a striking resemblance to Pacman, and need to find your way through four different worlds (Classic, Gothic, Ancient and Future). Each world consists of several screens, which contain some enemies (usually ghosts) to be avoided, keys to unlock doors and much food to collect. The screens are connected together in the world and can branch into alternate and optional paths, or require some backtracking after finding a suitable key. This is the commercial homebrew sequel to the original Platman", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2017", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Andrea Schincaglia", "publishers": "Psytronik Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.15", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QALcWWD-b4c", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/124190-platman-worlds\n"}
