{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ninja Carnage", "overview": "Ninja Carnage \u2013 Commodore 64 The game is a 2 disk side adventure game / semi-textual / Point & click / Die & retry. Your mission, to help a Ninja kill the yakuza boss. But there are two problems. First, the Ninja is very \u201cbad ass\u201d. He has a very special sense of humour and he thinks you are a total loser. He is very irreverent. The second problem is that the final boss is hidden very deep in a temple and your trip will lead you through supernatural situations. The gameplay is die and retry, meaning that each error will lead the Ninja to death. There are 29 levels in the game. The texts are more than 10 000 words and there are 128 different deaths for the Ninja. He got reasons to be angry. The game is translated into 7 languages (English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Greek and Polish). The story is based on japanese culture, historical facts and ghost stories. The yokai are supernatural creatures in the japanese folklore. You\u2019ll face many challenges, but I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll both be victorious\u2026or not.
