{"altername_name": [], "name": "Underground (CP Verlag)", "overview": "An Arcade - Collect'em Up style game published in Magic Disk 64 1989/10. Henry is the hero of the game UNDERGROUND, and as befits a real game hero, Henry has a job too. Henry's job is to collect all the stones marked with an EXIT . When all EXIT's have been collected in one screen, Henry goes to the next level. When 8 screens have been completed, our hero is also done, and he can take a short break while the next level is being reloaded from disk (8 screens per level and 26 levels per disk makes a total of 200 screens per disk!!!). Earth: is not a problem for Henry, but holds stones and ally's back. Stones: always fall down, until they hit an obstacle bump. Walls: Can't be moved by anything or anyone. Exits: Like walls, but Henry can collect them. Beds: Like exits, but if Henry has collected one then you can rest for a certain time.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sebastian Richter", "publishers": "CP Verlag", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHFpa-zXqM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/134636-underground-cp-verlag\n"}
