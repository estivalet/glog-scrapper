{"altername_name": ["Space Birds"], "name": "Duel (Pioneer Software)", "overview": "A very Joust-esque game. Joust inspired? An homage to Joust, perhaps. In any case Duel also known as Space Birds or Space-Birds in Italy is a game that will see you perched astride a strange and wonderful battle bird similar to an ostrich that will sway in space and allow you to head towards other, similar birds ridden by your opponents.You will have to hit the opponent properly with the tip of your lance to knock them down. Each time you do this your score will increase, which shows on the counter located on the lower part of the starting platform. You are surrounded by the sea and you cannot lose altitude so as not to end up drowning. A series of platforms give you a place to rest your legs and wings. Going off one side of the screen will have you reappear on the other. Good luck!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Brent Marykuca", "publishers": "Edizione Logica 2000", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/97836-duel-pioneer-software\n"}
