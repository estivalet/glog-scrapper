You start out on a customized cycle. Built with enough speed and power to jump over water and overtake enemies. Then, by finding the right parts along the way, you'll change your cycle into a supercharged, state-of-the-art sports car. Next, add two turbojets to make your car airborne. And take to the skies! Down hyped-up helicopters and jet spaceships from above. And no matter which vehicle you're manning - or who you're after - get ready to stand by for action!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "July 3, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Core Design", "publishers": "Firebird Software", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.33", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_Fighter", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16jkCXeLzuk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/32087-action-fighter\n"}
