A white-robed ninja must kill other ninjas that make their way erratically across the screen, while avoiding their shurikens and nunchakus. Occasionally, a ninja runs across the top of a brick wall and throws shurikens which also must be avoided. A life is lost when the ninja has made contact with other ninjas or their weapon, and the game ends when all lives are lost.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Mastertronic", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/98695-enter-the-ninja\n"}
