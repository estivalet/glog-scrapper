{"altername_name": [], "name": "Out of Deep", "overview": "A one or two player SEUCK based shoot'em up including cooperative play created by Silvio Frattini (SilFrat) and released in Italy in Commodore 64 Club #11 in 1989. Despite our precautions, what man feared for a long time has happened, we don't know how a terminal atomic war broke out, erasing mankind from the face of the planet. Over time some of the remaining beings did have evolved and birds seem to have taken the upper hand, perhaps by virtue of the intelligence developed on the others. But even for them to survive is not easy, on the planet there are in fact androids, mutant animals who, enraged by the events that have occurred, take it out on everything that is different from them. But you will have to try to survive at any cost if you don't want the Earth to go back millennia and therefore struggle strenuously to survive their deadly attacks and reach safety in the open.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Chris Yates", "publishers": "Systems Editoriale", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/160589-out-of-deep\n"}
