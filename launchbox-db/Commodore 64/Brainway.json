{"altername_name": [], "name": "Brainway", "overview": "Brainway is a simple puzzler, very similar to titles such as Sensitive, but where you must destroy all the tiles with purple circles on and without getting stuck or falling. It\u2019s a nice twist on games like Sensitive, and was actually due for release by Genias in 1990. For reasons unknown, it was abandoned, even though it was fully completed.
