{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ultrix (CCI)", "overview": "One of two games on the C64 called Ultrix. This game is a shoot 'em up that was developed by Jonathan Living and published by Commodore Computing International (CCI) in 1988. Jonathan Living again! This time with a Space invaders style arcade game but with the addition of a few cryptic comments. The rules are simple and yet the game is difficult enough for it to be a challenge.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jonathan Living", "publishers": "Commodore Computing International (CCI)", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtVcz1VffaY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/130389-ultrix-cci\n"}
