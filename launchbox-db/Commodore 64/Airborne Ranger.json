{"altername_name": [], "name": "Airborne Ranger", "overview": "The game consists of several missions, in which the player controls a sole Ranger whose objectives include killing an enemy officer, destroying an enemy bunker, taking out a SAM site, and rescuing a captured POW, which would possibly free a roster member that was labeled P.O.W. The game creates the maps and objective locations randomly, so the player is required to plan each mission carefully, because no mission is the same.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "August 1, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "MicroProse Software", "publishers": "Kixx", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airborne_Ranger", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2sKp4Fn7_8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6189-airborne-ranger\n"}
