{"altername_name": [], "name": "Droid Dreams", "overview": "You are a droid on a spaceship bored silly. The only way to escape from the boredom is to sleep and dream of being the hero and saving the day. You play one such dream as a ship is in distress and only you can save it. This is done by collecting objects and placing them in the right place over six levels. As well as enemy droids there are electrodes and bombs in your way. Watch your oil levels which deplete over time but can be topped up along the way. Droid Dreams is a side view horizontally scrolling game where you can move both left and right. The joystick controls your droid while the fire button fires your laser. The screen is split into two. The top half is the playing area while the bottom half includes details like oil level, score and lives.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Shawn Smith", "publishers": "Bug-Byte Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX1HMz8HriE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/97698-droid-dreams\n"}
