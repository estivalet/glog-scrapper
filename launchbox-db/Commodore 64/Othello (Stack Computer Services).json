{"altername_name": [], "name": "Othello (Stack Computer Services)", "overview": "Othello, also called Reversi, is a strategic board game played by two parties on a grid, usually 8x8 but this one is 6x6. The game uses pieces with a white and a dark face, representing the two players' colors. Players lay pieces on the board alternately, one stone at a time. Every piece has to be put at a place where it touches the opponent's stone row of any length, while there is a player's stone at the of the row. All captured stones in between can then be reversed and become the player's color. The only limitation is that the entire row needs to be of a single color and without free spaces. When all pieces are used, the players with more pieces of his color on the board is the winner. This version is intended to be controlled with lightpen technology.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Lightpen Software", "publishers": "Stack Computer Services Ltd.", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "0.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/121427-othello-stack-computer-services\n"}
