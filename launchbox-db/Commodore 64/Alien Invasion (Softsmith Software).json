{"altername_name": ["Alien Invaders", "Alien Invasion"], "name": "Alien Invasion (Softsmith Software)", "overview": "Aliens will descend from space and attempt to land on your planet, if they succeed, one of your three ships will be destroyed. As the aliens approach the surface of your planet they will drop bombs. You must avoid contact by moving your ship left and right. This Space Invaders clone has some comical names for the aliens. Would have been better if there was sound, and without a bug that sometimes causes your ship to explode at the start of a level.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jamie Sampson", "publishers": "Softsmith Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTVp8xutT2s", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86861-alien-invasion-softsmith-software\n"}
