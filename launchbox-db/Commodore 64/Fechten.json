{"altername_name": [], "name": "Fechten", "overview": "Fechten is a German language fencing game for 2 players only. It was developed by Stefan Redlinger and published in Homecomputer 1984/06. There will be a planche. two counting columns, some spectators and the 2 fencers are shown. The point of the game is to hit the opposing fencer as often as possible without being hit yourself. The fencers are controlled using Joystick. Each player can place his fencer in three different positions. In the basic position on the stitch position (push the lever up) and into the defense position (push the lever down). A hit is only possible if a player in trick position hits a player in starting position. If a player in trick position attacks another player and that player still earns a strike before being hit. go into a defensive position, the attacker is practically disarmed. i.e. it automatically goes into the basic position. Now this is the big chance for him defending player to land a hit. by going into the stitch position with lightning speed and trying. to hit the unwalled attacker. Two players meet in trick position. the computer reports \u201cAction Simultaneous\u201d, i.e. neither player receives a point. If there are other clashes between the 2 players (e.g. one player in basic position and the other in defensive position), nothing happens.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Stefan Redlinger", "publishers": "Roeske Verlag", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/158010-fechten\n"}
