{"altername_name": ["Mensch \u00e4rgere Dich nicht", "Mensch \u00e4rgere Dich ein bisschen!"], "name": "Don't Be Angry", "overview": "A computer version of a German board game, created by Wolf Dieter Husch and released in 1995. The name derives from the fact that a peg is sent back to the \"out\" field when another peg lands on it, similar to the later game Sorry!. It is a cross and circle game with the circle collapsed onto the cross, similar to the Indian game Pachisi, the Colombian game Parqu\u00e9s, the American games Parcheesi and Trouble, the French game Jeu des petits chevaux, and the English game Ludo. Like Sorry! the goal is to get all your pegs home and avoid being landed on by other players.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Wolf Dieter Husch", "publishers": "Muekra Datentechnik", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/97009-dont-be-angry\n"}
