{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mental Blocks", "overview": "Mental Blocks consists of three games: Free Fall, or Fits and Pieces, is a 3D version of Tetris. Instead of forming a line, you must form a complete layer before it will disappear. The California Achievement Cubes, or Mental Detector, shows you a cube, and challenges you to figure out which of the four unfolded cubes matches the cube. The single-player version has a timer, while the two player version has you pick the proper cube first. What's Next, Pussycat?, or Shapes Happen, shows you three shapes, and asks you to pick the next shape in the series from a set of four choices. Again, you either face the timer or your friend.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Artech Digital Entertainment", "publishers": "Avantage Software", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYWJCVF-Gtk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/122238-mental-blocks\n"}
