{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cricket Captain (Cult Games)", "overview": "This version of Cricket Captain lacks the ability to play the matches that is featured in the others. Instead, the C64 displays a running scorecard, while on the Spectrum the whole screen is used for a top-down view of the field, with lines illustrating where each shot was played, and flash announcements of dismissals. Only balls from which a player is dismissed or a run is scored are shown. Scouts, coaches and physios are not hired, you simply have a standard one throughout. CPU v CPU matches produce a simple result instead of a full scoreline. Minor counties are not featured; cup tournaments start from the last 16 stage. A few other changes have been made. Player abilities in each field are now rated out of 10 instead of 100, but a player's bowling style and preferred bowling style to bat against are now featured. The scout now brings information about a team's players, and then gives you the chance to buy one of them, instead of searching for players of a particular ability.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Adam Parker", "publishers": "Cult Games", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/94966-cricket-captain-cult-games\n"}
