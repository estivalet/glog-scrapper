{"altername_name": [], "name": "BMX Kidz", "overview": "BMX Kidz is a Commodore 64 game published in 1987 by Firebird Software whose theme is bike / bicycling. It features a action, sports genre and uses a 3rd-person, side view perspective. In this game, the player must compete against five BMX riders in a race against the clock. There are six tracks in the game, complete with stunts and wheelies that the player must accomplish in order to proceed onto the next track. Riding the bike causes energy to be lost, but soda cans can be collected to replenish it. Also, doing stunts causes the player to crash down hard, losing spokes (wheels). Replacement spokes, like the soda cans, can be collected along the way. The game ends when the player does not qualify, runs out of time, or has no spokes left. The game has some similarities to Nintendo's Exitebike.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dave Korn", "publishers": "Firebird Software", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mRZordR6hk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/65765-bmx-kidz\n"}
