{"altername_name": [], "name": "Helden", "overview": "The young up-and-coming magician Rufus has finally decided after long and exhausting considerations to go out into the wide world and become a hero. So he rummages around in his old treasure maps and finally finds exactly what he was desperately looking for: his grandfather's old map of the fabulous, magical diamond. The stupid thing is that this gem has disappeared into the shadow world, and no one has returned alive from there. But Rufus knows no fear, after all, he also wants to be a hero, and so he sets off for the shadow world. On the way there he meets an old, elderly magician who gives him the wise advice to find the four magic crystals first before he takes the diamond. . . You are now taking on the role of Sorcerer's Apprentice Rufus, who has to fight his way through the entangled paths and labyrinths of the shadow world. Of course, you can defend yourself against all the nasty bad guys (ghosts, witches, dwarfs) by using your ZauberSTOCK in port # 2. However, you are unable to fire up or down because you are afraid that the sky will fall on your head as soon as you look up. You also suffer from acute fear of heights, so that you cannot look down, let alone shoot. On the long way through the numerous wrong ways, you will often encounter \"leaking\" skulls. If you touch the liquid, depending on the color of the wet, you get an extra life, invulnerability, etc. Published in Magic Disk 64 1990/03.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "The Power Unit", "publishers": "CP Verlag", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMsutUiil-Y", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/104392-helden\n"}
