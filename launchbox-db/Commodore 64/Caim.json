It balances action, exploration, and puzzles with an emphasis on the narrative. You, an unnamed player, wake up in a strange place without any recollection of how you got there. Explore the facility, avoid deadly hazards and uncover mysteries. As you learn more about the place, the world and yourself, you get ever closer to putting together all the clues and reaching the exit. The music tracks are by unknown composers from HVSC. The story was inspired by The Talos Principle.
