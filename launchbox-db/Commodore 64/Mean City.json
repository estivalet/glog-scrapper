{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mean City", "overview": "In the cities of the world, humans once again have a new battle, after surviving a world wide nuclear war there is a new war against against semi nomad mutants who live outside the cities in the barren wastelands. You take the role of one such mutant named Sante and you have to attempt to enter the city of Concurb 2 G-Gow to rescue your Father, Hante who is the leader of the Tribal Federation of Mutants. Once you manage to enter the city you must find four pieces of a digital key to enter your Father's cell and take him back to your cave outside the city. To make matters worse, your cousin Calte (played by player two or the computer) is also trying to gain entry and find your Father, not to rescue him but to kill him so he can become leader and if he finds you as well he will kill you.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jef.
