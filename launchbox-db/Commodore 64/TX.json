This time we have a new version of the classic PHOENIX ready for you. As you know, PHOENIX is the 3-4 year old game that even the best shooting maniac had to surrender to at some point. The programmer of TX-THE GAME has reissued this goodie, provided it with flawless Digi-Music and added several background graphics. Now everyone can judge for themselves whether the old games were really as bad as some claim. At TX-THE GAME you have 7 spaceships at your disposal to destroy the evil aliens.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "M.
