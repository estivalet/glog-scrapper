{"altername_name": ["Phantomas 2", "Phantomas II"], "name": "Vampire", "overview": "The mission in Vampire is rather obscure. The player must destroy the evil Count Dracula who is devastating the region. The nightmare scenario will be the castle of this malevolent personage. Throughout 95 horrifying rooms the player will be besieged by Dracula's slaves; try to avoid them and obtain the greater amount of food as possible. If the player reunites the five keys and introduce them in its five corresponding bolts, the player will have done a very important part of the mission. In order to obtain each key, the player must find a certain object and fix it in the generator by pedals. If the player does it, the player will be able to jump the enormous pit.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Adrian Sheppard", "publishers": "Codemasters", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantomas_2", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61WbO0MCFLY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/110104-vampire\n"}
