{"altername_name": [], "name": "Berzerk (Arlasoft)", "overview": "Your goal is to clear each screen of robots and then leave via one of the exits, avoiding the electrified walls. Doing so will earn you a bonus, but leaving a screen before all the robots are killed will cause you to be labelled a chicken and forfeit any bonus. As your score increases, the robots' speed and number of bullets they can fire simultaneously will also increase, indicated by their changing colour. In later levels the robots can fire at twice the speed and therefore become extremely deadly. Take too long to clear a screen and 'Evil Otto' will appear, bouncing towards you. He cannot be destroyed so you may need to escape the screen if he gets too close and accept the verbal abuse from the robots. A key tactic is to entice robots to shoot or walk into each other (or walls), and you can also lure Evil Otto to kill robot stragglers or any trapped in a closed-off section of the map. While, the voice samples are a little off, this is far closer to the original arcade in terms of gameplay than 2013's Berzerk Redux is.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "February 13, 2022", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Arlasoft", "publishers": "Arlasoft", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.64", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzXKEUleaXc&t=115s", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/159029-berzerk-arlasoft\n"}
