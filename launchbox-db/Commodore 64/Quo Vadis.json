{"altername_name": ["Quovadis"], "name": "Quo Vadis", "overview": "Quo Vadis is a multi-directional scrolling platform game. The overall goal is to explore the vast chambers and caverns on a quest to retrieve a scepter. Along the way you must battle various varieties of monsters and avoid dangerous lava pits. Your crusader styled character has a projectile weapon that is shot automatically in the direction you are moving. This makes it particularly challenging to defeat monsters as they chase you through the caverns. When the monsters hit you, you lose energy. This is represented by your character's color changing from orange to purple and finally green before you die. Treasure chests can be found which will replenish your health. Falling into a lava pit is instant death. You only have one life and when you run out of energy or fall into a lava pit, it's game over.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Steven T.
