{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bugs Bunny: Private Eye", "overview": "You never should have taken that left turn at Albuquerque! If you did you wouldn't have followed the clues that took you to the abandoned mine. But you can dig your way around and find all the clues...and the carrots! Avoid the spiders and birds and critters and dig down to where things might be hidden. The game consists of Bugs Bunny making his way through a scrolling set of 4 levels, where you had to collect items and carrorts, jumping around platforms. The aim is to find items of evidence on each level, then finally a key to unlock a door at the end of the level. At the end of each level you must catch the culprit on camera using a photograph flash. You also have photo flash abilities to fend of and freeze enemies. Bugs can also dig underground in true Dig Dug style and go into caves, which is quite neat!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "July 26, 1993", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Digital Design", "publishers": "Unreleased Prototype", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHvkolBR3B8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90197-bugs-bunny-private-eye\n"}
