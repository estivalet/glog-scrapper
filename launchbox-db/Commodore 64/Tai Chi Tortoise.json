{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tai Chi Tortoise", "overview": "Vincent Ratatoui isn't nice - EDAM well stole the world's cheeses, and did a GOUDA job of it, making the world a GRUYERE place. Tai-Chi Tortoise goes EMMENTAL, and sets off to retrieve it all. He must travel CAERPHILY through over 100 screens of platform and ladders action, but he's no BABYBEL, and his martial arts training makes him FETA than most, so it can be done. Plenty of objects must be collected en route, and put to use - things such as a spade and jump shoes. Some of the ledges can be stood on, while others disappear when you stand on them (though they all regenerate if you leave and re-enter the screen)", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "David Sowerby", "publishers": "L.K.
