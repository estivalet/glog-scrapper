{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cliff Hanger", "overview": "In the game, different scenes from a Western movie are shot. Either you play the hero \"Cliff Hanger\" on your own, or twosome when his brother \"Coat\" joins in. The aim is, to release an action at the right point of time, to \"kill\" the bandit \"El Bandito\", who runs through the screen (e. g. roll a rock, throw a boomerang, fire a canon, etc.). The scenes are chosen randomly by the program and are repeated until the action was successful. The title of the scene gives a hint to what scene will come up. The game was obviously inspired by the old Looney Toons Roadrunner and Wile E. Coyote cartoons.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "October 1, 1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "New Generation Software", "publishers": "New Generation Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.41", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkb3thB5ilo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/31916-cliff-hanger\n"}
