{"altername_name": [], "name": "Stormbringer (M.A.D.)", "overview": "Stormbringer is the fourth and final game to star Magic Knight, and the only one to make it onto 16-bit systems. Magic Knight must meet with his alter-ego, the Off-White Knight, by reaching his castle hideout - which means clearing 64 screens of adventure. As with the rest of the series, the game uses a largely visual system, in which a press of the fire button calls up a menu of options, such as 'examine', 'pick up' or 'cast spell. Selecting these calls up a sub-menu to choose what should be examined or thrown, which objects to combine, which spells to cast, and so on. The objects to be used include a chicken, a disguise, and eggs. One new feature is that bolts of lightning are fired down at Magic Knight from the sky, and these must be avoided.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Paul Freeman", "publishers": "MAD (Mastertronic Added Dimension)", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormbringer_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hldzzAmEeQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/100927-stormbringer-mad\n"}
