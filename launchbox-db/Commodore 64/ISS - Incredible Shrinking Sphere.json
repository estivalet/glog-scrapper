{"altername_name": [], "name": "ISS: Incredible Shrinking Sphere", "overview": "The Incredible Shrinking Sphere of the title comes under your control in this isometric maze game which has similarities to Marble Madness and Spindizzy. The ball needs to be guided from the start of a level to the end, through 4 linked sections. Various functioning squares must be used to your advantage. Uniquely these include changes to the ball's size, as well as it's physics. Revolving squares randomly fire the ball off in another direction, and ramps shoot you in the current direction at high speed. Weapons can be collected, as can shields - both of which are required to avoid some of the hazards on show. Black holes are always fatal however.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Foursfield", "publishers": "Electric Dreams Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incredible_Shrinking_Sphere", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaHOOCGqRKM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106702-iss-incredible-shrinking-sphere\n"}
