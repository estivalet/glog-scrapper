{"altername_name": [], "name": "1000 Miler v2.0", "overview": "1000 Miler v2.0 is based on the French card games called Mille Bornes. Two players compete against each other to reach 1000 miles before the other. Each player gets seven cards, which can be miles cards for getting closer to your goal or positive or negative cards. Negative cards can be played to cause a flat tire for your opponent, letting him have a crash or other effects. The positive cards can be used to negate the effects of negative cards the opponent played on you. The winning player gets a little winning animation. This version is an updated version of the original 1987 release with improved computer AI for single player games, and a few minor annoying bugs that were in the original were also removed. This version was released on Loadstar #88.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Alan W.
