{"altername_name": [], "name": "Jump Jet", "overview": "Is anyone better placed to write a simulation of a Jump Jet than someone who flies them for a living? With any luck, no - Vaughan Dow is behind this attempt at an accurate recreation of his day job. You can take on one of four statuses, from Flight Lieutenant right up to Group Captain, with a practice mode also included.
