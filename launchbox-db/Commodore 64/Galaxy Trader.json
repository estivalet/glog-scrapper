{"altername_name": [], "name": "Galaxy Trader", "overview": "A primitive space vessel simulation created by Peter R. Boothman and released in Loadstar #189. A full 1541 full of interstellar trade, interspersed with encounters with space bandits. In it you are a galactic middleman. After years of saving you have finally raised enough cash to purchase a stat of the art spaceship. It's 2543 AD and trading can be a a profitable business in the Astron Galaxy. You have 1000 gold pieces and you have purchased an old style laser gun and a standard missile bay with 4 missiles. You start at space station Lazarus. Use the joystick or keyboard to pick menu options. Use the joystick to choose the heading (of 8 directions) and fire or spacebar to engage. Acceleration and deceleration is manual. Use Command to check status of ship and hyperspace drive (if you can ever save up for one). Approach a planet and when the S icon turns white it means you have found a space station in orbit and can trade, refuel, repair or take a shuttle to the planet. You can even refuel your hyperspace drive!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Peter R.
