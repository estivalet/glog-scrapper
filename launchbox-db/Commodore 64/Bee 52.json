{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bee 52", "overview": "You are bee number 52, and you need to collect enough honey every day to fill your quota. But the backyard can be a dangerous place for a bee! Spiders, grasshoppers, assorted bugs, and even lawn sprinklers are all over the place and try to stop bee 52 from reaching the many flowers where honey can be collected. Even after collecting honey, you may need to defend your nest against ants who will try to sneek in and steal honey from you. Bee 52 is armed, however, and can sting or shoot many of the enemies that get in the way. Some levels even have bugs that, when shot, will provide bee 52 with more powerful firepower temporarily. Bee 52 is a side scrolling shooter which can be played by one or two players.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Rave Computer Programming", "publishers": "Codemasters Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfEzY2h5HVg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/88264-bee-52\n"}
