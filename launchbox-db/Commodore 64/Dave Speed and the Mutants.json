Creatures threaten to hurt Dave wherever he goes, but Dave can stomp on these creatures to destroy them. Eating chicken legs along the way will cause Dave to be angry, allowing him to destroy creatures by just walking into them. Some creatures will leave fruit behind when they are destroyed, and getting them will increase Dave's energy. There are rings scattered everywhere he goes, and collecting 100 of these rings results in an extra life.
