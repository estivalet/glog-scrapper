{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Black Box", "overview": "In Black Box there is an 8x8 grid which contains several atoms hidden in it. Your job is to find the location of all of the atoms by projecting rays from the side of the box and observing what happens. If a ray directly hits an atom it will be absorbed. Rays that pass within one box of an atom will be reflected. After you have fired enough rays, you can venture a guess as to an atoms location. To help prevent random guessing you lose points for a ray that completely misses an atom or an incorrect guess about the atoms location, and gain points for rays that are absorbed or reflected and for a correct guess. If you get stumped you can end the game early and peek at the location of all atoms.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jeff Lomax", "publishers": "MicroSpec", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75489-the-black-box\n"}
