{"altername_name": [], "name": "Deflection", "overview": "In Deflection the goal is to hit different targets with a ball. The player can deflect the path of the ball by placing deflectors. The ball normally travels in straight lines and when reaching the edge of the screen it will reappear at the other side again, only one row lower. Using the deflectors the ball can be redirected up and down again. The deflectors are placed at the current location of the ball, so timing is important. The game ends if the ball reaches the bottom of the screen.
