{"altername_name": [], "name": "Heroes of Karn", "overview": "A long time ago, before the rise of the empire of Karn, evil creatures attacked the lands of Beren, the last of the Mountain Kings. Only four men, who would become known as the four heroes of Karn, survived the massacre and managed to flee. However, they were soon caught and put under a spell. The player takes on the role of the legendary Stranger from \"a land where men can fly and machines can think\", and must rescue the four heroes and retrieve the treasures of the realm. Heroes of Karn is an Interactive Fiction game with graphics and more unusually, music. You can type in commands to manipulate objects, solve puzzles or attack enemies. While it is not possible to have conversations with NPCs, you can give them orders to do certain tasks.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ian Gray", "publishers": "Interceptor Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Heroes_Of_Karn", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/98455-heroes-of-karn\n"}
