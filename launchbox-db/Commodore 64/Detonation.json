{"altername_name": [], "name": "Detonation", "overview": "Evil Koloccan terrorists have planted numerous bombs throughout the sacred temple of Remkcalb. They have also impregnated the temple walls with a substance connected to the detonating device, and placed vaporous swirls of energy protecting each room in the temple in which a bomb is placed. You have been selected to try to save the temple from destruction because of your knowledge of explosive devices and your athletic prowess. Time is of the essence, as the temple will be destroyed in less than eight minutes after the fuse is lit. Your mission is to enter each room of the temple, retrieve the bombs, and take them to your containment room, where you will defuse them. This will clear one level of the temple. Do this II times and you will have saved the temple.
