{"altername_name": ["Spy vs Spy II: The Island Caper"], "name": "Spy vs Spy: The Island Caper", "overview": "A follow-up to the first Spy vs Spy game now sees the spies stranded on a desert island. This time, instead of the four items which allow you to leave for the airport, the spies must try to collect three pieces of a missile and escape from the island in a waiting submarine before a volcano erupts. There are a few pitfalls to avoid such as quicksand and sharks. There are also new traps (hidden pits, napalm, snares and a pistol) and hand-to-hand combat is done with swords instead of clubs.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "July 1, 1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "First Star Software", "publishers": "Databyte/Beyond", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.26", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spy_vs._Spy_II:_The_Island_Caper", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VHcil26nTc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6207-spy-vs-spy-the-island-caper\n"}
