Featuring a fully built level editor for creating your own versions. in Invert, you are a Blob that has been kidnapped by a flying monster and thrown into a cell in Puzzle Land. In an attempt to escape from the cell, you must complete all 32 puzzles inside. All black, inverted tiles in the play area must be INVERTED back to their normal state within the time limit. This may sound simple enough, but you are not alone. Monsters (Chatters) are out to stop you from completing the puzzle. They run around the perimeter of the outer rim of the cell. At times they will feel like throwing bombs. So you must not only restore all inverted tiles, but do so while defending yourself from the Chatters. The tiles in the game vary on some levels.
