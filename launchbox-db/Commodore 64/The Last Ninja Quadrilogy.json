{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Last Ninja Quadrilogy", "overview": "Classics from the Past! A title that should not be missed if you wish to experience Retrogaming at its finest.(Maybe Im biased?) Last Ninja was initially developed for the C64 and later to many computers like ZX Spectrum, Atari, Amiga and even PCs. So successful it led to 2 more sequels and a Remix. Now you can experience all 4 titles in 1 cartridge. The plot is simple for these titles, you play ninja Armakuni ordered to assassinate an evil shogun Kunitoki at his castle (Last Ninja), then travel through time to 20th century to fight him again (Last Ninja 2) and finally at his retreat hideout in Tibet.(Last Ninja 3) The Last Ninja is a beautiful game with good music and features a blend of exploration, puzzle solving, and combat gameplay. Like old computers, these are not easy games (Damm the rocks in the river) but completing it is rewarding.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "May 9, 2018", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "", "developers": "System 3 Software Ltd.", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/368222-the-last-ninja-quadrilogy\n"}
