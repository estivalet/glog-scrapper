{"altername_name": [], "name": "On The Farm", "overview": "You are a sheep who has just escaped from his pen and is running riot around various fields on the farm. Help your sheep chomp on all of Farmer Dave's crops (which will make him and his workers more angry) to advance on to the very next level. Avoid colliding into the animals. If you bump into an animal - 3 strikes and you're out. You can jump on the animals to score points, but watch out for Farmer Dave (Yellow) and his working farmers. You can't jump on him or his colleagues, otherwise you get caught (and a life is lost). Watch out for those magic mushrooms. If you let your sheep eat one of those, it will go high, and a life will be lost. You will also be against the clock as well. Good luck sheep.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2010", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Achim Volkers", "publishers": "The New Dimension (TND)", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75996-on-the-farm\n"}
