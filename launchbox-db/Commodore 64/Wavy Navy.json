{"altername_name": [], "name": "Wavy Navy", "overview": "Battle 30-foot waves, enemy fighter jets, bombers, and helicopters while dodging mines in this Galaxian clone that has a few novel twists. Your P.T. Boat can be moved left or right and can fire missiles to bring down enemy aircraft, but it also moves up and down, staying on the surface of the huge, slow-moving waves. Wavy Navy is a 1983 computer game designed by Rodney McAuley for the Apple II and published by Sirius Software. Atari 8-bit family and Commodore 64 versions were released the same year. Wavy Navy is a nautically themed fixed shooter with left and right controls to move the player's PT boat, but there is an additional vertical element as the boat moves up and down with the large ocean waves that scroll beneath it. The direction and speed of the waves vary per level.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Rodney McAuley", "publishers": "", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.75", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavy_Navy_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjfcGojidoY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/96925-wavy-navy\n"}
