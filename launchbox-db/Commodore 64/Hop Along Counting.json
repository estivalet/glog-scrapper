All that children need is a little encouragement, and their natural curiosity about numbers will take over. They'll love sending Mommy rabbit around the field to find the correct number of baby bunnies. They'll be proud when they lead the bunnies to the matching burrow and watch them hope one by one into their bunny beds.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ravi Romano", "publishers": "Fisher-Price Learning Software", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrmM3upfj1E", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/117851-hop-along-counting\n"}
