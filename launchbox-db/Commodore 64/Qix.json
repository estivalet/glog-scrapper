{"altername_name": [], "name": "Qix", "overview": "The objective of Qix is to fence off, or claim, a supermajority of the playfield. At the start of each level, the playing field is a large, empty rectangle, containing the \"Qix\"\u2014a stick-like entity that performs graceful but unpredictable motions within the confines of the rectangle, and you can either draw these rectangles fast or slow. Drawing the rectangles using the \"slow\" method awards you the most points. Once a rectangle has been made, it will be colored in to show that you have claimed your territory. While drawing the rectangles, you need to watch out for Qix (pronounced \"kicks\"), a series of colored lines that crawl the screen. In addition to Qix, you also need to avoid the Sparks who travel around the border, as well as any lines that you have made, as well as The Fuse, who travels along the line that you are drawing. Once you have claimed enough territory, you proceed to the next level.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Alien Technology Group", "publishers": "Taito", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.30", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qix", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyEzhntx9dY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/111896-qix\n"}
