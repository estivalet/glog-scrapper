{"altername_name": [], "name": "Strip Darts: Knockout Tournament", "overview": "You and a friend challenged each other to a game of darts at the local pub, but this no ordinary game of darts! Because of the consumption of too much alcohol, you decide to challenge a friend to play darts WITH A DIFFERENCE and he accepts. What a dumbass. You have a choice of a 301 or a 501 game. You will play against the computer. Every time you throw three darts, you will lose points from the board. Then it is the computer's turn. To win the game. If you lose all the points, the computer takes off clothes, but if you lose then you have to suffer the consequences. :)", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "April 30, 2003", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Richard Bayliss", "publishers": "The New Dimension (TND)", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/130781-strip-darts-knockout-tournament\n"}
