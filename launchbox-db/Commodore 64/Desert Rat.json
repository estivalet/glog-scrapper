{"altername_name": [], "name": "Desert Rat", "overview": "The mid-day sun beats down on you, as you scan the dunes for any sign of enemy tanks or troops. It's not easy to see; the sun glares on the crystal sand, creating waves of shimmering light which play tricks on the eyes. But you must concentrate, for it would be disastrous to be ambushed in the middle of the wide open plains which surround you. Suddenly, you see movement on a distant hill top. It's the enemy, massing for an attack. You leap into your desert vehicle as they spot you. What follows is a non-stop, high-speed desert battle, where shells fly overhead and blast into tanks, leaving them tangled masses of molten steel, graves in the middle of a distant, forgotten graveyard. The object of the game is to rescue as many of your men as you can in 3 minutes. If you come within 2 steps of any man, he will follow you to H.Q., where you can save your points. If you run into a mine, you'll be patched up and placed back into the H.Q. tent. If one of your men is hit, they will move to the left of the screen. Use the fire button to release your man after you've gotten him to H.Q.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "General Masters Corporation", "publishers": "ALA Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/96454-desert-rat\n"}
