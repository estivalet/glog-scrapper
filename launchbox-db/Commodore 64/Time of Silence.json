{"altername_name": ["Zeit der Stille"], "name": "Time of Silence", "overview": "Second place winner in the Forum64 Adventure Competition 2015, written by Claus. The game is an Adventure RPG with high grade music and smooth scrolling as you try to survive using unique abilities in a world overcome by disease and decay. The game is superb, with a refreshing top view perspective. You walk the hero around, and you can interact with people and objects using the menu that shows up when you hit the joystick fire button close to the person or object. The background music also helps to give the tone to the game. What is most amazing is that Claus is responsible for all components of the game: coding, graphics and music. Also the game is available in German and English, NTSC and PAL. The game also allows you to save and restore at any time, a nice and important addition to this type of game.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2015", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Claus", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AfIhcrJwU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/244881-time-of-silence\n"}
