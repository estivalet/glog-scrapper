{"altername_name": [], "name": "Beppe Kid", "overview": "A horizontally scrolling western themed shooter published in Special Program N\u00b043 (05/1988) supplement: RUN/STOP The 64 Magic Games N\u00b01and in Hit Parade 64 N\u00b065 (03/1992). In 2016 Hokuto Force rereleased the game with many, many fixes. Let's do a long jump into the past to reach the Old West where you will find our hero: Beppe Kid. The starting place is a fort, from this you need to reach the castle where a diamond lies. The path that leads to the castle is very dangerous, in fact, many birds of prey and some natives won't hesitate to attack you. Shoot them with your Colt, but fire sparingly because the shots are counted, or avoid the clash with the birds by jumping upward. If you reach the castle, get off your horse and venture inside the labyrinth of rooms, one of them hides the diamond. Collect five keys to move between floors. To access the room of the diamond you will need to compose a word formed of 6 letters, the letters are dispersed amongst the rooms. Ammo is scarce, so conserve as much as possible. You may find some in the castle if you are lucky. The game ends when you return the diamond to the fortress.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Edizioni Societ\u00e0 SIPE", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZpnv1AJ_I0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164881-beppe-kid\n"}
