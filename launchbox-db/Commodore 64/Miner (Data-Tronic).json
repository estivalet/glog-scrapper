Unlike most Boulder Dash clones on the Commodore 64, this one was built from the ground up, and not made using the Boulder Dash Construction Kit. Berg programmed the game using just green, black, and some white to make it look as if it was done on a monochrome computer such as the Commodore PET.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "\u00d8ystein Berg", "publishers": "Data-Tronic", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/122403-miner-data-tronic\n"}
