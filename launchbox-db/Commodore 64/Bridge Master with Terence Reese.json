The game is highly customizable, supporting different bidding conventions, game types, and several \"player personalities\" - meaning you can set the game style of your computer opponents (active, passive, trump-waster, etc.).", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "J.
