{"altername_name": [], "name": "Galax-i-Birds", "overview": "In this Galaxian-style shooter, players control a ship who must dodge wave upon wave of birds such as vultures, chickens, swans, and budgies. Ships can move left or right, and fire two shots at a time. In each wave, birds fly into players in a kamikaze attempt to destroy your ship. Players proceed to the next wave when all birds in the current have been killed. Lives are lost when birds make contact with their ship, and the game ends when all lives have been lost.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sensible Software", "publishers": "Firebird Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.56", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79BbzCaJByE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/101911-galax-i-birds\n"}
