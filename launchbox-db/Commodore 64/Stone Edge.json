{"altername_name": [], "name": "Stone Edge", "overview": "An arcade style puzzle game created by S\u00f6ren Kress & Jim Nowak, with music by Markus Schneider, it was published by Markt & Technik in both 64'er Sonderheft 66, and in Game On 1993/02. Two explorers land in unknown dimensions of time. Help them both find the time barrier so they can get return the present. In the year 2668, a much more convenient way of traveling to distant galaxies has long since been used: A special space capsule is bombarded with energy beams from the beam disintegrator at the A.T.I (Astral Travel Institute) until the probe is back in the desired solar system shows up. In this way, distances of light years can be overcome in a matter of seconds. However, this procedure has an undesired side effect: you end up in a non-predeterminable time dimension and have to try to reach the next time hole. The necessary time correction can then be made at any time with suitable instruments. The way to the time hole is paved with blocks of energy that you have to navigate with the probe on the correct course - otherwise you end up in nothing! Accompany the chrononauts on their way to safety!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Twice Effect Productions", "publishers": "M&T Software Partner International GmbH", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/159248-stone-edge\n"}
