{"altername_name": [], "name": "Frog Master", "overview": "A game based on the work of the notorious B. F. Skinner, wherein he demonstrated that it is possible to \"shape\" the behavior of animals by rewarding them for doing what you want them to do. This principle, applied to a game with the elements of both football and rugby, and is the basis for Frog Master. This game is designed for either one or two players and has over 100 different variations to allow you to play a relatively straightforward or a wildly complex and challenging game, or somewhere in between. The playing field for Frog Master has goal lines at both ends of the field and goal areas in the center of each line. But the resemblance to any normal sports competition ends there. You train the on screen animal players by clicking when they do something you want them to do when they move \"randomly\" at the beginning and as you click the animal team players as they move how you want you will slowly get the tadpoles and frogs moving the way you desire.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Michael F.C.
