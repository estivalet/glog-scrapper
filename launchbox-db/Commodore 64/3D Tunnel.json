{"altername_name": [], "name": "3D Tunnel", "overview": "3D Tunnel is a first-person shooter where you must move down a constantly moving tunnel, which moves in multiple directions, over various phases to escape. As you move through the tunnel you must shoot a certain amount of various creatures including bats, frogs and rats, that come towards you, to move to the next phase. If you hit the walls then you lose one of the ten initial lives, and when they are gone then it is game over. The last phase has no shooting, you just have to avoid various underground trains that hurtle towards you. You are able to practise any phase and there are three speeds to select from (Slow, Medium and Fast).
