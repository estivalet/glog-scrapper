{"altername_name": ["Super Stuntman"], "name": "Super Stunt Man", "overview": "This action shoot \u2018em up has an unusual setting, pitching you as a movie stuntman trying to complete the toughest scenes of the latest blockbuster. The scenes include desert chases, forest rallying and Grand Canyon jumps. There are 7 levels in total, each teeming with \u2018bad guys\u2019 and scenery obstacles. You score points for each enemy you shoot down. Unusually, you get bonuses for crashing anything up to twice (as this can be perceived to maximise the action stakes for the film), but a third crash means Game Over.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Neil G.
