{"altername_name": [], "name": "Maze Dash", "overview": "This is a game I created for the Commodore 64 using the cc65 C cross compiler toolset. I wrote it in just a few days. I asked my son to describe a game to me that I should make, and this is more or less what he described. Of course, he had in mind something modern in 3D but I wanted to make it in less than a week and for the Commodore 64. You play as secret agent Mr. White. Your mission is to collect all the intelligence dots. Dot get caught by the guards. Shoot guards only when you have no other choice. Use boosts to outrun the guards when possible. You get one point per microdot, 10 points for unused boosts and 100 point for every unused bullet. 2 Play modes. Survival where you have no gun and Escape where you have a gun but there are less escape routes.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2014", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Stefan Wessels", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knBh9mtK4Ss", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/122007-maze-dash\n"}
