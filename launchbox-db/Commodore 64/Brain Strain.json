{"altername_name": [], "name": "Brain Strain", "overview": "This is a game for one or two player, sort of based on Coined by Slash Design, but instead of taking away coins, you take away numbers. The game starts where you have a pot with the total number of credits. Either yourself, your opponent or a computer will take it in turns to take a chosen number of credits away. If you are left with 4 credits, and can take them all away, you will win. However if you are left with LESS than 4 credits left in the pot, then you will forefit the round. The winner is the first player to score 3 points.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2007", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Richard Bayliss", "publishers": "The New Dimension (TND)", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90028-brain-strain\n"}
