As you can see by the screenshot, the game engine is taken from the original Boulderdash game. The 50 levels were created in Boulderdash Construction Kit, and they should pose a massive challenge! The difficulty level is set very high, especially from level 20 and upwards. * A player roster where total score, highest level reached and some statistics are stored separately for each player. * Each level has a top 30 high score list, including statistics for number of times each level has been played and won. * 50 furiously challenging levels, the most difficult Boulderdash levels available for the C64 that are depending on puzzle skill rather than luck.
