You steer a tank through a maze full of traps and enemies and you have to find the seven parts of a machine called Hypercom there. The tank has only limited ammunition, but there are ammunition depots in the labyrinth that refresh the supply once. Collisions with objects, including the walls, are fatal unless they are depots or teleporter fields.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Lippe Enterprises", "publishers": "Eurogold", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/123756-terror-tank\n"}
