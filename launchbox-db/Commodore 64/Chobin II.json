The fantastic adventure of our Chobin begins right by the sea one spring morning. While he was thinking of the strangest things as usual, he was disturbed by a noise, so he stood up and went to the source of this noise, at that point he found a barrel that pushed by the waves of the sea continues to crash upon the rocks. He picked up the bottle and saw that it contained a message, opened it and found a parchment bearing the following sentence: Bring the right object before the king's throne of the Turks and you will be rewarded with a stupendous treasure. Chobin did not have it repeated twice and immediately began his fantastic journey with his boat.
