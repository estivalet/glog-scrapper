{"altername_name": [], "name": "Calhoon's Chocolate Challenge", "overview": "A puzzle game attributed to Knees Calhoun and published in Loadstar #130 in 1995. Knees' latest challenge involves several tons of delicous dark chocolate, a 6x6 grid and one fiendinsh rule. Like some of the other Challenge games, this one has both a Challenge mode and a Tournament mode. The Challenge is a special puzzle to solve and the Tournament is a never-ending random board layout. The maneu allows you to move a highlight bar with the cursor keys or a joystick in port#2. ON the 6x6 board elements are connected by diagonal lines. Each circular element represents number of dons of deep, dark, semi-sweet chocolate. The kind used in Peter Paul's Mounds. The numbers range from 1 to 6, with the layout always being the same. Your task is to select as many of the elements as you wish, trying to amass as many tons of the delicious brown goo as you can. There is only one catch, you can only take one batch per diagonal line. Move the white cursor with the keys or joystick and press return or fire to select a batch. The chosen number becomes white. To de-select just press fire on the number again. The computer will not allow you to choose two batches on teh same diagonal line. Each time you select something your score is updated in the medium grey box at the bottom right of the screen. The current TOP scoreis shown in the left part of the scorebox by the holder of that score just below. Original game idea from a book by Henry Dudeny where it was called Tom Tiddler's Ground.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Knees Calhoon", "publishers": "Softdisk Publishing, Inc.", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90254-calhoons-chocolate-challenge\n"}
