{"altername_name": ["Mosaico"], "name": "The Slicker Puzzle", "overview": "The Slicker Puzzle is a puzzle game that is played on a 16 by 16 grid that show a pattern. Each square of the grid contains two triangles: one that is black and one that is of another colour. After choosing a skill level the grid is shuffled and the player's task is to recreate the original pattern of the grid. This is done by moving lines either vertically or horizontally. For each move made a line is moved one step down or to the right. If the puzzle is completed within the correct number of moves then a coded message will be displayed. By completing the eight skill level the message is decoded.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Graham Pointer", "publishers": "dk'tronics", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKcGuAqixRM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/122972-the-slicker-puzzle\n"}
