{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pea Picker", "overview": "In this collect 'em up developed and published by C.P. White, you must go around in a maze collecting green peas. Watch out for the giant pea monster (more like a green Pac-Man ghost in terms of its resemblance) or he will eat you. You can break the swinging doors by moving at the same time as the giant pea, but he will soon repair them. Eat him when he turns a nice juicy red color.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "C.P. White", "publishers": "C.P.
