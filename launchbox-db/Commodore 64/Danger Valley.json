{"altername_name": [], "name": "Danger Valley", "overview": "Danger Valley is action game developed by Oliver M\u00fclhens & Thorsten Blaudeck and published in Input 64 1988/06. As soon as we start looking for the treasure, we have to make a decision: take the sword in our hands or grab the offered key. And if you encounter a monster at this very moment, you will experience tense seconds. How everything begins... Our game is an exciting combination of graphic adventure, animation and tinkering, and the maze also doesn't neglect memory training. The starting point here, as with every maze adventure (maze doesn't mean club, that would be Mace, but maze) is the home of a nice young man, which is reminiscent of a small edition of such castles like they were built for prince charming. The portal is already closed and our Count is on his way to the treasure chest. But please don't think that the game is over when he finds the box, oh no, then the dangers become even greater. The goal is only reached when the young prince or you (!) has found the box and brought it home safely. So remember the path well, especially the one that leads back to your home castle. On the way to the treasure and back there are a lot of dangers: firstly there is the great danger of getting lost, then the no less great torment that you will be on the road too long and starving, and thirdly the danger of one of the numerous medusae to fall victim to.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Oliver M\u00fclhens", "publishers": "Verlag Heinz Heise GmbH", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/95668-danger-valley\n"}
