{"altername_name": ["Vegas Casino II"], "name": "Vegas Casino 2", "overview": "After Vegas Casino, its sequel Vegas Casino 2 was released in two different formats \u2013 on 3.5\u2033 floppy disk for the PC and as a dual format 5.25\u2033 floppy disk for the Commodore 64 and PC. Both games were exclusively released in America. This brought more traditional casino games to the Mastertronic range for the 8-bit machines for the first time. Despite both games shipping on disk and thus having the potential to offer far more than the earlier cassette releases seen, they were relatively limited in terms of what they offered and it did disappoint somewhat.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Robert B.
