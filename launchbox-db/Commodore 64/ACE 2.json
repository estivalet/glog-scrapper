{"altername_name": ["ACE II"], "name": "ACE 2", "overview": "A follow-up to ACE. Similar to its predecessor, ACE 2 is an oldie head-to-head air combat flight sim set in modern days of aviation. The game has a very strong arcade feel, as all the missions you fly are nondescript or generic. Your plane is also a generic, hypothetical modern fighter, and the goal is to fly different sorties to kill enemy aircraft. Very similar to ACE, except that you can now play a 2-player hotseat game, or solo competition against the computer, in split-screen mode.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Cascade Games", "publishers": "Cascade Games", "genres": "Flight Simulator", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.35", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_2_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2VNuIfBLxQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6394-ace-2\n"}
