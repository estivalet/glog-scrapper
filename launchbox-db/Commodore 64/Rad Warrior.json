{"altername_name": ["The Sacred Armour of Antiriad", "Antiriad", "La Armadura Sagrada De Antiriad"], "name": "Rad Warrior", "overview": "In 2086, civilization destroys itself in a nuclear Armageddon, as two factions who both develop an anti-radiation battlesuit completely immune to conventional weapons go to war against each other when diplomatic peace talks break down. In the following millennia, the survivors develop into a hardy but peaceful race, living a quiet agricultural existence. One day, mysterious alien forces emerge from an old volcano containing a prewar military base and attack, quickly conquering and enslaving the new breed of humans, and forcing the populace to work in mines. Many rebel against the mysterious overlords and one of these rebels, Tal, is instructed by his elders to seek-out a legendary armoured suit - the Sacred Armour of Antiriad (the last word being a corruption of \"anti-radiation\"), which is in fact one of the prewar battlesuits whose development originally instigated the diplomatic crisis that started the nuclear war. This armour is rumoured to render the wearer impervious to attack and, with its help, Tal hopes to defeat and overthrow the alien rulers of Earth.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Palace Software", "publishers": "Beau-Jolly", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.88", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sacred_Armour_of_Antiriad", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agknKDCECMc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6223-rad-warrior\n"}
