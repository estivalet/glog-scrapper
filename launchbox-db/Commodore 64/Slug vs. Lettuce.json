{"altername_name": [], "name": "Slug vs. Lettuce", "overview": "The idea of this game is to jump from platform to platform and eat lettuce for points, of which the lettuce appears at random in the cave. The slug must also watch out for the falling droplets, which will make it lose a life. After the loss of the last life, the slug will explode, and you will carry the total number of points as your final score. You will have 10 minutes to survive and score as many points as possible. What is the chance of you achieving a hi score?", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "November 26, 2022", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Richard Bayliss", "publishers": "Scene World Magazine", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhZQKukbFQU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/167681-slug-vs-lettuce\n"}
