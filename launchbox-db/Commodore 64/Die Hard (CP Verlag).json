{"altername_name": [], "name": "Die Hard (CP Verlag)", "overview": "This one isn't a Christmas game, this is the *other* version, a tank duel game created by Andre Ducree and published in Magic Disk 64 1990/08. Just one thing about the game: dismantle the enemy tank before it dismantles you! You steer the bowl as usual, only this time the fire button has two meanings: A short press gives the enemy the grenade, while a long press the driver jumps into the fresh air for a round, for example. B. from the gas station at the bottom of the screen to cart a spare canister of gasoline. As soon as the hubby's corner flashes, the canister is bunkered and it's home. The ammunition supply works in exactly the same way. At the top of the screen is another workshop where you can bring your heart back into shape. Just drive on it and the damage level will drop. Of course \"DIE HARD\" is a baller orgy for two Freds. Fred 1 with the joystick in port # 2 rolls the green tank from the left, Fred 2 in port # 1 with the red one from the right. The indications available to each maniac are SCORE, FUEL, AMMO. and DAMAGE and hardly need to be explained in more detail. So, since after the games described above, saliva drips out of the mouth of every real shooting maniac with joy, that's the end of it", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Andre Ducree", "publishers": "CP Verlag", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.14", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/96520-die-hard-cp-verlag\n"}
