{"altername_name": [], "name": "Oregon Trail", "overview": "The program simulates a trip over the Oregon Trail from Independence, Missouri, to Oregon City, Oregon, in the year 1847. Your family will cover the 2040 mile Oregon Trail in 5-6 months if you make it alive. You have saved $900, a small fortune, to spend for the trip and you've just paid $200 for a dependable wagon. You will need to spend the rest of your money on items that can help you make it alive to the end of the trail: Oxen, food, ammunition, clothing and miscellaneous supplies to treat sickness and for emergency repairs. So here is a great port of the version 2 source material (Creative Computing 1978-05) to the Commodore 64 computer. Almost identical in display layout (if not colors) to a similar Atari 8-bit port. Although it still closely hews to the source listing, being a BASIC implementation, the programmers for this version decided to try improvements to the status page that occurs after each turn. Very nice.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1978", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "MECC", "publishers": "Creative Computing", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oregon_Trail_(1971_video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_v98_Pa1TU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/130435-oregon-trail\n"}
