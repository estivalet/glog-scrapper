{"altername_name": [], "name": "Stickybear Town Builder", "overview": "The game starts with a green expanse of land, awaiting development. The player selects different kinds of buildings to erect on the site, which the game instantly builds and automatically connects with roads. Then, in the two play modes, the player gets to navigate a little car through the lanes and byways, as on a top-town map, trying to situate the car on a map location or at the site of a hidden key described only in cardinal directions (go south! now south-east!).", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Optimum Resource, Inc.", "publishers": "Weekly Reader Family Software", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/130626-stickybear-town-builder\n"}
