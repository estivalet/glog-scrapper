BYB, of Hokuto Force, fixed the randomizer and allowed the game to present every possible puzzle in addition to improving the fastloader. After finishing a complete games round, puzzles used are saved together with the highscore to disk, meaning your next game and the following ones won't repeat for a very long time. A computer version of the popular game show Wheel Of Fortune, where you guess letters until you can guess the phrase. Three old-school rounds of Wheel of Fortune (where the puzzles are simply \"Phrase\", \"Title\", \"Person\", etc.) and then a bonus round. You can compete against 2 computer players or up to three people can play against each other.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "May 29, 2021", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "BYB", "publishers": "", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "3", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/152066-wheel-of-fortune-hf-special-edition\n"}
