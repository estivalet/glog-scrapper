{"altername_name": [], "name": "Climber!", "overview": "Computer Gamer 1985/12 (Issue #09). The publishing of this game was as interesting as playing the game itself. The idea behind Climber! is to climb around a grid collecting the diamonds and avoiding the spiders and gaps in the grid, but the game was distributed on a 7 inch 33 and 1/3 RPM flexi record that you played on a record player and recorded to a tape. This allowed a flat magazine publication with some of the advantages of tape publications and no need for the user to type in a program.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Frank G.
