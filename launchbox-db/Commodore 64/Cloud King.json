{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cloud King", "overview": "Cloud King was developed in 2001 by Andrea Canobbio using Sensible Software's Shoot 'em Up Construction Kit. It was also entered into the 2003 SEUCK Compo with some minor graphical tweaking, which eventually lead the game to go on and win that year's compo, barely beating out the second place finisher (Renovator) by a 2 point margin. Explore the cloud kingdom and face many deadly monsters in this cute action vertically scrolling shoot 'em up construction kit game.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2001", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Andrea Canobbio", "publishers": "Anatomika", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWhPkS0BiOc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/125500-cloud-king\n"}
