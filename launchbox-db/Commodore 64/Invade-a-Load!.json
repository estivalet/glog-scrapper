{"altername_name": [], "name": "Invade-a-Load!", "overview": "Invade-a-Load was a fast loader routine used in software for Commodore 64 computer. It was used in commercial computer games that were stored on Compact Cassette tape and loaded using the Datacassette. Invade-a-Load allowed the user to play a small clone of the famous Space Invaders game while the main game was loading. This initial minigame was loaded in under a minute, providing entertainment while waiting for the actual game to load, which could take a further five to ten minutes. On at least one occasion, a reviewer expressed their preference for Invade-a-Load over the main game itself. It mostly appeared in games sold in the United Kingdom, as, by the time it was written, the Commodore market in the United States had mostly switched to floppy disk media.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Richard Aplin", "publishers": "SilverTime", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.36", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzdhcZzbzvM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106589-invade-a-load\n"}
