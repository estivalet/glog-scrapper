{"altername_name": ["Trapfall"], "name": "Cuthbert in the Jungle", "overview": "Trapfall, or as it is known on the Commodore 64 / Dragon 32, Cuthbert in the Jungle, is a direct clone of Activision's classic Pitfall. In a red, blue, yellow and green jungle, your hero (Cuthbert) must run through the landscape, avoiding falling into lakes (some of which appear out of nothing, only to disappear again), being crushed by rolling logs, being bit by snakes, scorpions or other dangerous creatures of the jungle. In the lakes live crocodiles, which can be used as stepping stones as long as their jaws are closed. In order to cross lakes, lianas may also be used, Tarzan-style. For some reason, there is a big cellar beneath the jungle into which Cuthbert may fall. It may be used as a way to avoid the dangers on the surface, but it is also inhabited by nasties, and you may run into a cul-de-sac. To spice things up, you only have 20 minutes to reach the end.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Steve Bak", "publishers": "Microdeal", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ornB1VpUWuI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/33385-cuthbert-in-the-jungle\n"}
