{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tass Times in Tonetown", "overview": "Your grandfather has invented a device which makes real everything he can see in his dream. All the strange places and creatures he can dream about really exist in an alternate reality. One of those creatures, named Franklin Snarl, traveled through the device to our reality and kidnapped Gramps, teleporting him into the crazy world of Tonetown. He hopes that Gramps will always remain asleep, which assures Snarl's own existence! Now it's up to you, the hero of the game to travel to the alternate dimension of Tonetown and to rescue your grandfather. You interact with the environment by either typing in commands, or choosing one of the action icons available as interface. The game, therefore, combines text-based interaction with the more modern \"point and click\" approach.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Brainwave Creations", "publishers": "Activision", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.33", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tass_Times_in_Tonetown", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FfRPm48FCU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/89101-tass-times-in-tonetown\n"}
