{"altername_name": [], "name": "Zolyx", "overview": "Zolyx is a Qix variant: the player is presented with a white playing field and controls a pixel. Whenever this pixel moves over the playfield, it leaves a line behind - and when the line becomes a closed form, it gets coloured. The goal is to colour 75% of the playfield; everything above gives bonus points for the high score list. Well, it is not that easy. White pixels fly around the field and touching them result in death; similarly deadly is going backwards on a line. At least the player has two tricks to help himself: he can change the direction of the white pixels by pressing a button (limited) and jail them when drawing a closed line around them. This is possible because the pixels are either confined to the coloured or uncoloured parts. After finishing a level a new one starts with three changes: one more white pixel, an extra life for the player and one additional usage of the \"direction change\" button.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Zolt\u00e1n Tass", "publishers": "Beau-Jolly", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.58", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac4k_BKXO7w", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/79361-zolyx\n"}
