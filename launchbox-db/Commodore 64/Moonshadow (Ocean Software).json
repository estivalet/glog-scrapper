{"altername_name": ["Jet Trooper", "Astroenergy"], "name": "Moonshadow (Ocean Software)", "overview": "This game was the precursor to Zone Trooper, but many, many changes were made to it and the music and graphics in the latter game were different in multiple ways. Where Zone trooper would mostly be described as shooter, this game was more of a multi-screen platformer. Add to that the fact that this had one of the best title screens in the late 80's and it is a fun addition to your collection, especially if you enjoy Zone Trooper. Published in Italy's Videoteca Computer n.3 as Jet Trooper and as Astroenergy in Nova Games n.19 (Aprile 1988).", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "George Wright", "publishers": "Editions Fermont", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.edicola8bit.com/riviste/nova_games/c64/preview/astroenergy.webm", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/122681-moonshadow-ocean-software\n"}
