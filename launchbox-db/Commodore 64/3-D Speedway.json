{"altername_name": ["Computer Speedway"], "name": "3-D Speedway", "overview": "Published in COMPUTE!'s Gazette 1988/04 (Issue #58). The year is 1992. Since the days of the Stanley Steamer, engineers have been trying to create the ultimate automobile. Early this year, such a car was finally created, with durability, efficiency, control and SPEED. Cynics have doubts about the automobile's true performance, though, so the car must be entered in a race to demonstrate its technological superiority. A careful survey of the population has shown that you are the only person on the planet who can push this car to its limits, so you will drive in the big race. The race is held in a large, flat valley with a circular track marked by poles. At the top of the screen, you'll see displays for the time remaining for each lap and the number of laps completed. When the game begins, there are 46 seconds on the clock. With each lap, the timer is reset with three seconds less than the previous lap. The game's goal is to complete each lap in the time given and to travel as far as possible before time runs out.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Chris Ulmer", "publishers": "COMPUTE!
