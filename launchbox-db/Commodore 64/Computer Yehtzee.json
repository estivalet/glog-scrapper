{"altername_name": [], "name": "Computer Yehtzee", "overview": "Yehtzee is the perfect example of a family or party game where up to six people can play at once, which is a welcome change from so many board game recreations for the computer. The basic idea of the game is to fill your card by rolling dice and getting the required sequences of dice. But if you have a roll and it does not meet the requirements of any of the required sequences then you must strike off one of the sequence choices. Every sequence has a point value and the object of the game is to maximize your total score. The sequences are loosely based on card sequences from the Poker card game. When your card is complete the computer will total up the score and display it on the master scoreboard.
