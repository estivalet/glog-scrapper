{"altername_name": [], "name": "Power Play", "overview": "A casino style betting game from Tim Hartnell & Brett Hale and published in 1984 from the book \"The Big Fat Book of Commodore 64 Games\". Your brilliant mathematical mind, and that of your computer, are locked in a deathless struggle to achieve numerical domination. At the start of the game, you're both issued with Large numbers, chosen at random. You are told what your number but you do not know what number the computer has been blessed with. The aim of the game is to exceed the other player's number by 1000000. Once you each have a number, you take away numbers from your opponent, simply by asking for them. For example, if the computer's number was 104637, and you said \"Give me your 6's\", 600 would be added to your number, and 600 subtracted from the computer's tally. If you asked for its 1's, 100000 would be added to your number (and - in this case - you'd probably win). At the end of the game, the changes in fortune which took place as it was running are shown.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Brett Hale", "publishers": "Interface Publications", "genres": "Casino", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.78", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/11627-power-play\n"}
