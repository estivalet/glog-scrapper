{"altername_name": [], "name": "SuperTed (Micromega)", "overview": "Texas Pete and his dastardly cronies Bulk and Skeleton are at large in Creepy Castle, and their plan is to blow it sky-high. Your mission in the game is to catch them all and put them behind bars before the bomb goes off. Move SuperTed about the maze of corridors of the castle to catch each of the villains individually and guide them to jail before the time runs out. Take too long to catch them all and any crook already caught may break free and need to be recaptured. Also, various items sticking out the edges of the maze will cause you to lose your superpowers which you'll need to re-energize by collecting one of the various bowls of red blancmange (!?) scattered about.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Micromega", "publishers": "Longman Group", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109997-superted-micromega\n"}
