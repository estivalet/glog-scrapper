{"altername_name": [], "name": "Shisen Sho", "overview": "You have to clear up the board by finding pairs of Mahjong tiles that can be connected by a line, with no more than 2 bends and which does not pass through any other tiles on the board. The game has 3 difficulty levels, 2 different game modes (one playing against the clock, and one relaxing mode, just letting you solve the boards with unlimited time and help). It has unlimited levels (well, counter wraps at 9999\u2026) and a high score saver. You can control the game with joystick or keyboard.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "April 8, 2023", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Scrap", "publishers": "Genesis Project", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FK6QpvcQGAA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/367747-shisen-sho\n"}
