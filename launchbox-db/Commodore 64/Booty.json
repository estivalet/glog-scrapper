{"altername_name": [], "name": "Booty", "overview": "Jim the Cabin Boy must make his way below decks to collect various items of booty (automatically picked up when he walks past it) strewn around the ship. When you have collected all the items from the Black Galleon's 20 holds, you will be given 45 seconds to locate the Bronze key to the next pile of booty. Clearing all booty a second and third (impossible!) time causes a search for the Silver and Gold keys, each increasing the game's speed and hazards. Jim will meet an untimely death if he falls through a trap door, drowns, is bitten by a ship's rat, or pecked by one of the Captain's parrots, or cut down by a Ghost Pirate, or blown up (some pieces of booty are booby-trapped to step lively, mates) or steps through a hold door into mid-air (heh! heh!).", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Kevin A.
