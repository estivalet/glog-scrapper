The caveat is that you are expected to cover your own insurance for each of the dangerous stunts. Completing each stunt scene will give you a certain amount of money that allows you to pay for the insurance for each stunt. The stunts vary from driving a car along a track, using ramps to jump over obstacles while shooting or avoiding others to flying a helicopter to rescue prisoners of war and rescue hostages from a burning building.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Enigma Variations", "publishers": "Alternative Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHP2lRoBl7s", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/111958-the-real-stunt-experts\n"}
