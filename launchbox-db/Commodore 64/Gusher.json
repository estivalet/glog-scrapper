{"altername_name": ["Black Gold"], "name": "Gusher", "overview": "you have seen the move, watch the TV series and read the book. Now play the game. Test your skill on the computer to become the richest oilman in the business. Challenge your friends to economic combat as you struggle with a string of outside elements that are not always favorable to you. How do you cope with disasters at the well head, thwart production problems on pipeline building, ship crude to your tanker fleet without hitches? It's bad enough fighting nature's provocations without having to contend with all the other oil tycoons. Still, if you are the first to make your million not even the computer will be able to argue that you are the undoubted winner. Visions will also give you a personal recommendation to the Chancellor of the Exchequer within any country of your choice.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Visions Software Factory", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/103079-gusher\n"}
