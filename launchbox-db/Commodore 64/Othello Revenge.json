{"altername_name": [], "name": "Othello Revenge", "overview": "This is a fun little strategy game programmed by Matteo Angelini, using CC65 and C language. Othello Revenge is based on the all time classic board game, Reversi/Othello. This game features scrolling background graphics and presentation based using the charset from the Hanoi Tower, which Matteo launched a few months back. The idea of this game is to place as many pieces on to the board adjacent to your opponent, trying to capture as many of your opponent's pieces and transforming them to your own colour. This game consists of 4 different skill levels. One of which you can play against a friend or family member and another where you play against the computer. The harder the level the longer thinking time the computer has. At the end of the game, the winner will be decided when the game board is full or there are no possible moves.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "June 29, 2020", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Matteo Angelini", "publishers": "The New Dimension (TND)", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYebDEwOaBo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/140902-othello-revenge\n"}
