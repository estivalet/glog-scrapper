{"altername_name": [], "name": "Superchase Remix", "overview": "A maze game for the Commodore 64 where you try to collect as much treasure as possible, while the Monster of Dungeons tries to stop you! It's also hungry! You leave a trail while moving, which the Monster follows, but there are ways to make it go astray... Superchase Remix is called like that because I remixed three different versions of the same game that got published in Compute! magazines and books in the early '80s (the original Vic-20 version was published on October 1982, so exactly 40 years ago).", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "November 1, 2022", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "JJFlash", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/169132-superchase-remix\n"}
