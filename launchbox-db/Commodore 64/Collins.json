{"altername_name": [], "name": "Collins", "overview": "Collins is a solitaire variant. It was developed by Maurice Jones and published in Loadstar #105 in 1993. COLLINS is played for score. Points are made by correctly identifying each card of the deck as a red spot card, a red face card, a black spot card, or a black face card. Use the CRSR keys to set the pointer to your choice and RETURN to select. If the choice is correct, the card will be turned and played face up by Suit. If the choice is wrong, a BUZZ is heard, and you must try again. When the game begins, 166 tries are available. If all cards are identified in the available tries, a bonus and an additional life are awarded, the deck is Shuffled, and additional tries are added to the number left. At each level, the bonus and the award per card and increased, but the number of the additional tries is decreased. If the deck is not exhausted in the allotted tries, a life is lost, and you must attempt the level again if you have any lives left. The game ends when all lives are lost.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Maurice Jones", "publishers": "Softdisk Publishing", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/158866-collins\n"}
