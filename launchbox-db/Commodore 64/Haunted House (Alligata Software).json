{"altername_name": ["Geisterhaus"], "name": "Haunted House (Alligata Software)", "overview": "In Haunted House, players control a ghost who has the task of preventing 20 souls from escaping the haunted house. They arrive in a room with eight doors, with the soul coming out from one of them. They must try to capture the souls before they reach the key that sits in the middle of the room and walking into the vortex nearby. If the souls fall into the vortex before the player captures them, then the player must go in after the souls. The vortex leads to the maze, and the object here is to try and capture the souls before they enter another vortex, while avoiding snakes and crashing into walls. Once players have captured 20 souls, the game's difficulty increases with bats appearing in the main room and speed increases.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Alligata Software", "publishers": "Alligata Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDcGKibe6sI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/104349-haunted-house-alligata-software\n"}
