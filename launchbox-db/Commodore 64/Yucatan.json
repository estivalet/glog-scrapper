{"altername_name": [], "name": "Yucatan", "overview": "You are an intrepid explorer, who is searching in the heart of the Yucatan forest, for artifacts to send back to the National Museum of Historical events. Unfortunately, the natives and the jungle critters don't like you very much. The natives want you out, and the critters, they just want you for lunch.Your task is to explore the jungle and villages, and pick up the idol artifacts. You will have a fixed quota to pick those idols up. Some will be in awkward places, which will unfortunately be impossible to get. Luckily, help is at hand.Strewn across the jungle are bombs. You can pick those up,and blow up anything in sight. Hint: only bomb awkward places, where you cannot get your hands on those idols. Do not waste those bombs. Also try to avoid placing bombs next to idols. Once they explode, the idols could be destroyed.As soon as you have picked up enough artifacts, you must make your way to the end of the level, to move on to the next level. You will be rewarded bonus points for a level completed, then move on to the next stage. Where you have to match the quota once again. Can you complete all stages of Yucatan, or will the natives and critters prevent you from achieving your goal?", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2009", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Achim Volkers", "publishers": "Commodore Free", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4KaCzDWtFk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/76176-yucatan\n"}
