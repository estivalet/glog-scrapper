{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Market Place", "overview": "MECC helps us learn how to sell things and adjust for cost of production, advertising, etc. Or perhaps, how not to do these things. It is a competitive strategy game for up to 6 players. The Market Place is an educational business simulator for multiple systems. Designed to teach children about basic business practices including advertisement, profit, loss, and setting prices. Children learn by selling apples, tomato plants, and lemonade. In Sell Apples, the player sets the prices at an apple orchard, and sees how the cost per apple effects sales for the day. Players can experiment with higher and lower prices to see which optimizes profit. The player must then calculate their total profit. In Sell Tomatoes, the player looks at advertising budgets. The player starts with 1000 tomato plants, which must sell for 50 cents each. The player can set their advertising budget, to see how it changes sales. They must then calculate their expenses, income, and profits. In Sell Lemonade, the player combines both setting prices and advertising. The player runs a lemonade stand, and controls how much lemonade to try to sell for the day, the cost to charge, and how much advertisement to purchase. Sales are effected daily by the weather.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Chad C.
