{"altername_name": ["Super Mario Bros 3", "Discesa Infernale"], "name": "Super Mario Bros III", "overview": "Goldenbear took Ikari's crack of Game Over II +, turned the trainer on, edited the sprites and title screen, entered the password then froze it. I've seen this claimed to be a real commercial production that was supplied and cracked in at least four cases even though the evidence of it being a horrible hack is glaringly obvious. Like Abyss' Super Mario Bros +3 this is a modification of an existing game to fit a Super Mario Bros theme. Except where Abyss' production is delightful, the only way this resembles a Mario game is that the player jumps in a similar, but very slow, way. The goombah sprites are off and other sprites have incomplete animations and switch back and forth between their original forms and the edited ones.
