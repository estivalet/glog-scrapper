{"altername_name": ["Fold'em II"], "name": "Fold'em 2", "overview": "Fold'em 2 is the successful successor to Fold'em. Just like the first part, Fold'em 2 is a traditional 2D top-down puzzle game with more colors and improved graphics than his predecessor. Each of the 100 levels presents numerous tiles, which must be removed one-by-one to progress. The catch is that once a tile is gone, there is no going back on it, so you must carefully plan the fastest and safest route. The game starts simple and slowly introduces more puzzle elements as you go. In the further course you will also come across other tiles - such as teleporters or those that can be entered twice or only in one direction.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "December 11, 2020", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "INC-X Software", "publishers": "", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mWxmNKwBPs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/160266-foldem-2\n"}
