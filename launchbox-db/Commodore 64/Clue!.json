{"altername_name": [], "name": "Clue!", "overview": "Clue! is another conversion of the classic board game Clue/Cluedo. Like in the original, three cards are randomly selected showing the murderer, the weapon and the room where the crime happened. The objective is to deduct these cards by moving between rooms, making accusations and analyzing the information gathered. The game was developed by Joe Obrin originally as a gift for his wife. However it eventually made its way into the public domain.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Joe Obrin", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "6", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/153755-clue\n"}
