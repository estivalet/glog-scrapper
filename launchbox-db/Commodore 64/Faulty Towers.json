{"altername_name": [], "name": "Faulty Towers", "overview": "This adventure follows the fortunes of hotel owner Basis Faulty. Your task is to help him keep his hotel open (and his sanity!) for a week. One week being defined as 1000 moves. Trying to close you down are various characters who arrive and demand service at odd intervals. You are however expecting the arrival of the Public Health Inspector and it is essential that you ensure that you have already disposed of anything to which they might find an objection. You can score points by disposing of these objects and you can get a bonus by hitting Manuel, the idot Spanish waiter, also by insulting your dear wife Sybil, but for goodness sake don't let her hear you.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Diana Jones", "publishers": "Harboursoft", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75919-faulty-towers\n"}
