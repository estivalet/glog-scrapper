{"altername_name": ["The Island of Dr. Destructo"], "name": "Destructo", "overview": "You are leading a mission to destroy Dr. Destructo's array of ships, and ultimately his island hideout, over 21 levels. You do this by flying a plane over a limited area, and shooting his planes so that they fall and inflict damage on the target item, which is large at the bottom of the screen. Multiple shots on a particular spot will ultimately cause a water-spout; three waterspouts and the ship (or island) will sink. Some enemy beings can be shot down, but others are indestructible and require evasive action. You are also armed with a bomb, which can be used to inflict precise damage once per level. One of the features of this game is that it uses a day/night cycle.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Richard Aplin", "publishers": "Bulldog Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzwqM0HjPNw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106628-destructo\n"}
