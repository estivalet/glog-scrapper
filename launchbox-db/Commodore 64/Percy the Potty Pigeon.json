{"altername_name": ["Potty Pigeon"], "name": "Percy the Potty Pigeon", "overview": "Make a suicide journey with our fluffy little friend Percy in his desperate attempts to build himself a cosy little home. Plunging to near certain destruction this crazy little bird has to pluck ten nest building twigs from the path of onrushing traffic, frantically avoiding the unwelcome attentions of a pigeon eating cat and starving ferret. Once off the tarmac, the danger doesn\u2019t end as Percy carefully avoids the kamikaze planes, balloons and twig snatching sparrows before he can complete his nest and move to the next level. But don\u2019t be totally disheartened, our loveable little character has a few surprises of his own in the shape of revolting explosive eggs.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "July 12, 1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Antony Crowther", "publishers": "Celery Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.72", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potty_Pigeon", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQU-6MeCAAU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/32124-percy-the-potty-pigeon\n"}
