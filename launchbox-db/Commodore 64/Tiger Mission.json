{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tiger Mission", "overview": "Tiger Mission is a vertically scrolling shooter in which the player controls a helicopter. The goal is easy to explain: destroying the enemy base at the end of five levels and avoiding the own destruction. Attackers only appear on the ground and using the standard cannon normally takes care of them. Additionally there is a limited amount of smart bombs available which can be unleashed at any time to wipe out everything on the screen. Extras can be collected after shooting boxes on the ground: smart bombs go into the inventory while everything else, e.g. turbo speed or better range, are limited in time and used immediately after picking them up. After losing one of the three lives, the current level has to restarted from the beginning.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kele Line", "publishers": "Alternative Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsPAAu-cvc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113779-tiger-mission\n"}
