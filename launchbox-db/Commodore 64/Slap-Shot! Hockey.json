{"altername_name": ["Slap-Shot!", "Slapshot!"], "name": "Slap-Shot! Hockey", "overview": "This is a 2 player only hockey game. You can select from six teams. They are: Team Canada Team U.S.A. The Soviet Union Czechoslovakia Team Sweden West Germany The game has three matches that last three minutes each. You can pass the puck between players in any direction and, if an opposing player is in the path, it can be intercepted. The game also allows for body checking but if you get too rough, you can be penalized. The action can get fast so you need quick reflexes if you want to win. A sequel called International Hockey was released in 1985 which had some major updates, the main one being that unlike this game, the sequel has a single player mode.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Superior Quality Software", "publishers": "Advantage Artworx", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3xEhBMjHLM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/62586-slap-shot-hockey\n"}
