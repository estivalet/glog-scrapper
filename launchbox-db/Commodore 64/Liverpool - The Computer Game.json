{"altername_name": [], "name": "Liverpool: The Computer Game", "overview": "Arc Developments converted their football game to the Commodore 64 using a top-down view very similar to Kick Off. Options are otherwise virtually identical, with cup and full season options over a variable match length, although player profiles feature basic statistics instead of textual information, and you can play shorter matches than in the 16-bit version. Game play is also very similar, with one-touch passing and fairly close ball control, although the control of free kicks is less precise in this version.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Arc Developments", "publishers": "Grandslam Entertainment", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEJ7rD2N5zw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/110450-liverpool-the-computer-game\n"}
