{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bill & Ted's Excellent Game Boy Adventure", "overview": "No way! Yes way. This, my friends, is the conversion of the legendary Bill & Ted Game Boy\u2122 game by LJN/Beam Software to the Commodore 64. I used to have this cartdrige in the 90's with my Game Boy and really enjoyed the fast pace and simple but addictive game mechanics. Also the music is great. And you can play as Keanu Reeves - what could be more awesome. So I remade the game from scratch for the C64. SID music was done by Nordischsound. Enjoy!
