{"altername_name": [], "name": "Apache Strike", "overview": "The year is 1997. You're piloting an AH-64 Apache helicopter through enemy city streets on a search and destroy mission. Your target: the Strategic Defense Computer (SDC). You must weave your way in and out of skyscraper corridors. That's the easy part; but enemy helicopters and tanks dog your path -- you must destroy or be destroyed. If you root out the SDC in all three cities, you can save the world from complete nuclear destruction.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Activision", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.3", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Strike", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/87243-apache-strike\n"}
