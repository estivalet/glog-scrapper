{"altername_name": [], "name": "Crillion", "overview": "Crillion is similar to Breakout except there is no paddle and the player controls the ball directly. The ball always bounces up and down and the player only controls its horizontal movement. When the ball hits a block of the same color it will dissolve. The ball can change color when hitting a color changer blocks, marked with an asterisk. The object of the game is to clear all blocks while avoiding the skull blocks. When the player hits a skull block, a life is lost and the level restarts, resetting any progress made so far in that level. There also are unbreakable walls and slider blocks. The slider blocks can only be moved around when the ball has the same color.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Oliver Kirwa", "publishers": "Markt & Technik", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pBsyOKlrrc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/94984-crillion\n"}
