{"altername_name": [], "name": "Faxen Freddi", "overview": "An arcade platformer in the style of Q-Bert created by Christoph Rothert and published in the magazine, Computer Kontakt 1985/03. Faxen Freddy is a Q-Bert version for the C 64. Here, too, there is a pyramid that the player must recolor with his Faxen Freddy. When all steps are colored, the next level comes up. Everything would be very easy if it weren't for the jack-in-the-box that Freddy has to avoid at all costs. The game isn't easy, because with each level an additional jack-in-the-box is added and you only have one Freddy at your disposal. It is controlled via keyboard or joystick (port 1).", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Christoph Rothert", "publishers": "R\u00e4tz-Eberle Verlag", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/100446-faxen-freddi\n"}
