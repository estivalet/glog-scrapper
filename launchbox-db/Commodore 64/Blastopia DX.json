{"altername_name": [], "name": "Blastopia DX", "overview": "Planet Earth had close encounters by alien ships. They pop down to the zoos, parks and many other places and captured all the camels. Scientists discovered that the much loved beasts are being carried to various obscure planets. Aliens have captured aliens, to make a powerful weapon which can destroy planet Earth. The Prime Minister has called a plucky brave hero to take on those nasty aliens with the aid of piloting Blastopia. Unfortunately it is of course you. Your mission is to enter each of the 8 alien planets. Do battle against full fleets. For every full fleet you battle, a camel will fall to its death. You must rescue the camel before it is no more. If you miss any camels, don't worry, you can still keep on blasting aliens, scoring points. Once your camel quota has exceeded, you music land safely on to the launchpad to destroy the alien planet. Watch out for the scrolling background, laser gates and aliens. They will sap your shield. Once your shield has run out BOOM, you're toast. Luckily the ship can rebuild itself - but only a limited number of times it can do that.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2019", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Richard Bayliss", "publishers": "The New Dimension (TND)", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2VCvBCWvKg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/118563-blastopia-dx\n"}
