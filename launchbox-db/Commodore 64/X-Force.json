{"altername_name": [], "name": "X-Force", "overview": "It has been discovered the planet Darx is rich in minerals that Earth needs to use to construct a shield to protect our planet from a possible alien invasion. You are sent on a mission to the planet Darx to extract the minerals we desperately need for our planetary defence shield. Darx was not an uninhabited planet however. Your ship is detected on approach and an alien mothership dispatches forces that capture your vessel. You must use your wits, cunning and reflexes to avoid the aliens and escape from the 16 underground sectors of the planet Darx. You must avoid laser gates on the way and grab any floating pods that can enhance your firepower.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "June 2, 2015", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "The New Dimension (TND)", "publishers": "Psytronik Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6Rl91fxFAk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/105893-x-force\n"}
