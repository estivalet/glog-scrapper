{"altername_name": ["Ms. Pacman"], "name": "Ms. Pac-Man", "overview": "The gameplay of Ms. Pac-Man is largely identical to that of the original Pac-Man. The player gathers points by eating dots and avoiding ghosts (contact with one loses a life). Power-pellets or energizers change the ghosts, which reverse their course and can be eaten for bonus points. Fruit bonuses can be consumed for increasing point values, twice per level. As the levels increase, the speed and difficulty increase as well.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "General Computer", "publishers": "Atarisoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.85", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ms._Pac-Man#Ports", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_I1FboBOoA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6245-ms-pac-man\n"}
