{"altername_name": ["Flip and Flop"], "name": "Flip & Flop", "overview": "Flip & Flop is a kind of Pac-Man in isometric graphics on platforms which are connected by ladders. The player controls alternately Flip, a kangaroo, who jumps around on the platforms and Mitch, an ape, who layaways along the platforms. A zoo-keeper tries to catch Flip, and Mitch is being chased by a net. There are sticky fields on which one may lure keeper and net, where they are caught for some seconds. If the player runs beyond the border, he falls off the playing field and loses a life, just as by being caught. Already revealed field remain revealed. The goal is to pass all marked fields. Every five levels there is a short sequence with a small circus presentation. When the character approaches the border, scrolling is carried out. In Level 13, the maximum playing field size is reached, later fields must be uncovered twice, and even later there aren't any more sticky fields in the level.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jim Nangano", "publishers": "First Star Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.1", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip_%26_Flop", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhn9HB0y-Sg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/31786-flip-flop\n"}
