{"altername_name": [], "name": "Othello (Microelectronica)", "overview": "Othello is based on the board game where each player attempts to have more counters on the board than their opponent on a 8 x 8 grid. The game starts with both players having two counters in the center of the board diagonal from each other. To take another piece, the player places a counter to have a number of their opponents counters between two of the players counters, vertical, horizontal or diagonal. The opponents color is then turned into the players color and it is then the other players turn. This carries on until the board is full or no counters can be placed.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ernesto Mart\u00ednez de Carvajal Hedrich", "publishers": "Microelectr\u00f3nica y Control", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/121418-othello-microelectronica\n"}
