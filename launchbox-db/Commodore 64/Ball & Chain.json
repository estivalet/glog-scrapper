{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ball & Chain", "overview": "Deep down in the dark and gloomy dungeons of the Spike Empire, an innocent bouncy ball has been held in captivity, chained to\u2026. a ball, a heavy iron ball that is! Ball and Chain is an endless runner where the difficulty ramps up until you inevitably \u201cdrop the ball.\u201d One day, after a generous helping of helium (no idea where he found it), our hero decides to flee the Spike Empire and return to the land of fun and games. You control the helium filled hero and while the iron ball limits your movement, it can also be used as a weapon! Your escape for freedom comes to an end when you either collide with an enemy, or are crushed by a wall. Pressing the fire button shortens the chain and gives tighter control over the iron ball, releasing the button pushes the iron ball to the opposite direction. The score increases the longer you stay alive. Collect coins and stars along the way to increase your score further. Stars improve the time base scoring factor, but come at a cost. They also increase the mass of the iron ball, thus increasing its weight and inertia until you are unable to spin it or even lift it from the ground.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "June 1, 2022", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "DrMortalWombat", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162763-ball-chain\n"}
