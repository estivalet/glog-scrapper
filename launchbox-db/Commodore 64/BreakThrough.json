{"altername_name": ["Break Through", "Break Through Preview"], "name": "BreakThrough", "overview": "One of the first SEUCK horizontal shooters, created by Jonathan Wells, who introduced the code for \"Sideways SEUCK\" shooters. Jon was a master of adding his own coded power-ups, and even added large baddies which exploded together and not in annoying chunks. It was initially released as a working preview in Commodore Format's, Powerpack #36 and was improved upon and released to the scene to continue improving. Jonathan says all his games will one day be completed and hopefully released in his own final format, until then this is a nice shooter and a fun hour or two of diversion.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jonathan Wells", "publishers": "Commodore Format", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/158515-breakthrough\n"}
