{"altername_name": [], "name": "Jet Ace", "overview": "Jet Ace is an unofficial modded/hacked version of the game Destruct. The only main difference (aside from the title screen) Is that the player sprite was changed from a guy on a jetpack to an R-Type like spaceship, and some of the enemies have been modified as well. This hack was done by Jesper Lund Hansen and released a year after the original game.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Clark Denham", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/168704-jet-ace\n"}
