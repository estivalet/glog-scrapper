{"altername_name": [], "name": "It's Magic (Markt & Technik)", "overview": "It's Magic (not to be confused with the public domain game from Protovision's public domain label) is a miscellaneous action/platform game. It was developed by Stefan Muth and published in 64'er 1991/11. Magic doesn't get you very far in this game by Stefan Muth, even if the title might suggest so. Rather, a reaction and a portion of desire are required here. The task is to bring back a lost amulet to a magician. The problem with this is that this magician lives in a penthouse on the 28th floor, and there are six elevators on each floor. One of these blinks, and now the amulet has to be moved to it with the help of the joystick. Now simply press the (fire) button. A new elevator will blink, so it's up and down the first level 20 times. Sounds pretty easy so far, almost too easy.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "November 1, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Stefan Muth", "publishers": "Markt & Technik", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/167113-its-magic-markt-technik\n"}
