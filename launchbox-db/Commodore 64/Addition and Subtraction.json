{"altername_name": [], "name": "Addition and Subtraction", "overview": "An educational game created by Vince Apps and published in 1984 in the book \"40 Educational Games for the Commodore 64\". When you cover other sums programs in this book you will find that we recommend that you don\u2019t use pencils, paper or calculators because you probably won\u2019t have them the next time you are sent out to shop for your parents. It helps to be able to do your own sums in your head because it might save you having to go back to the shops because you didn\u2019t have enough money the first time you went. We have made this game look just like it would on your school papers. You even fill in the totals by putting the numbers in from right to left just like you do in your math books. If you get a correct answer a little blue munchman will run across the screen and eat away the whole sum. If you are wrong however the munchman will only eat away the incorrect answer and you will have to try again. Give your munchman a full stomach by getting as many correct as you can because the score board will show how many tries and how many mistakes you made.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Vince Apps", "publishers": "Granada Publishing Ltd.", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/160584-addition-and-subtraction\n"}
