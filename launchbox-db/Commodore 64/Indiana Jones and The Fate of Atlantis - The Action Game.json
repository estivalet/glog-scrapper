{"altername_name": [], "name": "Indiana Jones and The Fate of Atlantis: The Action Game", "overview": "Being an action title, the game starts off where Indy is about to have an excuse to use his trusty whip: in Monte Carlo, after he recruited headstrong former student Sophie to his aid and determined the location of ancient discs needed to open the door to the lost city of Atlantis. Most action takes place in isometric view, although there are some variations along the way to keep up interest. There are even some adventure-game elements, such as Indy's inventory which you can fill with various objects to use (i.e. money to buy things). They are mostly easy though, and are there only to relieve the tension from knuckle-blistering action.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Attention to Detail", "publishers": "LucasArts", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Last_Crusade:_The_Action_Game", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/96624-indiana-jones-and-the-fate-of-atlantis-the-action-game\n"}
