{"altername_name": ["Calcio Spaziale"], "name": "Tank Division", "overview": "A 2P Only (Simultaneous) sports style game. Here is a truly futuristic version of the football game. Invite a friend to challenge you in a space game whose end will be determined only by the expiration of time or by the exhaustion of the shots available to each player. Put yourself in the shoes of a goalkeeper driving a tank and get ready to defend your goal. Each player must try to hit the ball with the shots fired from the cannon, obviously directing it towards the opponent's goal. The task is not at all easy because the ball has to be hit with a graze to be able to move it from the center of the field. In fact, if you players hit it centrally, but from opposite sides, the ball would remain motionless until the blows of one of the players were exhausted. Have good fun figuring it out!
