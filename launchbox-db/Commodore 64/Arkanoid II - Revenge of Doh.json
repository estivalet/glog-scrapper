Eons ago, you battered DOH into an intergalactic pulp and escaped. But a scrap of DOH's core energy survived... And now DOH's hurtling toward you across space and time in the Xorg, a huge spaceship that's crashed into our universe from an unknown dimension. Use your ultra-fast reflexes and intense concentration to get to the core of the Xorg without pounding your ship to interstellar scrap. Or take a break from battle. Create your own force barriers with the Arkanoid Construction Set, the latest in intergalactic dimension-building tools. If you're good enough, you'll get through. And come fact to face with the force of DOH.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "November 11, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ocean Software", "publishers": "Imagine Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.39", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkanoid:_Revenge_of_Doh", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr2kkBV4hTk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6397-arkanoid-ii-revenge-of-doh\n"}
