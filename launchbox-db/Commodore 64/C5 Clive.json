{"altername_name": [], "name": "C5 Clive", "overview": "The C5 electric car wasn't a huge success for Sir Clive Sinclair, and it largely undid the reputation he'd built up form inventions such as the Spectrum. This budget-price game wasn't the only one to gently mock it. You star as Clive aboard the car, and must travel through a succession of screens, which alternate between two different styles. The odd-numbered levels involve dodging hazards including trees, ghosts and brick walls to collect batteries - contact with any of these costs you a life. The objects are drawn as if 3D, but contact with any part of them is costly. The even-numbered levels play like a simplified Moon Patrol, as Clive must jump over cars and pedestrians.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "David Broadhurst", "publishers": "Scorpio Gamesworld", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90244-c5-clive\n"}
