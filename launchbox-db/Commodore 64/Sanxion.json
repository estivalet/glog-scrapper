{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sanxion", "overview": "Sanxion is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up, the goal to traverse each level from left to right avoiding or destroying any enemies and obstacles. The side-scroller speed is controllable, increasing the closer the player is to the center of the screen. The screen is divided in two sections, the upper one with a cenital view, and the lower one, taking up two-thirds of the screen, shows a typical side view. Enemies can come from both sides of the screen in close formations that the player must avoid colliding with.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "July 15, 1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Thalamus", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.81", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanxion", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNx1nN8eHhU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6895-sanxion\n"}
