{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hot Wheels (Epyx)", "overview": "In Hot Wheels, the player could build his own car from scratch, choosing from three parts that would made up your car, a front, a mid section and a rear end. Last but not least, you could paint the car in all sorts of colours, although this could be changed later in the game. Afterward, the player could drive around the town and engage in various mini-games which were accessible throughout the town, which would involve the own car, such as racing around tracks or a destruction derby.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kevin Kenney", "publishers": "Epyx", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.07", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Wheels_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL98btGEiRQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/71427-hot-wheels-epyx\n"}
