{"altername_name": ["She-Fox"], "name": "Vixen", "overview": "The Vixen is the last human on the planet Granath, which is now ruled by a race of dinosaurs. She has been raised by foxes, and intends to follow through on a promise she made to her elders to wipe them out and restore the planet to humanity. Each level must be completed within a time limit, but progressing from left to right. She is armed with a whip, a useful weapon for attacking the denizens of dinosaurs on each level. Lots of bonus items can also be whipped to activate them - bonus lives and extra time for example. Tokens to turn into a fox can also be collected - enough of these takes you into a bonus level set underground.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Intelligent Design", "publishers": "Alternative Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vixen_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErrM5R8Geow", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113784-vixen\n"}
