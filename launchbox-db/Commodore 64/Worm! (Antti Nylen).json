{"altername_name": ["Serpentone"], "name": "Worm! (Antti Nylen)", "overview": "Worm! is rather original take on the snake variant in which you must eat all the mushrooms and then find the exit to get to the next level while avoiding or shooting the Grim Reapers roaming around the maze. In order to shoot you must first collect bullets that can be found around the maze. As in all Snake variants, every time you eat a mushroom your body gets longer, making it increasingly difficult to avoid Mr Reaper.
