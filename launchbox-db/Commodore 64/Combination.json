{"altername_name": [], "name": "Combination", "overview": "A puzzle game created by The Creators (represented by Helfried Peyrl who did the coding, Roland Ottensamer on graphics, and Antti Hannula for the music) and published in Magic Disk 64 1995/01. The aim of the game is to clear all colorful, moving pieces from the playing field. To do this, you simply have to make the stones disappear by pushing the same stones horizontally or vertically (sideways) together. With the joystick in Port II you control the blinking cursor, which you can point to the desired stones in order to move them. By pressing the joystick button and simultaneously moving the joystick to the left or right, the stone under the cursor can be moved to the left or right. It is not possible to move the stones vertically. In addition, gravity acts on the pieces, and pieces with a free space below them fall down until they hit another piece. It is of course also possible to move a piece if there are other pieces above it. The pieces only disappear when the pieces in question are in a rest position. If there are only 3 pieces left of a type of stone, the stones must be arranged and shifted so skilfully that they touch each other at the same time and thus all three disappear. The player has 3 attempts and a limited time limit.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "January 2, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "The Creators", "publishers": "CP Verlag", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhhSwUK6cAI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/91119-combination\n"}
