{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pure-Stat Football", "overview": "This is a football game focused on simulation and statistics. It doesn't appear to have an NFL license or an NFL players' license, but it has the rosters and statistics for NFL teams and players as of the 1986 season. You can select two teams and let the computer play out a game, or you can be a coach and select plays. In either case, the success or failure is dependent on the relevant statistics.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Software Simulations", "publishers": "Software Simulations", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/121913-pure-stat-football\n"}
