{"altername_name": ["Reactor 2"], "name": "Reactor II", "overview": "A horizontally-scrolling space shooter with lots of skulls published in Magic Disk 64 1994/12. Due to the numerous positive and encouraging letters from readers that we received about the space shooting Reactor, we have decided to publish a second part. After having to endure many difficult tasks on the way to the end of the galaxy in the first part in the search for knowledge and wisdom, it is now time to use the acquired knowledge to improve the living conditions on your own home planet. But the current rulers have absolutely no interest in anything changing for them. So the dark masterminds sent their armies of darkness to keep the hero from doing his thing. Unfortunately, only a small and poorly equipped space glider is available to master the long way and the upcoming battles. However, there is the possibility of some special opponents picking up parts of the equipment that, after being destroyed, float through space protected by a spherical subspace field. The different colors mean: \u2022 Violet: additional tabs \u2022 Brown: energy \u2022 Green: protective screen \u2022 Grey: Smartbomb \u2022 Blue: weapons If you have equipped the space glider with all the additional systems and pick up another bonus item, you will receive a Smartbomb that can be detonated with Space. The game is controlled via the joystick in port # 2 and you start with three lives.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "S\u00f6ren Kress", "publishers": "CP Verlag", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SW6clDoo7E", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/125600-reactor-ii\n"}
