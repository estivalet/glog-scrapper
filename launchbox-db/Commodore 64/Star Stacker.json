{"altername_name": [], "name": "Star Stacker", "overview": "Star Stacker is a 1-4 player puzzle game (5 if you want to add a computer controlled player) for the Commodore 64. It was developed by C.E. \"Spock\" Prince and published in Loadstar #127. Our master copyist's latest brain game pits you against a ruthless computer in a game of colors and shapes. Star Stacker was inspired by a British game called Continuo, and is in some ways similar to Dave Johannsen's Quadrilaton. The computer will play at 3 levels of difficulty: Novice, Expert and Mojo. The program will randomly choose a 4x4 tile of 16 randomly colored squares on the board. The first play is dealt random tile to play. He moves the tile around the play area with the CRSR keys or joystick and drop it anywhere, even on top of a currently placed tile. The player gets a point for every square of his tile that is ON TOP of a currently existing square of the same color. He also gets one point for each square that orthogonally borders a square of the same color that was just placed. Diagonals don't count. You have a choice of 5 different background patterns. F1 for instructions. F2 to change level. F3 to change the Pattern. F4 to toggle players. F5 for high score list. F6 for color selector. Additionally you can rotate your tile before playing.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "C.E.
