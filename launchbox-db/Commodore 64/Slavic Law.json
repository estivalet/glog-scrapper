{"altername_name": [], "name": "Slavic Law", "overview": "Slavic Law is yet another solitaire game developed by the most prolific developer of C64 solitaire games, Maurice Jones. This one was developed in the year 2000, and release in Loadstar #198. The Game: One king is removed from a double deck of cards and placed to the left. Turn cards from the deck to the queen, spreading them downward. When another king is turned, the computer will place it to the right of the first pile and the process is continued until all the cards have been turned. The top card of each pile is available for play at all times. As they become available, the aces are played in a row above the kings to form the foundation. The aces are built upward without regard to suit to the jack. The queens are dead cards and are moved, as they are turned, to a pile to the left of the layout. The player may arrange the foundations in any way he/she chooses. The object is to build all cards except the kings and queens to the foundations. If all covering cards are removed from a king, any available card may be played there, but only after all cards have been turned from the deck. The game can be played with either a joystick, keyboard, and even a properly configured mouse.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Maurice Jones", "publishers": "J & F Publishing, Inc.", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/155721-slavic-law\n"}
