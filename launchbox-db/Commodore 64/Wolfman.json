{"altername_name": [], "name": "Wolfman", "overview": "You wake up one morning, covered in blood but seemingly uninjured. Could the rumours about a werewolf's curse having returned be true, and could you be the one struck with this curse? Yes, they could. Wolfman is a text adventure split into three parts, played through the eyes of a different character each time. In the first you are the werewolf's host, and must beat the curse back. Sex is added to ultra-violence in part 2; you play the woman who loves him, and must survive a night of passion. In part 3 you play the host again, and must reach Fi Shan monastery to find the cure.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Rod Pike", "publishers": "CRL (Computer Rentals Limited)", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAQqlmMH1o0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/89297-wolfman\n"}
