{"altername_name": [], "name": "Snare (Thalamus)", "overview": "The rich Andr\u00e9 Thelman used the last years of his life to build a deadly maze with 20 levels. Whoever passes it will find a valuable item at the end - and of course the protagonist wants to grab it. The player takes control of a boat with the one and only goal to find the correct teleporter to the next level. The boat has the ability to jump over holes and use a gun to shoot at robots which try to harm it. These robots come in multiple variants with different behaviour. Progress is made more difficult by switch puzzles and special tiles, like ones which prevent the ship from turning around. Power ups like a level skip or extra lives can be picked up inside the levels, but they disappear after a short time. However, the picked up symbols don't get activated before finishing the current level. When the ship turns around, the whole level flips around it.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "July 15, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Rob Stevens", "publishers": "Thalamus", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiU77pZaUBs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/7220-snare-thalamus\n"}
