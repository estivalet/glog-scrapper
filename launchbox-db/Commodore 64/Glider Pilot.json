{"altername_name": [], "name": "Glider Pilot", "overview": "Glider Pilot is a flight simulation allowing you to try to fly a glider around a 160km course before landing. Before you fly you can pick five levels of weather (1 is the easiest) or adjust various weather parameters yourself. To start flying the course and to start the timer, you have to cross the runway below then you have to attempt to turn at two points on the airfield before attempting to land on the runway. As a glider has no engine you have to use thermals, which is rising warm air to keep in the air. Thermals are invisible so the position of Cumulus clouds in the distance give an indication of where the thermals are. The game is viewed as a 1st person perspective. As well as the main playing area you also have various instruments to help you in your flight. Air Speed, Compass, Variometer (rate of climb or descent), Nose Angle, Altitude, Time and a map of the course. The joystick or keyboard is used to control your glider.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Richard Brisbourne", "publishers": "CRL (Computer Rentals Limited)", "genres": "Flight Simulator", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/102483-glider-pilot\n"}
