You also have the option to test your skills in a one player game against the clock. The object of the game is to guide your rider as quickly and carefully as possible through three out of the possible courses you get to choose from before each race. The original C64 version only had 8, while the C16 version had 16 courses that have to be done in order with five lives, with this version you get all 16 to choose from! Every course has its own level of difficulty and a unique layout of trees, car's, bus's and pools of water for you to avoid by jumping your bike over. You can use your joystick or keyboard to accelerate, decelerate, wheelie and jump your bike from start to finish.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "May 11, 2003", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Shaun Southern", "publishers": "", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/118088-kikstart-128\n"}
