{"altername_name": [], "name": "ATC: Air Traffic Controller", "overview": "A game by Terry L. Flynn and published in Loadstar #155. The object is to land 8 planes that have entered your airspace. On the RADAR screen, you will see an airport, the center colored circles. Each plane will have its own three digit ID number. To get a status report on a plane, type in that number, or type all to get the status of all the planes at once. When you check the status of a plane, you will have the option of changing the altitude and heading of that craft to avoid colliding with any other planes. The flight speed of each plane varies, and is not adjustable, but the the altitude can be altered at random by wind shear and updrafts, so you should watch it closely. If 2 planes occupy the same airspace and have less than 150 feet between their altitudes, they will crash and the simulation, and your JOB will end! If 2 planes are are in the same airspace an alarm will sound alerting you to their proximity. Carefully guide each plane to the flashing white dot just above the airport, when they reach that point the simulation will land them for you. If you re-direct a plane away from the airport and it flies off the screen, it will run out of fuel and crash, and the simulation will end. Land all 8 planes and you win the simulation and can try on one of the 7 levels of play difficulty.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Terry L.
