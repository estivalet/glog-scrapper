The poor sheep find themselves stuck in an awkward position. Enter one woolly hero, Shauny and his good buddy, Rover the watchdog. Help Shauny make his way through the farmyard, saving his sheep buddies - and feed sausages to the foxes before he becomes din dins for them. This game is split into two parts. The first part, is where you are the sheep. The second part is where the watchdog has to protect the sheep at night.
