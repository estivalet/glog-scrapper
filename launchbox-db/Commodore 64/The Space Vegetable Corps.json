It is the year 2040 A.D. and humanity is turning the planets and moons into a series of huge hydroponic greenhouses. Because the protagonist is out of money, his only goal is to pay his way home by taking the worst job in the galaxy, enlisting himself into the ranks of the Space Vegetable Corps. Players move the protagonist wearing a spacesuit on the moon surface, protecting the vegetables growing in domes, shooting the alien forms, and collecting certain vegetables to reach a quota set for a day on a moon. There are three moons (Phobos, Diemos and Riscos) to complete. The characters wears a jetpack that allows him to fly. Flying aliens sometimes want to steal a dome. These aliens have to be eliminated, but sometimes the dome breaks if the creature is killed too high above the surface. Certain creatures release oxygen after dying, and it can be collected to refill the spacesuit's reserve. Vegetables grow inside the dome in a cyclical manner and they need to be collected when they have a sufficient height. When the quota is reached, another day with a new quota begins until the character is transferred to the next moon. When all domes with vegetables are destroyed or when the oxygen is exhausted, the game is over. Top 10 galactic gardeners are stored in hi-scores table.
