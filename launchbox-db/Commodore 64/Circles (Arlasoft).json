{"altername_name": [], "name": "Circles (Arlasoft)", "overview": "Join a sequence of at least two adjacent circles of the same colour to clear them and score points, the more are cleared in one move the more you score. Cleared circles will be replaced by new colours dropping from the top. You can move around corners to create L, S or U shapes, however you can't move back on yourself to draw a T-shape for example. You have 90 seconds to build as high a score as possible. As with my other entry it will only be playable in the browser until the competition deadline passes. Programmed in BASIC on TheC64.
