{"altername_name": [], "name": "Metron", "overview": "The player must navigate their space ship and destroy everything in space, including mines, cruisers, and star bases. (The cruisers are only visible when you approach their base. They then approach your ship and start circling it, urging you to wipe them out.) Two types of rocks can be found. Red rocks contain minerals which increase your score when they are collected. The player needs to destroy these rocks quickly before it is replaced by a processor. Green rocks leave behind smart bombs that can be used to destroy the star bases, but only three smart bombs can be used at a time. The game ends when the player runs out of energy or goes off the edge of the playfield.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kyle Hodgetts", "publishers": "ECP (Entertainment and Computer Products Pty.
