{"altername_name": [], "name": "Luna Landa", "overview": "A Lunar Lander game from the book \"Commodore 64 Games Book\", created by Clifford Ramshaw & Mark Ramshaw and published by Melbourne House in 1983. This is one for all you budding young astronauts. The surface of the moon is looming closer, and you must control the horizontal and vertical velocities of your module to achieve a feather-light landing. Keep an eye on your fuel gauge at the bottom of the screen, don\u2019t run out of fuel. The more difficult the landing site the more points you get for a successful mission, each perfect landing increases the difficulty of the next. Be careful not to damage your module by landing too hard.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Clifford Ramshaw", "publishers": "Melbourne House", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165982-luna-landa\n"}
