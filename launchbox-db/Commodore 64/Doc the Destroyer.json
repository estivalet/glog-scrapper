Against all advice, Doc the Destroyer attempts to put things right by convincing people to return overground. Gameplay has several distinct elements, beginning with creating a character by balancing strength, endurance, luck, charisma and intelligence. Each area you travel through is described in text, and you will be presented with options as to where to explore, hide, flee, fight etc. Fights involve the gameplay moving into one-on-one beat 'em up territory, which has several moves on the C64 version but is more timing-related on the Spectrum implementation.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Beam Software", "publishers": "Melbourne House", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.62", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doc_the_Destroyer", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/95758-doc-the-destroyer\n"}
