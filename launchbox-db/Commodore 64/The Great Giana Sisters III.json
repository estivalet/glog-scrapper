{"altername_name": ["Baby Crazy"], "name": "The Great Giana Sisters III", "overview": "An unofficial entry in the Great Giana Sisters franchise, this game was created out of whole cloth by Von Laserdance of Rush using the Shoot'em-up Construction Kit and was released in SYS PD Diskett#45 (1993) and actually published in Italy under several names, including Baby Crazy in Nova Games n.24 (Ottobre 1988). It isn't a stellar outing for Laserdance as this lacks all the platforming elements beloved in this game and sticks to just the Shooter and collect-em up components. This is not a typical platform game like Giana, it's actually a SEUCK game in disguise.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Chris Yates", "publishers": "Editions Fermont", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3RCaQcq4oU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/152001-the-great-giana-sisters-iii\n"}
