{"altername_name": ["Mini Mike"], "name": "miniMIKE and the Caverns of Doom", "overview": "mini MIKE and the Caverns of Doom - A challenging C64 demo featuring a tiny character that is a bit like Load Runner, except with deadly traps. In the game you play as a little tiny man called MIKE and must traverse through each screen rescuing other tiny people while also avoiding being killed by deadly enemies and nasty spiked traps. What makes the demo so enjoyable, is not only is the game nice to look at (feels more like a modern indie game) but it's very smooth to play with responsive controls, has some well thought out challenges Can you help Mike solve the puzzles, avoid the Nasties, save his friends and escape with his life?", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2019", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Syntax Error Software", "publishers": "itch.io", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/GVVi09cNbN8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/158691-minimike-and-the-caverns-of-doom\n"}
