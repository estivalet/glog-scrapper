{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sword of Kopru", "overview": "The original game was because the names of the objects are randomly placed but the objects self remain the same. For instance it is possible you have to use the book to open the chest and that you have to read the key. Also it is impossible to leave the pit with the lion. Several fixes have been put out to resolve this issue. During the adventure game you are constantly attacked by random monsters while you struggle to return the grail to its proper home.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "B.
