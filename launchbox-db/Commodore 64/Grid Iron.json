{"altername_name": [], "name": "Grid Iron", "overview": "Any American Football team is prepared to hire you, such is your skill. Guide their team to success using the money provided. You can swap your players around the squad (once change per week only), and buy and sell players to improve your team's energy, morale and skill. Matches involve side-view highlights of touchdowns (scoring 7 points each - extra-point kicks and field goals are not included), with no tactical intervention from you. A manager status screen available after each match tells you how you're doing, including the all-important finances, which can be boosted by taking out loans.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Softstone", "publishers": "Top Ten Software", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/102856-grid-iron\n"}
