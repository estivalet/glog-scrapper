{"altername_name": [], "name": "Jimbo", "overview": "A scrolling screen platformer created by Juned Wahab and published in Magic Disk 64 1995/03. JIMBO is a cute elephant with big ears, a trunk and a problem: His cousin has been kidnapped and he is supposed to free her. To do this, he has to go through 5 exciting levels, which are peppered with enemies, traps and difficult terrain. With the help of his trunk he can throw stones at the opponents and thus eliminate them. To do this, the player must press the fire button on the joystick. He can collect bonus items and thus improve his points account. In some situations it is necessary to be more brutal against opponents. To do this, the player pushes the joystick down and Jimbo throws a boulder with which every opponent is immediately rendered harmless. Boulders are limited. Jimbo can jump quite far and even falling from great heights doesn't bother him, because he has a parachute with him that slows down the fall. The only thing is that Jimbo must not fall into the water, because he would drown in it and sacrifice one of his few screen lives.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Juned Wahab", "publishers": "CP Verlag", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6aPob1K9dg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90757-jimbo\n"}
