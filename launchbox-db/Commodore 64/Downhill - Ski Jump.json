{"altername_name": [], "name": "Downhill: Ski Jump", "overview": "A game of the notorious \"Cassette 50\" collection and also released on Digital Marketing PD #234. Pick your level of difficulty and then hit the slopes, but not too hard or they'll need to send out the Sonny Bono memorial ski patrol to scrape up what is left of you. Shoosh left and right to avoid the trees, houses and other obstacles inconveniently left on the downhill ski track. Ski Jump is a misnomer as there isn't any jumping in this game, just dodging the randomly placed obstacles. This is a challenging and possibly the most playable game in the collection, but that is relative and really not saying a great deal about the overall quality of the game.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Cascade Games", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mRQx6mziFQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/97393-downhill-ski-jump\n"}
