{"altername_name": ["Adventure B: Inca Curse"], "name": "Inca Curse", "overview": "Starting off in a South American Jungle, near an as yet undisturbed Inca temple, your aim is to enter the structure and go treasure hunting. Inside the temple is lots of such treasure (each worth a certain point value), but also traps to catch the greedy. You will encounter a Sacrificial Chamber, a Fire Room and a Pool. Gather as much treasure as possible and return to the jungle clearing to finish the adventure. The game features a simple 'Verb Noun' command interface, and no graphics of any description. Instructions such as 'break door with rock' have to be split into two commands.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Artic Computing", "publishers": "Artic Computing", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.56", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzL1511iYy4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/99650-inca-curse\n"}
