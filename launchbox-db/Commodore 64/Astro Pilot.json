{"altername_name": [], "name": "Astro Pilot", "overview": "An arcade game released as part of \"Suncom Six Pack Plus\", Suncom was heavily invested in C64 hardware, so this appears to have been a venture into the software side, this game pack came bundled with a Suncom Tac- 2 Joystick. Markings on the disk show the game developer as Imagic, though it is very unlikely if this is the same Imagic that made games for the 2600, however the time frame for this release was as Imagic was selling off property to forestall going out of business.. The game itself is a space landing simulator. The game was programmed by Trent George and Don Dennis of Suncom Australia.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Don Dennis", "publishers": "Suncom", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/87611-astro-pilot\n"}
