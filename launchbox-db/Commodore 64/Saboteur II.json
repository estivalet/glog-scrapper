{"altername_name": ["Saboteur II: Avenging Angel"], "name": "Saboteur II", "overview": "The ninja hero of the original Saboteur game has been killed, and his sister Nina is out to avenge this injustice. She has an array of kung-fu moves on offer, and must put them to use through 700 screens of action. The game design is very similar to the original, right down to the unusual background graphical style. The sections of the game are on multiple levels, separated mainly by ladders, and with lots of weapons and ammunition to pick up along the way. To beat the game you'll have to collect tapes and collect a 14-part computer code.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "February 28, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Durell Software", "publishers": "Durell Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saboteur_II:_Avenging_Angel", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpnYzr0aAM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/16889-saboteur-ii\n"}
