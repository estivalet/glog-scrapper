{"altername_name": [], "name": "Front Page", "overview": "If you are tired of zapping aliens and are looking for something a little more serious than adventure games, then your search is at an end. Front Page plunges you into a world of drama and deadlines, politics and power, a challenge that even fantasy games find hard to match. In this game of strategy and power, join the ranks of the press barons in the struggle for dominance. Set in an imaginary right-wing state headed by the none-too-enlightened President Zolo, you must walk a political tight-rope if you are to survive. In this atmosphere of intrigue and shady dealings, a scoop story could make you or break you. As Editor and Journalist you must pick and choose your stories carefully. Gossip, sensation, business news or political comment, even the most innocent comment can bring unprecedented public and political reactions.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Addison-Wesley Software", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "7", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0lpM45DVgc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/117606-front-page\n"}
