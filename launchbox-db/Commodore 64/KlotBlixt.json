{"altername_name": [], "name": "KlotBlixt", "overview": "You have been assigned to go to the sb77 space base, there to take up the battle with the dreaded space drillers. Since it has been known that the base has large stocks of polished diamonds, the base has been suffered by a continuous wave of terror and looting. Your task is to, with the help of a completely newly developed machine that can bounce back a ball lightning and allow its energy to be released on its impact against any other object that comes in the way of this powerful natural phenomenon, to say the least, take coal on the robber gangs and recover the stolen diamonds , as well as other things that you can catch up with your bounce machine. You move your bounce machine by pulling the joystick right/left. If you hold fire at the same time you can move the machine twice as fast. You can affect the sideways movement of the ball lightning by letting the ball bounce on the outer parts of the machine (outside the shock absorbers). On the right resp. Left side. You will have extreme use of this to keep the lateral displacement of the orb at a stable level, as the lateral displacement is affected when the orb hits a robber ship from below.
