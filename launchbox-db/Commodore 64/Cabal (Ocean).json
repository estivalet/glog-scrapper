{"altername_name": ["Cabal (Europe)", "Cabal (Ocean)"], "name": "Cabal (Ocean)", "overview": "This is the Ocean version of Cabal. It must keep the \"Cabal (Ocean)\" name to stay separate from the Capcom version of the game in LaunchBox. The player assumes the role of an unnamed commando trying to destroy several enemy military bases. The player's character is seen from behind and initially starts behind a protective wall (the wall can get damaged and shattered by enemy fire). The player must use a limitless ammunition gun and a limited number of grenades to fend off enemy troops and damage the base. An enemy gauge at the bottom of the screen depletes as foes are destroyed and certain structures (usually the ones that collapse when destroyed, rather than simply shattering) are brought down. At the successful completion of a level by fully depleting the enemy gauge, all the remaining buildings onscreen collapse and the player progresses to the next stage.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Special FX Software", "publishers": "Ocean Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.62", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabal_(video_game)#Ports_and_related_releases", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/2sKT-0lvYYE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6422-cabal-ocean\n"}
