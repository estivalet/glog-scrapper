{"altername_name": [], "name": "Six", "overview": "A puzzle game created by Thomas Kemmer and published in Magic Disk 64 1991/10. For everyone for whom Manta Mania was too undemanding, or who do not want to deal with manta rays on principle, SIX is certainly the right place. SIX is a pure mind game and is about symbols and colors, like so many mind games. What is really new is the clever combination of different game ideas from well-known board and computer games that already exist. But read for yourself. . You can play SIX either in pairs, namely in CHALLENGE mode, or alone in SOLITAIR mode. No matter how you play, the rules are the same. The computer gives you a stone that you have to place on the playing field. It's still very easy with the first stone, because it can be placed anywhere. For all other stones, you must now make sure that the stone matches all of its neighbors in pattern or color (or both). Otherwise you cannot get rid of the stone - and time is ticking inexorably! There are points for each stone placed. You will receive bonus points if you are able to fill a row or column. Most points are awarded if the row consists of only one color. A full row is then deleted to give the game more space. (We already know that from Tetris!) The winner is the one who can achieve the most points - the only thing in common with Manta Mania.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "October 2, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Thomas Kemmer", "publishers": "CP Verlag", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/127539-six\n"}
