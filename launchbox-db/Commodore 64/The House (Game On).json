{"altername_name": [], "name": "The House (Game On)", "overview": "A fun beginner adventure with a menu in the style of Zak McKracken or Maniac Mansion but with the ability to use the Commodore mouse 1351. Help Eddi find the inheritance of his Aunt Brunhild ('the old box') in their mansion. This may sound simple, but it is not, as Auntie has considered our 'dear Eddie' to be a good-for-nothing and daydreamer (which may be true) and has come up with some traps and many puzzles that Eddie (or you ) first has to solve in order to get to his treasure.
