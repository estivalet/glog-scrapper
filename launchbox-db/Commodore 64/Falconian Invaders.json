{"altername_name": [], "name": "Falconian Invaders", "overview": "In Falconian Invaders, you are at the console of a space fighter attempting to ward off the attacking fleet in a never ending battle to stay alive. While at the helm, you must use your joystick or track-ball to position your ship correctly in order to destroy the oncoming enemy ships. In 'regular' mode, your tracking computer will be automatically switched on to help you aim correctly. All that must be done is to position the center of any of your tracking computer's super-imposed cross-hairs and fire to ensure a direct hit. In 'advanced' mode, your tracking computer is switched off. Without it, it is up to you to gauge the correct angle at which to fire upon the enemy. For every ship you shoot down, you will receive points based on how far away the enemy was. You will also receive 10 fuel units which enables you to stay in flight indefinetely. For every ship that passes by without being destroyed, you will lose 5 fuel units. If your fuel runs out, you will lose control and crash into the planet's surface.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gregory Pratt", "publishers": "Creative Equipment", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/100271-falconian-invaders\n"}
