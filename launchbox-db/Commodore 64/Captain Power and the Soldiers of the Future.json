{"altername_name": [], "name": "Captain Power and the Soldiers of the Future", "overview": "Captain Power and the Soldiers of the Future is a 2D space shooter. Based on the '87 TV series Captain Power and the Soldiers of the Future, this computer game of the same name sends you into the year 2147. Earth is a wasteland, and the evil Lord Dread rules with an iron hand. Only a small group of high-tech soldiers under the command of the charismatic Captain Power battles the nemesis and his band of Bio Dread henchmen. None of this matters in the game though. Instead, you launch into two space shooter sequences. Part one, the training mission, has you destroy three Dread drones in a cockpit-view shooting range. Part 2, the Attack on Volcania, is a 2D sidescroller in which you eliminate approaching enemy spaceships. If enough hostiles have died, you get to bomb the enemy lair. The ship-shooting / hideout-bombing sequences are repeated until the fortresses shields are finally down. You will find more information about the Captain Power TV series in the trivia and links sections.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Anton Treuenfels", "publishers": "Box Office Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZCdKfILBTU&t=87s", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90281-captain-power-and-the-soldiers-of-the-future\n"}
