{"altername_name": [], "name": "Patience Polly", "overview": "As Polly, your task is to turn over a series of cards until it matches the one the game asks for. To turn a card over, you must highlight the card by walking underneath the bottom of it, and pressing the fire button. Depending on the number of screens you specify at the start of the game, a total of 52 cards can be in play. Some cards can reveal jokers that chase Polly around the screen, and these jokers must be avoided. If a joker catches Polly, then she goes back to the start of the current screen. Three levels, which can also be specified at the start, determine how difficult the game becomes. If neither the number of screens or the level is selected, a self-running demo shows you what you have to do, and this demo runs until Polly comes into contact with a joker.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Panther Computer Corporation", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/123913-patience-polly\n"}
