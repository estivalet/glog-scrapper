Match the colour those falling blocks and shoot them to their starting position to score points and gain levels. There are 32 levels to play, where each level will eventually get quicker after progressing well with it. There is a choice of two different types of games which you can play. One of them is to shoot a certain number of blocks to complete a level, or the other, which is a survival time limit game. Where you have to survive through a certain time limit, which you have chosen. Can you become one of the best block heads at this game? While the music is pretty good synth pop, it falls short of the name as it is definitely too bouncy for Metal.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2002", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Richard Bayliss", "publishers": "The New Dimension (TND)", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qZWknQq5HU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/104367-heavy-metal-deluxe\n"}
