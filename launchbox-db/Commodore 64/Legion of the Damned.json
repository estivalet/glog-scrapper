{"altername_name": [], "name": "Legion of the Damned", "overview": "A sideways scrolling game created with the Shoot 'Em Up Construction Kit, similar in feel to Golden Axe and a very good game. The plot is very simple: a horde of undead abominations have overrun a peaceful village, and two wandering heroes-for-hire have come along to slaughter them all and restore peace (hopefully). Player one is the Amazon (with rapid short-range sword attack) and player two is the barbarian (with a slightly underpowered but long-range throwing axe attack ... for which cowardice he is further penalized by starting the game with fewer lives). A less buggy Enhanced version was later released.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2009", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Anthony Burns", "publishers": "The New Dimension (TND)", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccsGXE3Q8hE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75935-legion-of-the-damned\n"}
