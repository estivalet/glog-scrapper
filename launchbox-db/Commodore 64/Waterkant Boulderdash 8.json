{"altername_name": ["Waterkant Dash 8"], "name": "Waterkant Boulderdash 8", "overview": "This version translates to Waterfront Dash 8, the final game in the series of 8 games known. The year of publication is unknown. The Boulder Dash Club Freudenberg was a club that was founded to swap Boulderdash games between Boulderdash fans. In that time Internet was not as important as it nowadays is, so a club like this one was pleasant for the Boulderdash players who had created own games or who wanted to play others' creations. Rolf Roth, the father of Marek Roth (who are both well-known people among the Boulderdash fans) sent all his games to the Boulder Dash Club Freudenberg. Once he won an award for the best title screens in his Boulderdash games and he got a lighter as a prize. And all you got was this nifty game series.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Peter Liepa", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/160278-waterkant-boulderdash-8\n"}
