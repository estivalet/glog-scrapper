{"altername_name": [], "name": "Falcon and the Enemy", "overview": "This arcade-style game pits your Falcon spacefighter against a horde of invading aliens, it was written by Thomas Hayes and published in both Commodore Magazine 1987/04 and in Loadstar #034. This game makes you the pilot of a XY-8 Falcon space fighter. Your mission: shoot down a squadron of enemy spacecraft intent on conquering, then colonizing, the Earth. There is no score: if even one enemy spacecraft is left after a prescribed time limit, all is lost. The easiest level has you destroy 50 ships before the timer counts down from 225. If you choose the hardest level, you will have the same amount of time to shoot down 225 ships.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "April 2, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Thomas Hayes", "publishers": "Commodore Magazine", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/100262-falcon-and-the-enemy\n"}
