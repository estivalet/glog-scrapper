Bill, setting out to build a family. He is armed with a club, with which he can hit and either stun or kill a variety of roaming creatures. These creatures include: cavewomen, who can be dragged back to the cave as \"wives\"; food with legs, which can be roasted on the fire and dragged back to the cave to feed the growing family; and dinosaurs, predators who will eat potential wives and food, and kill Bill on contact. Bill can also die from burning on the fire if he has no food, a broken heart if too many wives leave the cave, and starving to death if he is unable to feed his family.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Creative Technology Group", "publishers": "Imagine Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B.C._Bill", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSeKDJETaEI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/29755-bc-bill\n"}
