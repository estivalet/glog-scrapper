It was developed by Humphrey Walwyn and Published in 1983 by Pan Books/Person Computer News in the book Sixty Programs for the Commodore 64. You have lost the rest of your bomber squadron and are flying back to base all on your own. In the distance is an enemy plane. You're the tail-end Charlie, and as the first of your foes closes in you've got to get him in your cross-hairs and blast him out of the skies. You can fire a second burst only after the first has run its cours, and the enemy will weave about more on their run-ins as your score rises.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Humphrey Walwyn", "publishers": "Pan Books", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/121294-nightfighter\n"}
