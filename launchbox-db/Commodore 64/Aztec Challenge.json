{"altername_name": ["Aztec Challenge: Die Rituale der Azteken"], "name": "Aztec Challenge", "overview": "Suddenly you are in the capital of the Aztec Empire in 1500 A.D. You have been sentenced to be a ritual sacrifice to their gods, and your only chance of escape is to complete an obstacle course known as \"THE AZTEC CHALLENGE\" The player must reach and explore an Aztec temple while avoiding a variety of dangerous obstacles. Each level is like a whole different game, with different challenges and different types of scrolling and exploration. The game starts with an over-the-shoulder view of the player running a gauntlet of spear-throwing natives towards a pyramid which rises on the horizon. Once this is reached, a vertically-scrolling staircase with falling rocks must be traversed, and then there are rooms to explore and deadly aquatic wildlife to avoid (among other dangers) before the game is through. Players looking for the adventuring equivalent of an Epyx sports game should enjoy this one. There are seven levels to conquer in order to complete the game.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "July 1, 1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Cosmi", "publishers": "Cosmi", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.97", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec_Challenge", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsT1Ib7XGws", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6485-aztec-challenge\n"}
