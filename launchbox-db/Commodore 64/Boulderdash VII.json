{"altername_name": ["Boulder Dash 07", "Boulder Dash 7"], "name": "Boulderdash VII", "overview": "Boulderdash VII, The old Rockford in new caves aka Boulder Dash 7. You are Rockford, and you have to dig through monster infested caves in search of diamonds. In each level you must collect a certain number of these diamonds, in order to open a portal to the next stage. Enemies can be squashed by falling boulders, which are released when the ground below them is removed or they are pushed onto empty ground, but be careful because these can also squash you. In later levels, difficulty is increased by many puzzle elements and shorter time limits.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Don Pedro", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlNQAooUTE8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/129940-boulderdash-vii\n"}
