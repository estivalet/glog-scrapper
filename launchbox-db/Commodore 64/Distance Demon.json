{"altername_name": ["Distance Demons"], "name": "Distance Demon", "overview": "In this horizontal scrolling driving game viewed from the side at an elevated angle with the screen scrolling constantly from left to right, you must drive and overtake other cars. The aim is to drive for as many laps as possible while trying to get the biggest score that you can. You start driving at 60 and once you go above 100 then your score increases and the faster you go the quicker your score increases. You can move up or down, and left or right, and if you hit another car or the sides of the track then you lose one of three lives and have to start again.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Todd Hooper", "publishers": "Dotsoft", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ioVCeUixp0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/96586-distance-demon\n"}
