{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hollywood Squares", "overview": "This is a GameTek conversion of the '80s version of the game show Hollywood Squares. Two contestants play a version of tic-tac-toe, with \"celebrities\" filling in for the squares. The selected celeb is asked a question, answers it, and the contestant must agree or disagree with their answer. A correct guess captures that square. After three games, the winning contestant picks a key and a car out of two separate pools, hoping to match the two up and win the car.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "GameTek", "publishers": "GameTek", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "0.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/105278-hollywood-squares\n"}
