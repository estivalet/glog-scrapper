{"altername_name": ["V-GA"], "name": "V-Ga", "overview": "This is a horizontal-scrolling shooter that consist of only three stages. The aim is to guide your ship, shooting any airborne enemies that come your way. You have a single pistol that you can use to destroy them, but by shooting an entire group your weapon can be upgraded to twin shots. Shooting enemies drain the weapon's energy; and when there is no energy left, you have to wait for a number of seconds before you can shoot again. Contact with enemies results in a loss of life and whatever weapon you are using will be lost. The game ends when you lose all your ships.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Frank Kl\u00f6ckner", "publishers": "Magic Disk", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pog_HcR6Zjk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/76157-v-ga\n"}
