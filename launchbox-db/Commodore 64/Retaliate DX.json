{"altername_name": [], "name": "Retaliate DX", "overview": "As the last survivor of the Battle for Io, your space craft tumbles through the blackness, heavily scarred from conflict with its ammunition depleted. Stranded in the outer Solar System, the closest haven is an Earth-Martian alliance military station in orbit around the red planet - but between you and safety are countless enemy probes and escorts, deadly space mines and treacherous asteroid fields. Stay alert on your journey back home; heavily armed enemy destroyers and sonar ships patrol the outer planets, hunting for easy prey. However, if you can make it back in one piece, fame, glory and medals await you. Valiant space hero, let's face the hard reality; failure is almost certain, but surrender is not an option. You'll need to use all the skills you gained during your time at the Martian Space Academy - weave and dodge through the enemy formations, equip your shield to absorb enemy fire and RETALIATE!
