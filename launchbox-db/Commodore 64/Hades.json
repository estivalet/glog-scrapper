{"altername_name": ["Mabee"], "name": "Hades", "overview": "Nice little scrolling screen platfomer written as a hobby project for the Micro Masters Holland Competition. Following a curse by the wicked witch Prosperina, all the gold of the good Rel Zold was transported to Hades and scattered everywhere. To save the honor of the kingdom of your beloved King Zold, you take on the mantle of Hercules and descend into the dark realm. Collect all the coins but be very careful to avoid falling into a thousand pitfalls, otherwise you will become a resident instead of a visitor. If you are very lucky you can also redeem the final treasure and return as a rich hero amongst the mortals.
