{"altername_name": ["3D Roam"], "name": "3D-Roam", "overview": "A snake clone published by Swedish based Handic Software, and the graphics and programming were done by Arne Fernlund. This game is a little different from your standard snake clone however, as you are in outer space and have to contend with all sorts of baddies trying to kill you. Very Trippy graphics reminiscent of Jeff Minter's games. If you press F1 to start the game, it would make the graphics flash and glow, which allows you to play the game with 3D Glasses.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Arne Fernlund", "publishers": "Handic Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.38", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-JHlPDbSdU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86546-3d-roam\n"}
