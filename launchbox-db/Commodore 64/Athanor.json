In this first part, you play as a Franciscan monk in early 12th century Italy. A lost abbey seems agitated by suspicious events. Your order sends you to investigate and understand what is disturbing the monks. Is this investigation the real motivation to take you on this journey? You'll find out, but no matter what, fear not, your journey will surely take you further than you ever imagined. \"Do you have a whole night? \" If so, insert your floppy disk and browse through the first places. You will not switch off until the early morning hours after having experienced hours of intense fever.
