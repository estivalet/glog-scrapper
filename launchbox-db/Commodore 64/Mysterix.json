The aim of the game is to collect all the points on the screen in order to reach the next level. However, four monsters try to thwart this. Fortunately, there are power pills that Mysterix can take, whereupon the monsters turn blue and Mysterix can eat them. The eaten monsters cannot harm the hero until they transform back into shape.
