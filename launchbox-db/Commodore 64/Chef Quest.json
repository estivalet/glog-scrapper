{"altername_name": [], "name": "Chef Quest", "overview": "Oh no! Chef is out of ingredients so it's time to venture into the restaurant's dungeon to restock the larder with delicious monsters. Chef Quest is a tiny, action-oriented RPG of culinary delights. Chef Quest was my entry for the RESET 64 4kb Competition (2018). Despite appearances and tiny file size there's a bit of depth to how the game works (which confused most people, and is a good lesson that hopefully I learn one day). It is highly recommended you read the instructions first before playing.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2018", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Privy Software", "publishers": "Reset64 Magazine", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ0OFwnviug", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/367985-chef-quest\n"}
