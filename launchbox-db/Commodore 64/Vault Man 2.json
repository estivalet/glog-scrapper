{"altername_name": ["Vault Man II"], "name": "Vault Man 2", "overview": "An arcade platformer and sequel to the original Vault Man, both by Charles Grey. The aim of this game is to collect as many of the golden bars in the level as possible and bring them to the vault door. Be warned though, as it's a vault containing deadly monsters and there's a lack of oxygen, if you don't return to the door in time you'll pass out and die! What makes this game rather unique over most C64 games is the ability to push platforms up or down to reach certain areas. So if a platform is too low, go underneath it and push it up. And that's pretty much it, push the platforms, grab the gold bars, try not to run out of air and win the level. Just try not end up like me and get frustrated at moving the blocks the wrong way, again and again.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2017", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Charles Grey", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaQd43GOJek", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/167353-vault-man-2\n"}
