{"altername_name": [], "name": "Explorer II", "overview": "A horizontally scrolling shooter created by Gabriel Winkler and released in Homecomputer 1986/06-07. That was the last radio message from our scout ship SURVIVOR, operating in the galaxy MI3. Apparently the Agamers intend to break the intergalactic truce in order to continue the enslavement of the galaxy. Only TERRA is strong enough to put the mighty enemy in his place, because the allied planets are still too weakened from the last war to be able to do anything against the Agamers. However, we also have our problems, because some of our fleet is still scattered throughout the galaxy and the pitiful remainder is not fully operational either. Therefore we need enough time to mobilize our forces. Time we don't have, for the An-eriil of the Agamer could come at any moment, and we would be left defenseless to face It is therefore your task to launch a surprise attack on the Agamer planet, which should distract them from their plan, until we have assembled enough powerful units. The aim of this game is to destroy as much as possible with your \"heavy cruiser\" on the Apamer planet, to confuse the enemy in order to distract him from his actual plan. This is not an easy undertaking, you will certainly soon notice because you will not only be hit by planetary \u00c4defense forts and heavily fired upon, but pursued by those that wish to destroy you, the entire Agami air force!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gabriel Winkler", "publishers": "Tronic Verlag GmbH", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/99934-explorer-ii\n"}
