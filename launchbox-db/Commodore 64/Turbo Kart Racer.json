{"altername_name": ["Turbo Kart Racing"], "name": "Turbo Kart Racer", "overview": "Grab a Go-Kart and race another driver, friend or computer across various tracks to become champion. The game is viewed from overhead showing a small part of the track on a split screen. As well as normal acceleration you can also use turbo which is limited. There are various icons scattered around the tracks which repair damage and keep your turbo topped up. The car who gets an icon flashes. Also driving around the track is a grey car and if it's holding a spanner can be crashed into to collect the spanner. The winner of each race also takes any spanners the loser has collected. The joystick is used to drive your kart.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Paul Black", "publishers": "Players Software", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fi3wKqpRdXU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/114145-turbo-kart-racer\n"}
