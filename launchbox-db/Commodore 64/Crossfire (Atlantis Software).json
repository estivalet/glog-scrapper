You must visit nine locations and shoot all the bad guys that appear on the screen in various places, by controlling a cross-hair and shooting them. Civilian's also appear and these cannot be shot or you lose points at the end of each location. To complete a location you must stay alive while a timer counts down, and when it reaches zero then you move to the next location. As you shoot, the bad guys will shoot back after a short time and if you are hit then you lose one of four lives and the location starts again.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Pantheon Software", "publishers": "Atlantis Software Ltd.", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/95007-crossfire-atlantis-software\n"}
