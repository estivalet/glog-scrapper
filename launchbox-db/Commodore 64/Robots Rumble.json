You will be sent to different planets guiding the broken robots through different scenarios, your mission, throw them into the lava with the exclusive help of two old big magnets. You must avoid the green stones of kryptonite (the robot will explode causing pollution of the entire planet). You must avoid the sentinels of the plant as well. The magnets have a limited battery charge. They can be charged by picking up the batteries on the map. If you run out of energy, you die. If both magnets are aligned with the robot, it will stop moving. You can use mobile platforms to fill gaps, break glass floors, climb through light lifts, use teleportation, etc. The game features musical covers of well-known electronic music pieces, including Kraftwerk's The Robots, and Georgio Moroder's Chase theme from the movie Midnight Express.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "May 28, 2019", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Digital Monastery", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R08azrUBJyA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/130654-robots-rumble\n"}
