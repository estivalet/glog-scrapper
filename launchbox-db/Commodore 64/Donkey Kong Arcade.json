{"altername_name": ["Donkey Kong X2016", "X2016 Donkey Kong"], "name": "Donkey Kong Arcade", "overview": "Mario (originally named Mr.Video and then Jumpman) must rescue a damsel in distress named Pauline, from a giant ape named Donkey Kong. The hero and ape later became two of Nintendo\u2019s most popular and recognizable characters. Donkey Kong is one of the most important titles from the Golden Age of Arcade Gaming, and is one of the most popular arcade games of all time. So we welcome with open arms, a new remade version for the Commodore 64. Oxyron have done a fantastic job while still keeping the feel of the original Arcade version. Noticeable changes in this remake are graphics and layout. A beautiful intro screen and some unique cutesy sprites make this version stand out from the rest, and a LOT prettier and smoother gameplay than the two original C64 releases, (Atarisoft, Ocean). Little Mario has never looked better with his red cap and big nose.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2016", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Oxyron", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGTGMufNSwM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/127471-donkey-kong-arcade\n"}
