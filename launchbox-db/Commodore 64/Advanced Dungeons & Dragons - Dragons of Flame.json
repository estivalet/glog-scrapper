This game follows the tradition of Heroes of the Lance with a side-scrolling, action-oriented view, a breakaway from the standard GoldBox RPGs. Plot-wise, it also takes place between those two games, following closely the novel/game modules written by Weiss/Hickman. You take control of one character at a time, with each hero having different abilities.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "U.S. Gold", "publishers": "Strategic Simulations", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.72", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragons_of_Flame_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rWz9iefl1g", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86682-advanced-dungeons-dragons-dragons-of-flame\n"}
