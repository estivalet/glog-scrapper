{"altername_name": [], "name": "Davy Jones Locker", "overview": "Davy Jones Locker is a text adventure set on the high seas. On August 11th 1927 the clipper Allana was lost at sea, only one lifeboat containing five people survived. This game puts the player in that lifeboat along with Big Jake, Pedro, Shamus, an unnamed woman, and a small dog. The survivors are drifting in the vast ocean when, from out of the mist, a ship comes slowly towards them. Are they rescued, or is something sinister about to happen? This game was developed using the Professional Adventure Writer. It supports the standard shortcuts such as N/S/E/W for North/South/East/West as well as more complex commands such as 'PICK UP THE PUMP, EXAMINE IT THEN PUMP UP THE DINGHY' or 'SAY \"HELLO\" AND GET EVERYTHING BUT THE GEL'. The HELP command brings up a list of puzzles/items, each with a coded hint. The game was released on a dual pack along with The Challenge.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jack A.
