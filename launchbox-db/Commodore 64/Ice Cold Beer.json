{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ice Cold Beer", "overview": "In 1983, Taito released the mechanical arcade game \"Ice Cold Beer\". It sports a playfield dotted with holes, simulating the bubbles of a big glass of frothing, ice cold beer. On each stage, one of the holes will light up, and using a joystick on either side, you tilt a metal bar to maneuver a ball into the right hole. If you hit the lit hole, you move on to the next stage. Today, in 2019, Megastyle proudly presents a digital version of this great classic, especially made for the Commodore 64 Personal Micro Computer. To enjoy this game, you will need either two joysticks in each port, a joystick and keyboard, or you can play it using the keyboard only. Tilt the bar back and forth to nudge the ball into the lit hole, while avoiding the others. When the ball is deposited, the ball and bar return to the bottom of the playfield, and the next target lights up. Controls: Press SPACE to start the game Joystick port 1 or keys Q+A controls the left side of the bar Joystick port 2 or keys P+L controls the right side of the bar Credits: Ice Cold Beer c64 was made by Jamie Fuller.
