Now 1-4 players can enjoy all the thrills of the Wrestling action you have been watching on TV, but now on your home computer! With the unique 2-4 player Tag Team Mode you can invite up to 3 of your best friends or 3 of your worst enemies to join you in the ring. If you have been slammed one too many times then make your way to the corner and tag your teammate's hand. Now you can rest while your partner tries to pin the opponent. Use Pro Moves like the Pile Driver and the Body Slam off the rope. Elbow drops, back breakers and drop kicks are all fair game.
