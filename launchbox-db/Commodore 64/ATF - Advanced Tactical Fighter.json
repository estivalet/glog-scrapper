{"altername_name": [], "name": "ATF: Advanced Tactical Fighter", "overview": "The display is a third-person view showing the player's ATF, which remains stationary on screen as the scenery scrolls past it, which takes up most of the screen. A head-up display is superimposed on the main screen; this shows engine thrust, the ATF's speed, ground height and altitude, along with the missile system available, direction of flight and a target's range and bearing. The right-hand side is devoted to the \"on-board flight computer\" which shows enemy positions on a world map, the status of weapon systems and the ATF itself. Above the flight computer display is a panel which shows the score and number of lives left.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "July 15, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ian Beynon, Neil Coxhead, Kevin J.
