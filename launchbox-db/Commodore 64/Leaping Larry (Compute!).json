In this fast-paced action game, your goal is to retrieve important plans from a futuristic factory filled with nasty hazards. In \"Leaping Larry,\" you're an apprentice inventor in a future world. One evening after leaving the factory, you realize that you've left behind three sets of important plans that you intended to take home. You return to the factory, but the security robots \u2014 which can be quite dangerous \u2014 are patrolling, and you don't know how to turn them off. And the elevators have been shut down, so the only way to move from the ground floor to the top floor \u2014 where the most important plans are stored \u2014 is by riding a series of moving conveyor belts, each on a different floor. The only way to avoid the robots and move from floor to floor on the belts is by leaping.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Michael Streeter", "publishers": "COMPUTE!
