{"altername_name": ["Lotac"], "name": "Zynon", "overview": "A horizontally scrolling shooter from Ian Jones & Michael Jones. The Interplanetary Federation has decided to make a raid on the Zynon-Lotec platform which a small group of rebels uses as a starting point to carry out their retaliatory actions. The plan is to land you on the platform about a mega-crawler. At this point you will have to penetrate into enemy territory and aim directly at the rebel headquarters. Of course, you won't find it easy. Many previous attempts, however, have allowed the rebels to gather information on the type of protection that the rebels have set up to defend their headquarters. As soon as you land you will be attacked by constant waves of enemy fighters. While you are defending yourself you will have to pay close attenton to where you move to avoid falling into the traps prepared to block you.
