{"altername_name": [], "name": "Aniso", "overview": "Aniso is a puzzle\\brain game created by Henrik J. Reiman and published in 2001. It presents a skillfully crafted puzzle. You are given a target image on the right, it has the numbers all in the configuration you want. You need to match your square with that same pattern. When you click in the left section it adds a 1 to that square, you cannot click the same square again to change it. It can only be changed through interactions with the squares around it. Say you click to the one right below it, that square gets a 1 and all the squares around it increment up by one, making your original 1 into a 2. So you must start by placing the highest numbers and once you put a number in the last place, the game is finished. If you have matched you win, if you have fallen short, you can try again. Beware, 4s will wrap around to 1's if you increment them again. Good luck!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2001", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Henrik J.
