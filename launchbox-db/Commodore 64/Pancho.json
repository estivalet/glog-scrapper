{"altername_name": ["Pancho", "Miguel", "Hombre"], "name": "Pancho", "overview": "A Q-bert style action puzzle game that was part of the French \"3 Super Jeux\" game pack. Inspired by the arcade game Q*Bert, you take the role of Pancho who has to paint all the squares on various heights in a isometric view on a single screen. To paint a square, all Pancho has to do is land on a square but needs to avoid a Mad Mexican Muncher that moves around the screen and if he touches it then he loses one of three lives. Also moving around the screen is a wild jumping bean that changes the squares back to their original colour but this can be caught to remove it. Pancho starts a level on one of two magic carpets and these can be stood on to have a breather as the Muncher can't land on them. Pressing the fire button anywhere on the screen transports Pancho on to one but this can only be done four times. Once the level has been cleared then it's onto the next one but with more Munchers and the squares have to be landed on more than once to paint them.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Olivier Barthelemy", "publishers": "Data Becker GmbH", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyBFU6oGgME", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/123427-pancho\n"}
