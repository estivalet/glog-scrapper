{"altername_name": [], "name": "Frogs", "overview": "It's spring time again, and the FROGS are hanging around at the pond, listening to funky freestyle music and trying to prove who's the coolest of them all. For this, they are competing in some funny competitions, which you can re-enact using your Commodore C64/C128, in a group of up to 4 players! Throw your froggy friends into the pond by slapping them with your tongue, or eat all those tasty bugs before the other players are able to catch them! This great action game supports the \"Classical Games 4-Player Interface\", which you can buy online for little money, or you can even build one by yourself.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "March 30, 2017", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Christian Gleinser", "publishers": "Dr. Wuro Industries", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvNqIorefQE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/117745-frogs\n"}
