{"altername_name": [], "name": "Nibbly '92", "overview": "Nibbly '92 is a worm/nibble/snake game, where the player controls a growing snake while eating dots in an enclosed maze. The maze is contained on a single screen, and the snake must eat all the dots without being blocked by its own body, in order to get to the next screen with a new maze. When sixteen levels have been played, the game repeats the mazes with more difficulty for the player by increasing the snake growth, until eventually the maze becomes impossible to solve. This game is the predecessor to Super Nibbly.
