{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hirnris", "overview": "A head-to-head Tetris clone published in Magic Disk 64 1993/07 and also in Tiger-Crew-Disk #10 (1995/01). The name says it all. In this game you really have to be careful not to lose control of yourself and sit in front of the monitor for hours. Addiction factor 1! \"Hirnris\" is an implementation of the game \"Tetris\", which is actually still on everyone's lips. The principle of the game should therefore be well known. \"Hirnris\" was divided into different rounds. The aim of a round is to fill the number of lines indicated under the respective playing field. Once this has happened, the bonus is added to the score and the next round can begin. The game comes to an end when the playing field is so full that there is no more space for new stones. If you have reached a high score, you can enter your name and immortalize it for all time. The game controls: The falling stones can be moved to a limited extent with the joystick, whereby the following operations are possible. Joystick to the right or left: - Push stones to the left or right Joystick down: - Increase the speed of fall Joystick up - Activate pause mode Fire button - Rotate the stone 90 degrees", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Lars Hutzelmann", "publishers": "CP Verlag", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YMzxICO8uE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/105260-hirnris\n"}
