{"altername_name": [], "name": "Matrix (Softdisk Publishing)", "overview": "In Matrix you can find word and word sets in the Byoggle-like matrix of letters and score them in this game from James Speers, for one to 6 players. It was originally released in UpTime Vol.1 #09 a monthly disk magazine for the c64/128 featuring programs, tutorials, articles and reviews. The object of the game is to find as many 4-letter or longer words as you can in a 5x5 maze of random letters within a set time limit. The game is competitive with each player using the same maze and time. Score is higher for longer words, and ONLY words not used by any other players will be scored. The letter Q in the maze works as Qu to make things easier. You may start with any letter and each letter in the word must adjoin the previous one horizontally diagonally or vertically. No letter may be used twice in the same word. Plurals, past tense, etc are all counted as separate words.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "James Speers", "publishers": "Softdisk Publishing", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "6", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/121951-matrix-softdisk-publishing\n"}
