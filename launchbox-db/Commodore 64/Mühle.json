{"altername_name": [], "name": "M\u00fchle", "overview": "Published in 64'er 1994/07, this is a game version of M\u00fchle, also known as Nine Men's Morris or Merels. Nine Men's Morris, also known as Merrills, Mill and Merels, is an old English game that goes back to antiquity - evidence has been found for the game in ancient Rome and possibly Ancient Egypt. More recently, references in the works of Shakespeare have given it an image of the archetypal medieval board game. Like most of the best games, Nine Mens Morris rules are simple, the objective being to capture opposing pieces by forming lines of 3. It is an under-rated game of skill that is easy to learn but sometimes requiring deep thought - a bit like grown-up tic-tac-toe (or noughts and crosses). It is an entertaining game for beginners and veterans alike and something for older children and adults to enjoy.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Art Project Studios", "publishers": "Magna Media", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVu36L4Pjw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/122798-muhle\n"}
