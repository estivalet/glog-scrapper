Poor Snodge the Biblet... just when we thought things were bad, the worst is yet to come for our poor herd. He has been captured and thrown into the deepest depths of the water. It is up to you to help poor Snodge try and reach the banks of the 4 challenging stages. All is not easy though, as there are deadly creatures that live in the deep water. Luckily for Snodge, he can make bubbles that can kill those deadly creatures. Watch out, as they can fight back! If you are careful enough, you will succeed!
