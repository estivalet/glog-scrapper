{"altername_name": [], "name": "Boggles: The Mind Boggler", "overview": "A game of the \"Cassette 50\" collection. Begins with your choice of two games, Master Logic and Letter Jumble: Master Logic: A Mastermind clone. You can set your level of difficulty 1 to 9. The object is to find the target number in the least possible turns with clues given on the right. Blue indicates the correct amount of numbers, Red the correct amount of places. So the goal is 4-4 where you have the right numbers in the right places in a level 4 game (there are four number places in the level 4 difficulty game, 9 in the level 9 where the goal would be 9-9 for success. Letter Jumble: The computer will present a word where the letters have been jumbled up, you guess the word. The game has 3 levels of difficulty, where 3 is very difficult. You will be counted off for every incorrect letter you try to guess. Like golf, low score is best.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Cascade Games", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbCYB_6qeT4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/89776-boggles-the-mind-boggler\n"}
