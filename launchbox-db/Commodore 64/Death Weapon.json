{"altername_name": [], "name": "Death Weapon", "overview": "Developed and released by Jason Kelk in 2019 Yet another entry in this year's RGCD 2019 16K Cartridge Competition, Jason Kelk turns in this addictive arcade game. It might look simplistic, but your ship can only fire whilst moving backwards, so you need to keep on top of positioning and move when appropriate to maintain angles on the enemy ships as they spawn. Each round increases the speed at which the ships spawn, and you'll really need to be on your toes from round 6 onward; it's very easy to lose your sense of timing and for success to slip your grasp!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "June 30, 2019", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jason Kelk", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2y0dc2Sjbc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/118565-death-weapon\n"}
