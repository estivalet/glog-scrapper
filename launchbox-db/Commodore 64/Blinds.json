{"altername_name": [], "name": "Blinds", "overview": "Charles Grey (Iceout) has a new game for the Commodore C64. The game is very small, it is only 256 Bytes. That is only 1 block to disk. In the game you have to top them up with the bottom. You can adjust the patterns using the joystick (left / right) or the reverse pattern (up / down). If the two patterns are correct you can add them together with the fire button.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2012", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Charles Grey", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/368034-blinds\n"}
