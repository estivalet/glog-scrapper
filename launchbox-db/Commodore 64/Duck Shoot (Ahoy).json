{"altername_name": [], "name": "Duck Shoot (Ahoy)", "overview": "Shooting game by Bob Blackmer and released in Ahoy! 1985/06 (Issue #18) and in 75 Spill Datatronic. Duck Shoot is a colorful arcade-style shooting gallery, inspired by the old carnival game. You simply aim your gun sights at the ducks on the screen and fire. Shooting down ten ducks will put you in a timed target round, consisting of a series of targets that appear on the screen for brief periods. The higher your score, the faster the required reaction time. If four ducks in a row get by, the game ends and your score and the high score are displayed. The duck's speed will increase as you progress through the rounds. Ducks are worth 25 points each, and the targets are worth 50 points each. There are eight target rounds, after which the game becomes a flurry of ducks moving faster and faster until the game ends.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bob Blackmer", "publishers": "Ion International, Inc.", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STrhVNX0H9g", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/97818-duck-shoot-ahoy\n"}
