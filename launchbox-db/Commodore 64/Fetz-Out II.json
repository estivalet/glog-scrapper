{"altername_name": ["Fetz-Out 2"], "name": "Fetz-Out II", "overview": "A punishingly fast single screen shooter where a wave of enemies cycle past you in a loop until you destroy them all and can move on to the next wave. Created by Ingo Sander and published in Magic Disk 64 1988/11, Digital Marketing PD #156. Fetz-Out 2 is a game that primarily depends on quick reactions. The game doesn't need much explanation. All you need is a joystick in port 2 and a quick response. When you have completed one level, you will move on to the next one. If your ship is destroyed, you have to start again from the beginning.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ingo Sander", "publishers": "CP Verlag", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOxPU2K7YC0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/100496-fetz-out-ii\n"}
