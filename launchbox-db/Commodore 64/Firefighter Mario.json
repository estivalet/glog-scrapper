{"altername_name": [], "name": "Firefighter Mario", "overview": "Firefighter Mario is a Vanguard clone, with Mario in a firetruck \u2013 having to put out fireball enemies, and then destroy a large flame on top of a building. The game scrolls in a variety of directions, just like Vanguard. It\u2019s not the best game in the world, but for 1983 and 4K, you cannot really complain! The game was developed by Jeremy Thorne and scheduled to be published by Mr. Computer Products in 1983, but was cancelled due to concerns over legal action from Nintendo.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jeremy Thorne", "publishers": "Unreleased Prototype", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtube.com/watch?v=ehKOaahfeS8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/158603-firefighter-mario\n"}
