Developed by Jon Mattson and published in the following - Loadstar #049 - The Compleat Jon In Robot Rescue, you assume the role of the Robot named Mandar II. You possess the power to transmit your electronic consciousness to host computers allowing you to see and act through remote probe droids. You are, in effect, immortal as long as you have hosts to possess. The government has, yet again come to you with a problem. Several days ago, a group of Terran ambassadors was kidnapped by Vordax terrorists while on a mission to Vorda. The Vordax government has barred Terrans from landing and refuses any Terran intervention, stating that any unwelcome attempt to land on Vordax soil will be treated as an act of war. Thus, a daring, officially unsanctioned plan has been devised to bring the ambassadors home. A plan which requires your special talents to succeed. You will be sent to Vorda, and control the local droids while you locate and, if possible, free each captured diplomat. Since the rescue ship must avoid detection at all costs, you will be racing against the clock. Arrayed against you are a large number of defense mechanisms. Only you have the skills to save the diplomats.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jon Mattson", "publishers": "Softdisk Publishing", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd81SBX0I8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/158441-robot-rescue\n"}
