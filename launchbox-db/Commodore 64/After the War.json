{"altername_name": [], "name": "After the War", "overview": "The year is 2019, Manhattan. After a nuclear war. Out of the ashes comes a hero, Jonathan Rogers, better known as \"Jungle Rogers\", the owner of the asphalt jungle. The only chance of survival is to reach the airdrop platform XV-238, located in the control base of the schizophrenic assassin professor McJerin, and to escape to outer colonies. There is no easy way to do this. The game is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up, with thugs coming at you constantly, and a few moves to use on them. You must cross the dangerous streets of Manhattan, which have become overrun by feral thieves. Later you await the guardians of the scientific complex of McJerin.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "August 15, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Luis Mariano Garc\u00eda", "publishers": "Dinamic Software", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.62", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/After_the_War_%28video_game%29", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tthgyy23_d0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/32090-after-the-war\n"}
