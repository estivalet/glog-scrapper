{"altername_name": [], "name": "Breakie Break Out", "overview": "A breakout game created in 1988 using the breakout construction kit. It appears to have been intended to be a VS breakout game, with blocks in the middle to break through and blocks behind your bat to protect on both top and bottom. When one side is broken enough to let a ball pass through it moves to the next level. However, second player support is unfinished and if you only have one joystick plugged in, it will mirror movements on the top and bottom. Since the balls start out on roughly mirrored trajectories, if you can keep the balls hitting in the very center of the bat you can mirror it for a while, but hit on the ends and the symmetry stops and chaos begins.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Breakie", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/158517-breakie-break-out\n"}
