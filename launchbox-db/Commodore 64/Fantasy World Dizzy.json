The game is considered the third in the Dizzy series and was developed under the name Dizzy III. The actual third game in the series (Fast Food) was regarded as a spin-off which deviated from the standard Dizzy format. Fantasy World Dizzy was the first Dizzy adventure to feature many elements which later became standard for the series, such as having three lives, an improved inventory system and a balance between puzzle-solving and hazards. This game also introduced the Yolkfolk: Daisy, Denzil, Dozy, Dylan and Grand-Dizzy.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "January 1, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Codemasters", "publishers": "Codemasters", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.64", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy_World_Dizzy", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcMDwHkm9k", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/32376-fantasy-world-dizzy\n"}
