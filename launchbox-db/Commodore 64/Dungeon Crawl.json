{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dungeon Crawl", "overview": "Dungeon Crawl is a simplified maze RPG game similar to rogue-like RPGs, except that in Dungeon Crawl the dungeon is always the same and not randomly generated. To make progress through the dungeon and reach the next dungeon levels, the player has to find keys to unlock doors and find buttons which opens up formerly inaccessible sections. Typical fantasy monsters roam the dungeon, often blocking your path. Killing them gives XP, which is needed to further improve your characters attack and defense values.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "May 24, 2015", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tom-Willy Wilhelmsen", "publishers": "", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/169869-dungeon-crawl\n"}
