{"altername_name": ["Bosconian 87"], "name": "Bosconian '87", "overview": "This older arcade game got a budget-priced home conversion. Fighting it out above the earth for a newly-reunited people, you must shoot out the alien craft to depend your people. The game is a top-down shoot 'em up, with aliens to kill and rocks to destroy. Each wave has several Space Stations, and destroying these is the ultimate goal. A scanner helps you find these. The ship can be brought to a stop, or flown in any of the four main directions. You must watch the fuel gauge, but extra fuel and improved weapons can be collected. There is a mothership which can be docked with for shielding.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Binary Design", "publishers": "Mastertronic Ltd.", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpHX2KO0_Js", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/89916-bosconian-87\n"}
