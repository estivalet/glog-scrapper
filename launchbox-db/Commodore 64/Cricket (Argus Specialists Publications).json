{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cricket (Argus Specialists Publications)", "overview": "Published in Computer Gamer 1986/07 (Issue #16). Cricket is an arcade version of the popular sport. You have five men with whom you must score as many runs as possible. You must first choose fielder and bowler speed, higher numbers mean a more difficult game. The pitch appears and you must face the first ball. Check the position of the fielders and choose to hit the ball up or down the screen. On slower bowlers you might have two tries to hit the lobbed ball. After you hit the ball you gain temporary control of it and can avoid fielders to give yourself a better chance. When it crosses the boundary you'll be told how many runs (1 to 6) you scored. If a ball touches the fielder it is a catch and you are out.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Andrew Clarke", "publishers": "Argus Specialist Publications", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/94963-cricket-argus-specialists-publications\n"}
