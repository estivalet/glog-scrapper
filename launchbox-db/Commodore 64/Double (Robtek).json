{"altername_name": ["Hebbes"], "name": "Double (Robtek)", "overview": "A dice betting game for up to 5 people, released in 1986 by Robtek, the author is currently unknown. Double is a game that allows 2 to 5 players. The idea is to get as many points as possible. Each time it is your turn you can roll the dice as many times as you want. If the total rolled is the same as the previous turn then you have thrown a double. This means that your score is zeroed out. Then the next person can go. If the total from the dice is not equal to the previous go then you can roll the dice as many times as you want. The total will be added to your previous score.
