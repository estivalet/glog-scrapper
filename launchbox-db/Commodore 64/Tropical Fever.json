{"altername_name": ["Caccia Grossa"], "name": "Tropical Fever", "overview": "A 2D single full screen maze where a hunter had to catch back a bunch of animals escaped from a big cage located in the center of the screen (monkeys, lions, birds). The hunter had to use some bananas found along the maze path to attract monkeys and push them back into the cage. A brave hunter finds himself in a jungle inhabited by wild animals that he must capture and take to the protective animal habitat. After you have captured the panther, you will need to cage it. You will then be able to move to another area of the jungle to catch the gorilla. To stop you have a chance: press the fire button on your joystick: the water will allow you to continue the hunt. Occasionally a bonus will appear on the screen, be quick and catch it! When you run out of water, you can refuel in a special container. You have three lives to complete your mission. When he finally manages to catch the gorilla, there will be other animals even more ferocious and difficult to hunt. If you manage to complete this difficult mission, you will take all the animals to the protective animal habitat. You will thus receive a prize for your skill and may even rate entry to the list of great previous scores!
