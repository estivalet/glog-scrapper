{"altername_name": [], "name": "Crazy Jogger", "overview": "In Crazy Jogger, a Multisoft game by J\u00f6rg Tuttas you run along the beach avoiding all the wildlife there by jumping and ducking and see if you have what it takes to go the full distance. When you get to the end of the beach path, as noted by the distance marker, you go to the next level. In the bonus levels between each jogging level, you must try to catch the falling drinks and other items. Then on to the forest where creepy crawlies, porcupines and forest birds try to catch you. The nighttime level has crows, bats and bullfrogs to avoid, along with the other creatures.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "J\u00f6rg Tuttas", "publishers": "Multisoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3vb7HNCuZw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/94300-crazy-jogger\n"}
