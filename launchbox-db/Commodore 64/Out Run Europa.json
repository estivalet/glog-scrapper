{"altername_name": [], "name": "Out Run Europa", "overview": "The third game in the OutRun series, which revolutionised the third-person perspective style of racing games. The levels are set across Europe, as you bid to escape from the police. Unlike other titles in the series, you use a different vehicle on each level, with motorbikes and jet-skis adding variety and taking different skill to use. You must complete each level within the strict time limits, and the routes are dogged with other vehicles to avoid and overtake. You can choose between sound effects or music. Out Run Europa (known as Out Run Europe during development), is a driving video game developed by Probe Software and published by U.S. Gold for the Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64, Game Gear, Sega Master System and ZX Spectrum in 1991. It is a spinoff to the arcade game Out Run, though it was not produced by Sega.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Probe Software", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.33", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_Run_Europa", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kTGnaBfsW8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/96791-out-run-europa\n"}
