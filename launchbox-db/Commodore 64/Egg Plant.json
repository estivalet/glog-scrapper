{"altername_name": [], "name": "Egg Plant", "overview": "From the book, \"Commodore 64 Games Book 2\". The objective of this game is to destroy the egg creature. He is protected by a moving fence with gaps in it and a shield. You must fire your missiles up at the creature through the fence and gradually eat the shield away. When there is a complete hole in the fence you can destroy the egg creature. Beware, he can drop bombs on you which can be avoided by moving the missile launcher from side to side with the I and P keys. The missile launcher only has a limited number of missiles, thirty, and a small amount of fuel with which to move itself. Each time that you eat a chunk out of the shield you get 20 points. Hitting the Egg Plant gives 100 points.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gregg Barnett", "publishers": "Melbourne House", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/98098-egg-plant\n"}
