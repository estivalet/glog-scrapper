{"altername_name": [], "name": "Baccaroo", "overview": "Rescue the ice load of a space freighter! Beware the planet Thiera from dying of thirst! The complicated security robots must not be underestimated! After the great interplanetary war, drinkable water has become rare. The population of Thiera will die of thirst shortly. The since long overdue arrival of the ice freighter \"Baccaroo\" is yearningly awaited. When contact is made with the gigantic spaceship, the crew does not answer. What might have happened? Was the ship hijacked by pirates and was the crew eliminated? Unfortunately, this suspicion is confirmed by a surveillance probe: Ice pirates were on the ship, and they have triggered the automatic security mechanism. This protection consists of 251 ice caring robots that are moving on the 35 decks of the freighter carrying their cold load. Each of these numbered robots carries an ice block inside it and explodes at unwarranted contact. To recover the load, a defusing manipulator is sent on its way and automatically docks at the space freighter. Due to safety reasons, the manipulator has to be remotely controlled from this point onward. You, as the best technician in the space fleet, take over this task!
