{"altername_name": [], "name": "Night Pilot 64", "overview": "This flight simulator program represents a light plane coming in to land from 3500 feet, hampered by total darkness. You'll need plenty of practice before you're able to control the plane. Try to level out at a fairly high altitude and start a gentle descent. Watch your altimeter, check your tilt, keep a steady hand on your speed and say a little prayer. Any landing you live past is a good ending.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "William Fong", "publishers": "Commodore Horizons Magazine", "genres": "Flight Simulator", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/101237-night-pilot-64\n"}
