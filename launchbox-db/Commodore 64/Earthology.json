{"altername_name": [], "name": "Earthology", "overview": "An Earth-Day type educational quiz published in Loadstar #102. Those zany Quirkons are back! This time they want to quiz you about our environment and its problems. This time there are 70 total statements in seven different categories. Each statement is either true or false, according to the knowledge of 1992. If you answer 20 questions correctly before you answer 10 wrong then you will have passed the Quirkon test and be eligible to join the Galactic Advanced Society. If you sense the quiz is going badly for you you can hit Q to quit early but that does show a certain lack of preparation on your part. Remember that good ecology is necessary to your planet's survival!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Henry Cochran", "publishers": "Softdisk Publishing", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/97947-earthology\n"}
