{"altername_name": [], "name": "Desert Duel", "overview": "A shooter created by John Augustine and released in 1988 in Loadstar #046. You are the turret gunner on a Rommel-rousing tank. Try to make general. Damn the Desert Fox! You and the rest of your troops thought you had seen the last of him after the skirmish at Tobruk but when that sirocco came out of the southern sands you lost the rest of your battalion. Now you're stuck somewhere in the Sahara with few provisions, except for an unlimited supply of shells for your turret gun. You wouldn't mind waiting out the rest of the war right here, but your sharp eyes spy something sneaking out of the Atlas Mountains. It's a column of tanks and you need to start lobbing out some shells to take them out right away! You start out as a sergeant. Your rank is shown by the insignia in the lower left hand corner. Every five tanks you destroy increases your rank one level. The rank sequence is: SERGEANT, STAFF SERGEANT, SERGEANT FIRST CLASS, MASTER SERGEANT, LIEUTENANT, CAPTAIN, MAJOR, COLONEL and GENERAL. The enemy will be shooting back. Each hit will cut down on your Mobility. If you suffer six hits, you'll be done for and the game will show you your score and ask if you want to try it again.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "John Augustine", "publishers": "Softdisk Publishing, Inc.", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/96425-desert-duel\n"}
