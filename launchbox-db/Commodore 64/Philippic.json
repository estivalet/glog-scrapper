{"altername_name": [], "name": "Philippic", "overview": "Philippic is a logical/brain/puzzle game created in Axel Teichmann and published in Magic Disk 64 1992/12. The playing field consists of four test tubes, each of which has three different colors. The aim of the game is to transfer the given color combination (lamps above the lower box) onto the lower color box by cleverly stacking them. With the joystick in port # 2 you control a drawer with two compartments, which logically also contains two colors. By pressing the fire button, the paint is sucked out of the compartments and placed on top of the corresponding pile. At the same time, the drawer fills up again with the colors from the bottom two compartments. That sounds more or less simple now, but it isn't! Between the top and bottom stones there are six other colored compartments that only become visible when you start your way down. As soon as the color of the lamps matches the colors of the lowest compartments, the level is over and 1000 bonus points are guaranteed.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "December 1, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Axel Teichmann", "publishers": "CP Verlag", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/124017-philippic\n"}
