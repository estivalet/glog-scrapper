{"altername_name": [], "name": "Logomix", "overview": "Logomix is a single-player logical game developed by Steffen Schlo\u00dfhauer. It was published in 64'er 1992/06. Think, consider and execute. That's roughly the motto of the game Logomix. It's about bringing the stones scattered on the left side back into shape, i.e. sorting them exactly as shown on the right half of the screen. It all sounds very simple, you might be thinking. However, you cannot move the stones around as you wish, you can only turn four of them clockwise at the same time. An additional limitation of the moves makes it even more difficult, because in some levels a certain order is important so that you don't run out of moves halfway. By the way, the controls are provided by a joystick in port 2. The stones can be rotated with the fire button.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "June 1, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Steffen Schlo\u00dfhauer", "publishers": "Markt & Technik", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/169692-logomix\n"}
