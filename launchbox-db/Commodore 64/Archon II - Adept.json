{"altername_name": [], "name": "Archon II: Adept", "overview": "The sequel to Archon, Archon II: Adept features a more complex board and enhanced gameplay. Each side plays as an Adept - a powerful wizard with the ability to cast spells against other Adepts and his summonings - and must defeat the other side, either Chaos or Order, by attacking him/her with summoned Elementals or Demons. Each side can summon 4 unique elementals at a time or choose from 4 demons, common to both. Gameplay is similar to the original, reminiscent of a chess-like board game, requiring strategy, but with arcade elements, especially when two adepts confront each other face-to-face. The board also shifts from time to time, making the strategy less predictable.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Free Fall Associates", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.54", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archon_II:_Adept", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDVOWlRhZwo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/87401-archon-ii-adept\n"}
