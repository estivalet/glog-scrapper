{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bozo's Night Out", "overview": "In this game, you have to try to get Bozo home safely with as many pints as he can drink. There are three different paths to take, the left path, the right path or through the park. Once you safely get him home, you get 5 pints, and you have to do this again the next night. As the game goes on, it gets harder for him to walk in a straight line. If he gets injured or captured by the police, he loses 1 to 5 pints.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "March 1, 1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Taskset", "publishers": "Argus Press Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bozo's_Night_Out", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PtRorgiWyo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90023-bozos-night-out\n"}
