{"altername_name": [], "name": "Abrasco Golf", "overview": "Golf allows you to play a round over 18 holes, on your own or against a friend with each player taking a shot after the other player has taken one. After entering your name and handicap, and choosing how many holes to play, you are shown a overhead view of the first hole. After selecting a club you then see your golfer from the side to select your direction of the shot. To choose a direction, you use the angles on a circle from 0 to 359 before selecting the power of the shot by moving the club on your golfer up or down. Once you are happy with your selections you watch the ball being hit and the screen scrolls from left to right following the ball. Once you get the ball on the green the view switches to a overhead shot of the green and you adjust the direction and power before watching the ball move towards the hole.
