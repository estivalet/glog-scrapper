{"altername_name": [], "name": "Team Patrol", "overview": "The object of the game is to put up a good race with two or four players. The Decathlon style gameplay takes place in splitscreen, but this time the players are Moon Patrol buggies rather than human runners! Waggling the joystick makes the buggy accelerate and the faster the movement the faster the vehicle goes. But it's not just joystick-shaking; there are also big ski-jumps, abysses and walls for the player to negotiate with skillful jumping and in places there are ground hazards like mud that can slow you down and spikes lurking that can puncture your tires, leading to disqualification. Your skill at avoiding these hazards is what can win or lose a race and your efforts will get rewarded by an entry into one of 32 saveable race time records. In the 2 versus 2 player game you will need the 4 Player Interface.
