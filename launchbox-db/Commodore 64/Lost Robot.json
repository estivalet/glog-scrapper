Lost in a strange world. Search the interplanetary outbacks lonely robot returning home. Control him. Find the way out for him. But watch out for attackers. An interesting experiment was on the agenda. Until now, the only way to traverse hyperspace was in space gliders. For the first time in human history, a new transmitter should make it possible to jump through the universe - without costly take-offs and landings, without time differences and without the long journey in a spaceship. One quick step through the dimensional gate of the transmitter - and the journey would be over. But before the first human beings were sent on their journey, this new achievement had to be tested. With a humanoid, a robot. Only his notes could provide information about the dangers of a dimensional journey. Today, February 20th, 4003, the time has come. The antennas of the transmitter are aimed at a planet in the constellation of Alpha Centaur. A 16LXY23 type robot is sent. The settings are only off by a millionth of a degree, but where did he end up and can he get home!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sven Forstmann", "publishers": "Markt & Technik", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsKLq00o0Tw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/121606-lost-robot\n"}
