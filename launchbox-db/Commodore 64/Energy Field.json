{"altername_name": [], "name": "Energy Field", "overview": "You are at the edge of Time, closely pursued by a fleet of alien craft who are out to steal your ship\u2019s power. However you have a trick or two up your sleeve. You have the capacity to guard the ends of the time tunnel by setting up energy fields at each of the four open ends of the system. If you attempt to set up a force field anywhere other than at the ends of the time tunnel, the force will feedback and destroy you. Likewise, if you set up a field at the end of an unoccupied tunnel you are finished. Passive cruiser commanders who allow too many aliens through will find their power drained and the game over.
