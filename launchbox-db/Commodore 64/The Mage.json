{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Mage", "overview": "Gaetano Chiummo won the 2010 Vertical scrolling SEUCK compo with this entry. In the land of Noworries, Teodius the Archmage was practicing his spells on nature. Unfortunately his practice made a huge impact on the untroubled land. Therefore, all good living creatures transformed into mutants. Teodius read the spell book to find out how to break the spell which he should not have done in the first place. The only way to break the spell was if another mage had turned the responsible person into a living amphibian (Okay, so it's a friendly green frog). Teodius was terrified and went into hiding. Meanwhile on the other side of the land of Noworries, lived another mage, called Durmion. After he heard a flash and bang, he found that all the nice living creatures and nature were really mean. So he heads off with his magic wand to find Teodius and break the spell. The game. Help Durmion transform mutants into nice living things again and seek out Teodius in his hideout. During your journey you can pick up the plants and mix them into the cauldron to gain better ability to fight your way to the end.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2011", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Chris Yates", "publishers": "The New Dimension (TND)", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/169155-the-mage\n"}
