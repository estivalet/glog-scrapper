{"altername_name": ["Waterkant Boulderdash 2"], "name": "Waterkant Dash 1", "overview": "The Boulder Dash Club Freudenberg was a club that was founded to swap Boulderdash games between Boulderdash fans. In that time Internet was not as important as it nowadays is, so a club like this one was pleasant for the Boulderdash players who had created own games or who wanted to play others' creations. Rolf Roth, the father of Marek Roth (who are both well-known people among the Boulderdash fans) sent all his games to the Boulder Dash Club Freudenberg. Once he won an award for the best title screens in his Boulderdash games and he got a lighter. This version translates to Waterfront and and there were a total of 8 games known in this series.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Peter Liepa", "publishers": "Boulder Dash Club Freudenberg", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/158582-waterkant-dash-1\n"}
