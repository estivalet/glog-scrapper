{"altername_name": [], "name": "Snake or Die", "overview": "With the fast snake you have to try to collect as many objects as possible that appear randomly and only for a short time somewhere on the screen. If you have reached the required number, you can try the next level. General: - You should avoid brushing against a building or the wall of the enclosure. The result is the loss of a life. - The same thing happens if you bite your own tail. So make sure to always leave enough space. - The snake grows the more objects it wraps around it. Do not be surprised! - You can accelerate the snake by pressing the fire button. Certain objects can still be reached in this way before they disappear without a trace. In the upper and lower corner of the screen there is a display that shows how many lives you can still gamble away and how many parts still have to be collected. In 2-player mode you can try yourself against a human teammate. The rules remain the same, but the playing field becomes much smaller.
