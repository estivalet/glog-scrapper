{"altername_name": [], "name": "Car Dodge (Richard Franklin)", "overview": "One of two games released by Duckworth Home Computing named Car Dodge, this one is by Richard Franklin and was released in the book, \"CBM 64 Programs - Volume 1\" Car is a racing game on a track the shape of which looks similar to a rifle, thus incorporating the required bends to make the game interesting. Car differs from the usual racing game because it requires as near as possible the actual driving skills one would learn in a 'real car'. The player must use his judgement when accelerating and changing through the gears. The driving novice is almost guaranteed to stall or over rev the engine causing a blow out.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Richard Franklin", "publishers": "Duckworth Home Computing", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/170119-car-dodge-richard-franklin\n"}
