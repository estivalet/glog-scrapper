{"altername_name": [], "name": "Builder Ben", "overview": "Builder Ben is a single screen game split into two parts where you play the role of Ben as you attempt to build four houses while avoiding various creatures and tools. In the first part you have to climb a brick wall from the bottom of the screen to retrieve your three tools at the top of the screen. As you climb the wall there are a weight and a bug that move around the screen, as well as a person who moves across the screen dropping a boulder when you are in line with him. Once you reach the top of the wall you receive one of the tools and you have to take back to the bottom of the screen all within a time limit. If you are touched or run out of time then you lose one of six lives. Once all the tools are taken to the bottom of the screen then it is on to the second part. The second part is a platform game based on the arcade game Burger Time where you have to build the four houses while avoiding two tools moving around the screen. The screen has four levels of platforms with ladders connecting and on each level is part of the house and you have to run over a part to move it down a level which pushes any other parts below to the bottom of the screen. If you touch a tool then you lose a life and the screen is completed when all four houses are complete.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Don Rigby", "publishers": "Scorpio Gamesworld", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90199-builder-ben\n"}
