{"altername_name": ["Casse"], "name": "Sliding Skill", "overview": "A good Sokoban type puzzle-logic game with some funky music. The levels appear in a random order and are sometimes repeated. Show off your sliding skill by helping a warehouse worker sort out a huge amount of colorful crates. Your task is very simple: you have to move the various crates in the warehouse room and match all the crates of the same color. Once you have placed your order, you can access the next room in the warehouse to complete a new, difficult task. As you progress through the game you will also have suction cups at your disposal that will be useful for moving some crates that would otherwise be impossible to push. To move a crate using the suction cup you will have to approach the crate, press the button and give the crate a direction. Remember that your time to finish the work is limited, so don't waste your precious time!
