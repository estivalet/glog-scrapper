The game is a horizontal shooter viewed from above with the screen scrolling to the left or the right when you move. You must blast any alien craft you encounter while avoiding them or their weapons and if you are hit then you lose one of three lives. Touching any of the scenery or buildings also loses a life. Each level is made up of sections surrounding a dimension duct and you must fly over every section to open up the duct. A small map of the sections is shown on the bottom right and when every section is green then the duct will open. You then play a bonus game where you on on the left of the screen and alien crafts fly from the right. You can only move up or down to avoid or shoot the craft and the aim is to last 30 seconds before moving to the next level.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Steve Lee", "publishers": "Virgin Games", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYec03PVQpQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/89212-erebus\n"}
