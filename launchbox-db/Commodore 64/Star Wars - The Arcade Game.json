{"altername_name": [], "name": "Star Wars: The Arcade Game", "overview": "Visually very similar to the Domark/Tengen/Br\u00f8derbund version, the Parker Brothers cartridge release is considered distinct, though it features much the same game elements. Star Wars is a first-person rail shooter and attempts to recreate the color vector graphics of the Atari arcade games. Assuming the role of Luke Skywalker (\"Red Five\"), the player pilots an X-wing fighter from a first-person perspective. The player does not have to destroy every TIE Fighter and gun turret in order to advance through the game; instead, the player must survive for a set length of time, either avoiding or destroying enemies and the shots they fire. The player begins with six shields, one of which is lost for every collision with an enemy or projectile. If the player loses all shields and is hit again, the game ends. Each wave of the game consists of three attack phases, culminating in the destruction of the Death Star.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Michael Greene", "publishers": "Parker Brothers", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vi0RzmfbgSs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/123226-star-wars-the-arcade-game\n"}
