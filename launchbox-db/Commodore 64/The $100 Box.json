{"altername_name": ["$100 Box"], "name": "The $100 Box", "overview": "This one is based on a mathematics game theory problem for 100 people, but the game simulates the problem with just one player. The computer selects a random number from 1 to 100 as your lucky number. You will need to guess which box from 00-99 where the lucky number is hidden. The game allows you to have up to 50 guesses, but it's not easy to win as it sounds!
