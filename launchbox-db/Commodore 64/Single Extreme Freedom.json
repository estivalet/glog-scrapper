In the game itself, the screen is divided into portions, which can be scrolled from right to left \u2013 the map; the hot spots of the events mentioned above are also bearing the name of their fictitious cities and ports. Between these lands, the players can move troops and ammunition, which can be traded, or navigate ships in the coastal area between. Throughout the game, there are various distractions which sometimes require the player to read a newspaper, or to bear children during that time. One aspect is that if you don\u2019t have a child and if a king dies without an heir, then the game is over. There are three different periods in the kingdom\u2019s history and each has its own text handler, players can also choose the destination at the beginning of the game and other conditions.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tam\u00e1s Tarn\u00f3czky", "publishers": "Alice Software Studio", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/127536-single-extreme-freedom\n"}
