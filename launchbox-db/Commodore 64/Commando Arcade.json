{"altername_name": [], "name": "Commando Arcade", "overview": "Nostalgia did something that no one else tried to do before - we improved one of the best games on C64 - COMMANDO. We added new levels (5 to be exact), we added new Animations, we actually re-coded a lot of the game to make it glitch-free, added new Sound options and tunes and we bug fixed the rest. This is now THE best home computer version of the game. Some would even say it is THE best version of the game PERIOD.
