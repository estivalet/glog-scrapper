{"altername_name": ["Tom Pinone's Poker", "Poker", "Saloon Poker"], "name": "Poker (Duckworth)", "overview": "Poker is a computerised version of the card game played with five cards and with $1000 you must try to beat six computer opponents set in a wild west smoky saloon bar. Your opponents are Matt Dillon, Black Jake, The Mayor, Billy the Kid, Joshua Smith and Doc Holliday with Moll the Barmaid stood behind you ready to give advice if needed. Once the cards have been dealt then the first bet is $1 and any bets raised double the last bet. After the bets have been placed and any opponent has dropped out including yourself, you can then discard up to three cards to try to improve your hand if still in the game. Once cards have been sorted then the betting starts again until everyone is happy with their choices and the result of the hands are shown. A new hand is dealt and the game continues until you take all your opponents money or you lose all yours.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tom Pinone", "publishers": "Duckworth Home Computing", "genres": "Casino", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/121732-poker-duckworth\n"}
