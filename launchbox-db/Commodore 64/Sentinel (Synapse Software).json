{"altername_name": ["Fire Storm"], "name": "Sentinel (Synapse Software)", "overview": "In this sequel to Dimension X, you join the warriors of Dimension X to continue fight against evil on the planet Jaraloba. This time it is flown in outer space, while you are controlling the space jet. Gorganitor squadrons were detected in all 50 sectors (10x5 matrix) of your star cluster, and you should clear them one-by-one. Sitting in cockpit of your space jet, you may examine the view in first-person perspective, accelerate, decelerate your jet, move in 360 degrees, and shoot the enemy spacecrafts. During your mission, radar helps you to detect the enemies out of your view, but energy is exhausting, time is flowing, and shields are decreasing with enemy shots.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bryan Brandenburg", "publishers": "Americana Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/Isxj8nyMKmE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/85924-sentinel-synapse-software\n"}
