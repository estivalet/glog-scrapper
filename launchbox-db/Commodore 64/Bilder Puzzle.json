{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bilder Puzzle", "overview": "The picture puzzle is played alternately by two players. The aim is to uncover the identical images among the 18 hidden images. The player who found the most pairs of images is the winner. The game is played with the joystick. The desired picture is selected via the marking on the screen and then revealed via the trigger button. Now the second picture is controlled and also uncovered. If the two pictures match, you score points and you can immediately try your luck again. Otherwise it's the opponent's turn. Matching pictures remain uncovered - they are now of no importance for the further course of the game. Who has the best memory? Because that's the only way to win picture puzzles. Have fun and a very special tip: how about playing against the clock as well?", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Europa Computer-Club", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/110150-bilder-puzzle\n"}
