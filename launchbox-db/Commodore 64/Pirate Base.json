{"altername_name": ["Pirate Base 3", "Base 3"], "name": "Pirate Base", "overview": "Base 3 is the name of a space station located just outside the Earth's Orbit. Set up many moons ago in the year 2091, its primary purpose is, essentially, to act as a sort of intergalactic Customs shed and immigration checkpoint where all visiting spacecraft must dock to have its crew and cargo screened before progressing to Earth. As such, Base 3 also occupies a position of vital strategic importance: should it fall into the wrong hands, and particularly those of the dreaded super-alien, Lee, the planet Earth would be in serious jeopardy! But what has this to do with the present, you might well ask? Surely it could never come to that? Well, as in all the best games, the worst DOES happen and yes the evil Lee, with many ships and droid armies as his disposal, HAS invaded and captured Base 3 - in fact, he's made himself very comfortable indeed, thank you very much, and feels so settled that he's even built his own fortress there and renamed it Pirate Base 3 in his own honour! You and a chum must battle to save Base 3 from Lee: you must penetrate his defences, wipe out his fortress, and eventually confront Lee himself.
