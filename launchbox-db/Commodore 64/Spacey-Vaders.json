{"altername_name": [], "name": "Spacey-Vaders", "overview": "Very much like Invadagame, this was a game that could load into memory while the actual game you purchased was loading. Since game loading on the C64, especially for those using cassette tape based games, was extremely slow. This gave you something fun to do while your purchased game prepared to be played. Gamebase has this as unpublished, but it was definitely published just not as it's own game. Always a bridesmaid, never the bride. The differences between this and Invadagame are small and mostly cosmetic but are there, nonetheless.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dave Korn", "publishers": "", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/129392-spacey-vaders\n"}
