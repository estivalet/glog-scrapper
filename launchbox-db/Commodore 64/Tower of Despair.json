{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tower of Despair", "overview": "Malmor, the Demonlord of Darkness has attempted to overthrow the land of Aelandor many times from the Tower of Despair but many times he has been defeated. In his last defeat, Malmor was sent to the Planes of Limbo by the Council of Wizards thus the believe this was the last time he would rise. But alas no, Malmor has found the artifact, The Ring of Skulls and escaped Limbo and returned to his tower. To make matters worse he has summoned a Hellgaunt to be his servant. This will surely be the last the people of Aelandor can fight and defeat the Demonlord of Darkness.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jamie Thomson", "publishers": "Games Workshop", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Despair", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3K0IJaCA7A", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/110094-tower-of-despair\n"}
