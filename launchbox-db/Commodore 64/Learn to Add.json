{"altername_name": [], "name": "Learn to Add", "overview": "Learn to Add is an educational game designed for children ages 3-7. The object of the game is to complete a rainbow by solving number problems. On each turn, you first select a number from 1 to 9. The computer will then present a problem involving that number along with several groups of balloons of varying quantities. You then need to guide an animal over to the group of balloons which has the same number of balloons as the number that would solve the problem. On easier skill levels, you just need to select the group of balloons that matches the number selected. Tougher skill levels present addition problems where you need to fill in the blank. Each time you answer correctly, part of a rainbow appears on the screen. Complete the rainbow, and you win!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "ChildWare", "publishers": "Spinnaker Software", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109485-learn-to-add\n"}
