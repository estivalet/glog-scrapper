{"altername_name": [], "name": "Zorg", "overview": "Zorg is a keyboard only (it's single button, so just the space bar) French language Blitz clone (only instead of a traditional airplane, you play an alien in a UFO) for the Commodore 64. It was developed by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric M\u00e9line and published in Hebdogiciel N\u00b0004 (04.11.1983). This was coded entirely in BASIC. There is no title screen, and when the game is over, it exits the program but shows the text \"Fiin de Jeu\" which is French for End of Play. You can play the game again by typing in run and hitting the enter key.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric M\u00e9line", "publishers": "Hebdogiciel", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/156492-zorg\n"}
