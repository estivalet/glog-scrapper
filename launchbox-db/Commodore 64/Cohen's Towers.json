One of the most important jobs in the corporate structure, my boy. The mail must be delivered! If you do a good job (and don't play around with my secretary, Arlene) you may get promoted to my two other buildings. One Word of warning. my cousin-in-law, Bobby, has been known to steal the mail. We jokingly refer to him as the \"Corporate Spy.\" If he wasn't related to my wife, I would have fired him long ago - but he's harmless. Just be on the watch and catch him before he gets away with the mail! Good luck, Allen. I know you can handle the job! D.G. The Boss P.S. My dog, Fear, might get in your way once in a while.
