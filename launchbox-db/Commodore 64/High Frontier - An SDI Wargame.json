{"altername_name": ["High Frontier"], "name": "High Frontier: An SDI Wargame", "overview": "When High Frontier was created, America was investing heavily in the original 'Star Wars' SDI, to fend off a feared Soviet missile attack. Your job in this strategy game is to oversee its development. The game is played via an icon control system, with a common set of icons and information panels are displayed around these screens. There are six distinct screens used to make the decisions, plus the ability to track existing satellites and keep track of active Soviet attacks. The Research & Development screen is the first port of call. It is split into six components, to which you must assign money and staff. The President will give the order to arm or disarm your units (including the activation code). Once you have working SDIs and the permission codes, you can launch them using the Shield screen. Espionage and Reconnaissance cameras are located to keep track of enemy development, although these figures are not always precise. The Threats screen lets you keep track of enemy resources and moods. The World screen effectively moves the game forward in time.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Software Studios", "publishers": "Activision (UK)", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntrzSuiw_N4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/104497-high-frontier-an-sdi-wargame\n"}
