{"altername_name": [], "name": "Soccer Rivals", "overview": "Soccer Rivals is a football management game in the style of a board game where you play against 2 other players (human or computer) and try to take your team from Division 4 to Division 1 and win the title. There are 32 teams to choose from and you have the choice of five skill levels. The actual game has the whole board going round the edge of the screen. The board is made up of various amounts of eight icons which when landed on allow you to buy and sell players, train players, adjust utilities like capacity, surveillance cameras and youth team. Other icons have random choices which have bad or good effects of your finances and team. The last icon is a small arcade sequence where you press S to kick a ball at a moving target, hit the target and you win money. In the middle of the board is your team and you can adjust the formation and select the players. Once everyone has had one move and are happy with their team selections then you play a match, which just involves seeing the match results. Each player has another move round the board and onto the next match..", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Richard #2", "publishers": "Cult Games", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "3", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jTr_GGOZWo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109666-soccer-rivals\n"}
