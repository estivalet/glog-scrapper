{"altername_name": ["Traz II", "Trap 2"], "name": "Traz 2", "overview": "In the rush to be the first one to use the level-editor to create an unofficial sequel to Traz, this one came in slightly behind, but with some really nice quality levels to play. Transformable Arcade Zone is a Breakout clone with multiple paddles, 64 levels and a built-in level construction set. Each level can have different set of paddles, sometimes one at the top and one at the bottom, sometimes one left one right, sometimes four stacked-up etc. This gives each level a distinctly new gameplay. There are unbreakable blocks, monster generators (also unbreakable) and glass refractors that change the balls movement angle as it passes through. After a level is cleared, the player must choose the next level by moving on a 8x8 grid of levels.
