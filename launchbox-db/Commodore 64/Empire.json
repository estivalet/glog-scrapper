{"altername_name": [], "name": "Empire", "overview": "Empire is a strategy game inspired by the board game Risk where you must compete against the computer for world domination with nine skill levels. You are first presented with a map of the world with various white squares as well as some yellow neutral squares and you and the computer take it in turns to choose a white square as your territory. Once you have both chosen your territories you can then allocate an extra 26 armies with up to nine added to a territory. You and the computer now take it in turns to attack either the other players army or a neutral territory by selecting the territory they want to attack. Once the result is known and who ever wins the battle can then decide how many armies to place in the new territory. The game progresses until one player has captured all territories.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Shards Software", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/98450-empire\n"}
