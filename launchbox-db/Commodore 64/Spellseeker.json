{"altername_name": [], "name": "Spellseeker", "overview": "You are a wizard who has volunteered to search the Magic Maze for the evil sorcerer Ashlaa and kill him. The maze is full of dangerous monsters who will try to kill you by decreasing your damage and when it reaches zero it is game over. You are able to use various types of magic which can be collected along the way as well as a shield. Scattered around the maze are various types of wells which can increase your damage and magic but some are poisonous. Teleports can also be discovered which will transport you to other parts of the maze. The game is an isometric flick-screen maze arcade adventure where a joystick is used to control your hero while the keyboard finds and selects spells in a small menu which also allows you to unlock items and escape. As well as the main playing area and menu you can see your damage, magic and spell meters, a clock and which monster you are fighting.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "D.J.
