{"altername_name": [], "name": "Double or Quits", "overview": "This solitaire game by Maurice Jones and published in 1990 in Loadstar #078 is played by dealing one card to each of the 8 piles, with the 8th pile the foundation to which all cards except the kings are to be played. The other seven cards are the tableau and each is available for play to the foundation at any time. The remaining cards form the deck, which is turned one at a time to the waste pile. Any card played from the seven tableau piles is immediately replaced by the top card of the Haste pile, or if there are no cards in the waste pile, by the top card from the deck. The foundation is built in a doubling sequence as follows: A,2,4,8,3,6,Q,J,9,5,10,7,A,... The value of each card is doubled and if the value exceeds thirteen, thirteen is subtracted to obtain the value of the next. Jacks count 11, queens 12, aces 1. For example, if the top card is a three, the next card will be a six and the one after that a queen. Since kings never appear in the sequence, they are dead cards, and once played to the tableau will remain there. The game is won only if all cards other than the kings are played to the single foundation pile. The game is listed in THE COMPLETE BOOK OF SOLITAIRE & PATIENCE GAMES by Morehead and Mott-Smith. The chances of winning are given as one in three with two redeals allowed.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Maurice Jones", "publishers": "Softdisk Publishing, Inc.", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/97374-double-or-quits\n"}
