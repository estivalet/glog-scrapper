{"altername_name": [], "name": "Swoop (Micro Power)", "overview": "In this Galaxian style shoot 'em up, you are at the controls of a laser base, trying to rid the space lanes of the homing, swooping Birdment. There are 3 types of Birdmen. The Blue Hawks are the most prolific and move relatively slowly, Green Merlins swoop at twice the vertical speed, and the Red Condors are the most deadly, moving twice as fast both vertically and horizontally. If a Birdman gets past you, he will lay an explosive egg on your laser base track, thus restricting your movements. However, these eggs disintegrate after 5 seconds. Watch out for falling debris from destroyed Birdmen.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "David Elliot", "publishers": "Micro Power", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swoop_(1982_video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23dJbXTmu7k", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113577-swoop-micro-power\n"}
