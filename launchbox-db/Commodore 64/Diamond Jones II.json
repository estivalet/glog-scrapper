{"altername_name": [], "name": "Diamond Jones II", "overview": "A Boulder Dash style game created by Jan Zimmermann and released in 64'er 1993/11, 64'er 1999/01, it is a sequel to the original Diamond Jones. Our specialist for complex graphics applications in just two silly kilobytes has struck again: Jen Zimmermann has programmed a worthy successor to the first game installment. Again, the Boulder Dash Clone is about collecting the scattered diamonds in various caves. A total of nine caves are waiting for the adventurer. Unfortunately, there are more guards than diamonds in some individual sections: brains and a lot of joystick acrobatics are required. If you practice a little, you will come up with a number of tricks on how to play the guards the easiest way. For this you have to know, for example, that the guards always move straight ahead until they meet an obstacle, then they turn 90\u00b0 and continue running to the next obstacle. To make everything even more difficult another factor must be remembered, the player only has a full 45 seconds to collect all the diamonds until the cave thunders down in a furious avalanche.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "November 1, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jan Zimmermann", "publishers": "Markt & Technik", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/96502-diamond-jones-ii\n"}
