{"altername_name": [], "name": "Chicken", "overview": "The deadly game of Chicken, played for decades by rival macho speed freaks with ego problems, now you too can go head-to-head in a bout of truck smashing - but without the after effects! In order to be able to smash into your opponent you must first increase the crunch power, which is done by collecting the steel girders that appear. Whoever collected the last girder his/her car colour will be displayed in the bottom border, showing who has the most crunch power and the ability to smash the other truck. Various extras can be collected to increase your smashing ability, shields will protect you from your opponent, turbo power to increase your speed, flame weapons to totally wipe your opponent out, and an assortment of other accessories and road hazards.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "John D.
