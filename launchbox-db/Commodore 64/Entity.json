{"altername_name": [], "name": "Entity", "overview": "Entity recreates a solitaire puzzle game originating in Victorian England. Played on a grid of 17 squares, arranged as a pair of overlapping 3x3 diamonds. There are 8 white tiles and 8 black tiles, with a single space at all times. At the start, the space separates the white tiles on the left from the black tiles on the right - the player's objective is to move the tiles so as to reverse this, leaving the black tiles on the left and the white tiles on the right. Tiles can be moved one space into the gap, or can jump directly over a tile to land in the gap. However, they must be at a right-angle to the space, not on an opposite corner. The all-time record is 46 moves; a simulation of this game is included on the disk.
