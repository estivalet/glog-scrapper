{"altername_name": [], "name": "Patience (CP Verlag)", "overview": "A solitaire variant published in Magic Disk 64 1989/12. Patience games typically involve dealing cards from a shuffled deck into a prescribed arrangement on a tabletop, from which the player attempts to reorder the deck by suit and rank through a series of moves transferring cards from one place to another under prescribed restrictions. Some games allow for the reshuffling of the decks, or the placement of cards into new or \"empty\" locations. In the most familiar, general form of patience, the object of the game is to build up four blocks of cards going from ace to king in each suit, taking cards from the layout if they appear on the table.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "December 4, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gerald Borchert", "publishers": "CP Verlag", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/123912-patience-cp-verlag\n"}
