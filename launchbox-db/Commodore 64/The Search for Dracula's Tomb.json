{"altername_name": ["Search for Dracula's Tomb"], "name": "The Search for Dracula's Tomb", "overview": "You are a famous vampire hunter from the old world. You have been given the task of finding and killing the King of the Vampires, Count Dracula! You must search through the country side, killing werewolves, skeletons, and ghouls until you find Dracula. You will need to collect weapons in your search that are able to kill Dracula. You will find guns, silver bullets, garlic, and other items to help you kill him. Every time you fight a Monster, you will lose some energy. To restore your strength you will need to return to your home (the castle in the upper left corner of the map). If your energy level reaches zero, you will die!
