{"altername_name": [], "name": "Nightmare Park", "overview": "Nightmare Park is a top down single screen game where you have to enter a park from the top of the screen and get to the exit at the bottom of the screen through a simple maze. You can move in a 90 degree direction, and as you go through the maze you will come across a random mini-game. These games are simple single screen games and these include avoiding rampaging rhinos, guess the name of a gorilla and get into a safe position from lasers. If you complete a game then you carry on through the park but if you fail then it is game over.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "A.R.
