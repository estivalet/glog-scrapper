{"altername_name": [], "name": "Eggman", "overview": "In this 1992 puzzler from MIchal Bacik you must get three yellow eggs in a row either vertically or horizontally. After every few successes you will get a code to let you restart later. If you push the eggs they will travel until they touch another object, plan things out or it can get dicey. Pushing stones can also crush monsters. You can destroy other color eggs by pushing two together. Don't crack, there is a way to accomplish all things!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Michal Bac\u00edk", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46oBv4aRxs8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/98075-eggman\n"}
