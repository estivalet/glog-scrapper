{"altername_name": ["Dizzy: The Ultimate Cartoon Adventure"], "name": "Dizzy", "overview": "The game is a platform adventure where Dizzy must search the fairy tale land of Katmandu for a Leprechaun's Wig, a Cloud's Silver Lining, a Vampire Dux Feather, and a Troll Brew and deposit them in a cauldron to make a potion to defeat the evil wizard Zaks. The gameplay involves collecting items and moving to other locations where the item is required; for example, at one point a raincoat is needed to protect against damaging rain. This is made more difficult because only one item can be carried at any given time. Unlike later games in the series, which focus more on the inventory-based puzzles, this game features a very large number of hazards that kill the player on contact. With only three lives initially to complete the game, this makes it a very difficult game to complete by today's standards.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "September 1, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Codemasters", "publishers": "Codemasters", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.55", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gSf_7OHS90", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/33146-dizzy\n"}
