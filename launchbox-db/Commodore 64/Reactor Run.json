{"altername_name": ["Android Chase"], "name": "Reactor Run", "overview": "The year 2990 has come. The X time taken. Everything seemed to go smoothly in the small town of Barninghum where almost all the industrious inhabitants are employed in the nearby nuclear station. But suddenly a technician notices that the safe alarm systems indicate an overheating of the cooling system. Something has gone wrong! The evacuation plan is immediately implemented. Once everyone is out, the security system bars the doors, but at this point Dr. Jennings realizes that his secretary has not gone out with everyone else. After a quick review it is established with certainty that she must be locked inside the dangerous building. You must find the necessary keys that will be used to open the various doors of the office complex and then air vehicles to reach the area where the girl must be hidden. Or work to reach the reactor room and restore the upset order. Published in Italy as Android Chase in both Hit Parade C64 n.18 (Dicembre 1987) and in I Magnifici 5 & 7 n.24 (maggio 1987).", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Fabian Rosenschein", "publishers": "Edizioni Societ\u00e0 SIPE", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekaiMJVsWPY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/125601-reactor-run\n"}
