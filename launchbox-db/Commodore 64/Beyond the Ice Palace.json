{"altername_name": [], "name": "Beyond the Ice Palace", "overview": "This platform romp has similarities to Ghosts 'N Goblins, sending you on a journey to defeat the forces of evil. You start the game with nine lives, and you'll need them although there are only 3 (large) levels, each finishing with a boss. All manner of monsters block your path and must be attacked with your horizontally-travelling daggers. Additional weapons can be collected, as can bonus orbs, and the chance to summon a spirit to attack for you on the toughest sections.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Elite Systems", "publishers": "EDOS", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.42", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyond_the_Ice_Palace", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6491-beyond-the-ice-palace\n"}
