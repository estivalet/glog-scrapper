{"altername_name": ["Surfer Videogame"], "name": "Surfer", "overview": "Driving down the face you crank into your bottom turn, maneuver your way around surfers paddling out, aware all the time of the lip that could nail you as surely as a glass axe. If you climb too high, you'll be pitched out or sucked over the falls. So you cutback hard and set up for the tube. See how deep you can ride before the barrel swallows you up. Blast off the lip! Hang Ten! Throw in a radical 360, or drive up the face to pull off an incredible aerial! The closest thing there is to surfing without getting wet. You score points according to the same formulas used in real-life amateur and professional surfing events. Play against your friends and have a surf contest in your own living room!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jeff Maier", "publishers": "Surfer Magazine", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/169853-surfer\n"}
