{"altername_name": [], "name": "Frustration", "overview": "A logic puzzle game like an expanded version of Mastermind with more colors to guess. It was created by Joseph F. Galen and published by Bahamaware in 1986. Frustration is easy to play, but hard to score well. It takes a logical mind and the ability to interpret feedback and make decisions rapidly under severe time pressure. That's why it is a lot of fun. Enter a 1 for amount of teams and the number of games you want to play. Then choose your starting level. You must guess the five character code and you must match it exactly in the given time limit. The faster you find the code, the more points you will get. The possible characters are ROYGBTPW* and characters may repeat. Enter your first guess and hit return. You will get a blue circle if you have the right code in the right place, a yellow one if you have the right code in the wrong location and a blank where you do not have a match. Blue will always be first, it does NOT indicate the position you have matched, just that one character is in the right place and color. Modify your feedback until you have all blue circles and you will be scored!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Joseph F.
