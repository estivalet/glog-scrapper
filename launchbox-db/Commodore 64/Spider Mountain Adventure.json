{"altername_name": [], "name": "Spider Mountain Adventure", "overview": "In substance the majority of this game was written in 1979 and published for TRS80 late in that year and early in 1980 but did not get published for the Commodore 64 until 1982. This is a fantasy themed reworking by Programmer's Guild founder Bob Liddil and \"Teri Li\" (actually Terry Kepner, who was contracted to another company at the time and programmed under a pseudonym here.) of The Lost Dutchman's Gold. We begin at our small campsite, where we see some carrysacks, an untied burdenbeast, and a campfire. Clearly there's a fantasy motif afoot here, and the game adopts some unusual object names in an effort to distance its universe from the real world. LOOK BEAST yields nothing interesting, and look beast even less due to the parser's case-sensitivity, but LOOK BURDENBEAST reveals the creature as a FLOP-EARED ILL TEMPERED QUADRAPED [sic]. It's very like a mule, in other words; this is starting out a lot like Lost Dutchman's Gold. This game is worth playing for the history of the game itself alone as it is one of the very earliest of the breed. You are a knight on a quest to retrieve the treasures hidden deep in the caves of Spider Mountain. Grab your dart shooter and load up your burden-beast, adventure calls!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bob Liddel", "publishers": "Rider Fantasy Creations", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/76090-spider-mountain-adventure\n"}
