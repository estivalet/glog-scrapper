{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Mad Scientist", "overview": "A recent recovery in 2021 and lost for well over 30 years, The Mad Scientist was sent to several major software houses at the time in the 80\u2019s, such as Kele Line \u2013 who seemed most likely to publish. Unfortunately, when Kele Line went bankrupt, the game disappeared with them. Thanks to the graphics artist Jens Christian Thomsen, the game was preserved from an old tape and released via CSDB. The game itself is a neat split screen helicopter game, which feels a heck of a lot like Elite\u2019s Airwolf, and surely must have been inspired by it. We hope to learn more about the title from the team in the future, but for now, check out the game for yourself and see a title that could have been a lot of fun with two players. Though of course with as much hair pulling as with Elite\u2019s Airwolf!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "", "developers": "Carsten Rhod Gregersen", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ehpm8uzgpI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/160035-the-mad-scientist\n"}
