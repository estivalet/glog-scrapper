{"altername_name": [], "name": "Quattro Cartoon", "overview": "Quattro Cartoon is a compilation of four games which were all originally published under Codemasters' Cartoon Time label, and have particularly direct appeal to younger players: Frankenstein Jr.: Players take control of the son of Frankenstein's monster, and are tasked with the objective to rebuild his dad. Franky Jr. needs to search the castle for his father's body parts so that they can be rejoined back together. Little Puff In Dragon Land: Puff is a poor little dragon who decides to explore the world beyond his home - Dragonland. Unfortunately, he is now lost and wants to go back home! Puff is too little to do this adventure by himself so you have to guide him through many levels, solving puzzles, avoiding traps and find all four parts of the pass to get back into Dragonland. Olli & Lissa 3: This is the third game starring the doggie duo, and it features Olli's attempt to retrieve the parts for his car which have been stolen and scattered all over the Spooky Castle. Finding these and reassembling the car is done in several stages. First you must find a magnifying glass, and use this to examine the screens thoroughly to find each part. Wizard Willy: The titular wizard has to rescue a princess named Fifi from a dark fortress where she is held captive by an evil emperor. The only way to reach the fortress is by collecting ten magic eyes scattered across four levels, and defeating the demonic guardians who will try to impede Willy's progress.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Codemasters", "publishers": "Codemasters", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109613-quattro-cartoon\n"}
