{"altername_name": [], "name": "Chicken Catcher", "overview": "An arcade platformer of the most basic type, created by Steven R. McCloskey and published first in COMPUTE!'s Gazette 1985/11 (Issue #29) and then later as part of the Street Games published \"Red Pack\" in Australia and New Zealand. Children will enjoy netting the chicken in this action game for the 64, VIC, Plus/4, and C16. You're equipped with a net and a pair of good, strong legs. And you'll need them in \"Chicken Catcher.\" The object of the game is to catch a falling chicken in your net by timing your jump as you leap from one platform to another. The more chickens caught, the more points you collect. Fowl Play, for sure!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "November 4, 1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Steven R. McCloskey", "publishers": "COMPUTE!
