{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hungry Horace", "overview": "This was one of the Spectrum\u2019s earliest Pac-Man-influenced games, taking place on a quick succession of small levels. The level designs have a lot of complex corridors and side-lines, as well as at least one wrap-around section and one tunnel \u2013 the ghosts may well be waiting for you at the end of this. Each level features one power-pill to put to use, and an increasing number of enemies as you progress. Unlike most games of the style, after collecting all the dots you must progress through an exit at the right of the screen, so it might be worth planning your path through the dots so as to finish near this.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Psion Software Ltd.", "publishers": "Melbourne House", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungry_Horace", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbXVEISpIck", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/105360-hungry-horace\n"}
