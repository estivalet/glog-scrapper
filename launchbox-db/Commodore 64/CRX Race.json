{"altername_name": [], "name": "CRX Race", "overview": "Back in the 1980s, when not all cars looked the same, Japanese automaker Honda made a name for itself with the CRX model, a sleek coupe with a lot of bang under the hood. In this racing game called \" CRX Race \" you drive that cult car through a total of three different levels . In general, it is important to avoid collisions, from level 2 time and speed also play a role. Level 1 is a bird's eye view of the track, Level 2 is a side view and Level 3 is a rear view of the CRX. Only those who master the last stretch to the finish have made it through the game. You can only have 10 collisions with the edge of the road per level before the vehicle gives up the ghost, which can be read on the damage bar . From level 2 you also have to keep an eye on the time counter and possibly step on the gas. The finish bar shows how far away the target is. A CRX can only be bought twice per game, which corresponds to the usual three \"lives\".", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2016", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Simon Green", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Vehicle Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCMeTeA8T6k", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/244883-crx-race\n"}
