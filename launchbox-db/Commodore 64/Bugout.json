{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bugout", "overview": "Guide Smilin' Stan the exterminator, against an endless swarm of giant insects. Shoot insects without touching them or letting them escape. Rinse. Repeat. Bugout is a fast-paced arcade style game in which you guide our hero, Smilin Stan the exterminator, against an endless swarm of giant insects. The game begins with Stan's entrance from the left side of the screen, armed with a can of the strongest insecticide known to man. Use a joystick plugged into Port 2 to move Stan up and down the screen, and press the fire button to spray a stream of repellent at any bug that gets within range. All the bugs run away from you at different speeds. Bumping into an insect from behind causes it to run faster for a few moments. Since you can't move vertically when using the spray can, you can use this technique to keep the bugs out in front of you. This applies to all the insects except bees. Since the bees aren't as easily intimidated, they tend to fly toward you instead of away. And any contact with a bee results in a sting which paralyzes you for a few moments, giving the other bugs a chance to slip by. At the bottom of the screen you will find the score, the number of bugs missed, and the high score for the current session. Scoring begins at 10 points for each bug, but increases as the game speeds up. You can use the SHIFT-LOCK key to freeze the action. The game ends once three bugs are missed.
