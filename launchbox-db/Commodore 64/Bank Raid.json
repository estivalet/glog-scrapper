{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bank Raid", "overview": "Bankersville was a quiet town until each of its banks received a thousand bars of gold and the crime media found out. Now, the town is full of robbers, who in turn are robbing each of the banks. You have been employed by the town to shoot the robbers at each bank as they appear at the bank's windows in its vaults. However, you only have the time it takes them to put 10 gold bars into their bags. If you do not shoot them by then, they empty the gold into their truck at the rear of the bank and come back for more. If they steal all 1000 gold bars from the bank, they make off with the gold and you're fired. If you shoot the robbers before tehy steal all the gold you will get a reward. The amount depends on how much the lorry driver did not get away with.
