This park is very different from the ones people used to visit back in the 1990s. There are no \"tame\" rides in this park; instead you are thrown into \"real-life\" acts and situations where you have to use your wits and your intelligence to survive the \"day out\".

Hidden in each section is a \"special\" object. When you have found them all just take them to the main entrance and you will to allowed to go home.

So prepare yourself for the \"day out\" of a lifetime and let's hope you live to tell the tale ....", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jack A.
