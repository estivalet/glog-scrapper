You score points by winning a hand, which happens when you're the first to play all your cards or when your opponent's hand grows to 18 or more cards. The Duo deck contains 100 cards, eight each of cards 0-9, Skip a Turn and Draw 2 Cards, plus four Wild cards. All bu the Wild cards belong to either the red, blue, green or yellow suit. You determine a Wild's color when it is played. Each player starts each hand with six cards and an additional card is placed face-up beside the deck to start the discard pile. At your turn, you may either play a card to the discard pile or draw a card from the desk. You may discard anything that matches the top card on the pile either in color, number or action. A Wild card can be played at any time. When one person wins, the other tallies up the remaining cards, action cards are worth more.
