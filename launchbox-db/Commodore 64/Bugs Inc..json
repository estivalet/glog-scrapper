{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bugs Inc.", "overview": "Welcome new member of the great Bugs Incorporated family. Your first mission will be to exterminate the giant worm pests called 'Giant malum cimex' and the spiders 'Aspersos maculis aranea giant'. Whose favorite food is the species of flowers 'Meridionali flos giant'. Each of these insects have a subspecies that is differentiated by the color of its pigmentation. The slowest being the green ones and the fastest being the red ones. Your main tool will be your Comm-0-do-re 64 sprayer, which will eliminate each of them effectively. If you press its button several times, the shooting cloud will rise, making it a more deadly insecticide, as well as reach places that previously seemed inaccessible. For better control of your movements, plug your joystick into port 2 of the device. Your modern device will detect in the upper part of your display the number of eggs left for each of the separate insect variants by its pigmentation. Armed with his sprayer, you must make each and every one of the pests disappear from the 5 greenhouses where rare plant species is being grown.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "February 6, 2022", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Darro99", "publishers": "Bobr Games", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ilrXo1YcBQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/160042-bugs-inc\n"}
