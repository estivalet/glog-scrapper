{"altername_name": [], "name": "World Tour Golf", "overview": "World Tour Golf lets you play over a dozen well known courses, including Augusta and Pebble Beach. A split screen gives you an overhead view of the hole and a 3-D view. The control uses multiple button presses to set pace and draw/fade - fortunately a Driving Range is included to practice on. When you select a club, its range is superimposed on the view, making planning shots easier. Wind, pin placement and even weather conditions must be considered as you play your shot. Also included is a course architect for creating new courses or modifying existing ones.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Evan Robinson", "publishers": "Electronic Arts, Inc.", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Tour_Golf", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4t-yd5PyH8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/114013-world-tour-golf\n"}
