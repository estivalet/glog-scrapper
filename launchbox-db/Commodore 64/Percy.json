Percy has gone Pearl hunting, and jumping overboard, Percy will swim underwater over various levels to get back home with as many Pearls as he can get. On each screen are simple mazes and the Pearls, and Percy must collect all the pearls to open a gate and move to the next level. Also on screen are various sea creatures and these move in set patterns and must be avoided or you lose a life and the level has to be started again. A timer counts down and each level has to be completed before it reaches zero. Two players can play, with each player taking it in turns to play when the other player has lost a life. Before you start a game you are able to select the number of lives (1-5) and your skill level (1-3).", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "N.
