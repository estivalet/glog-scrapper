{"altername_name": ["Erik the Viking"], "name": "The Saga of Erik the Viking", "overview": "In this text adventure, you play the role of Erik the Viking. Upon returning home, you find your farm abandoned; your family has been kidnapped. You gather the things you need for a journey, and go rescue them. This game combines text adventure with graphics. The graphics illustrate the places you go, and are drawn on the screen as you watch. The display doesn't load a photo. Rather, a pen races around the screen, drawing the pictures in. While the picture is being drawn, the screen flickers. Although the pictures slow the game down a bit, they are done in a style reminiscent of Viking-age farms. In one scene, you are placed in the center of a longhouse, and they show the depression in the floor, just as can be seen in books.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Pete Austin", "publishers": "Level 9 Computing", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_the_Viking_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/112083-the-saga-of-erik-the-viking\n"}
