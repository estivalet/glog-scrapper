{"altername_name": [], "name": "Darkwood", "overview": "History of Darkwood Like most lands, the truth of Darkwood's origins are shrouded by the myths of cultural memory. It is a kingdom comprised of loosely aligned territories once ruled by the outworlder queen, Yannah. Since her apparent death some 5 years ago, the kingdom has fallen victim to all the ills caused by the politics of petty jealousies and power struggles. Other lands that were once allied or even a part of Darkwood have also suffered. Belynu is nearly at war. The City-State of the Shrines has become inaccessible, and Maegeca is lost, simply gone: people whisper of it as if it was never anything more than a myth.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Elise C.
