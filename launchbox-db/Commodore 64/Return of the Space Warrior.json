{"altername_name": ["Return of the Space Warriors"], "name": "Return of the Space Warrior", "overview": "Edward Egg, from the planet Egg, leads a difficult life. Living on Egg is a real headache since all the inhabitants are called Edward, which look like eggs. Edward's name is chosen, from a list of inhabitants also called Edward Egg, to defend the planet from the Space Warriors that have just returned. Edward climbs into his egg-shaped craft and sets out to destroy the Space Warriors, whose spaceships also happen to look like eggs. The battle takes place on the Egg Battle Platforms, an arena of ledges designed for combat. For Edward, the stakes are high; if he is attacked by the Space Warriors then they claim the Planet Egg as their own. Among the attacking hordes of warriors is a Colonel Warrior, who flies a Blue Eggship. Doing battle with the Colonial Warrior is rather difficult since his ferocity increases with each battle. The battle takes place under some strict rules. For a start, no weapons are to be used. On the top of each Eggship is an Egg destruct pad. Coming into contact with the pad causes the Eggship to explode and a Yolk Helmet is left behind to drop onto it reaches a ledge. Edward needs to collect the Yolk Helmet. Failure to do so will result in it being transformed into a Colonial Warrior. To make the battle fair, Edward's ship is also equipped with a Egg destruct pad, and the ship can explode the same way.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ian York", "publishers": "Alpha Omega Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/MnX9P0A37wE?t=57", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/111969-return-of-the-space-warrior\n"}
