{"altername_name": [], "name": "Scooby-Doo (MicroIllusions)", "overview": "A 3d style arcade adventure for Scooby and his pals. Microillusions struck up a deal with Hanna-Barbera for a series of their licences, to be worked on by Peter Ward. There were to be a series of titles including Jonny Quest, Flintstones, The Jetsons and finally Scooby Doo across the Amiga, PC and C64 \u2013 possibly sharing the same engine to get all the titles out there quickly. Microillusions made a terrible error though as they released The Jetsons to the world on the Amiga platform. They had shipped a Jetsons comic book serving as instructions with the game story background, which seemed like a great idea at the time. However, Hanna-Barbera never approved the title and were furious with Microillusions for releasing it. They revoked all their licences and this damaged Microillusions terribly \u2013 eventually contributing to them going bankrupt. As a result, most of the games never saw the light of day either. But most were complete and ready or close to ready to play. Scooby Doo overall is a lovely graphic adventure game for kids, with some cool action sequences. The game spans 5 D64 images overall and is packed with cartoon pictures. It\u2019s probably the best Scooby Doo game on the C64.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Peter Ward", "publishers": "MicroIllusions", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/126619-scooby-doo-microillusions\n"}
