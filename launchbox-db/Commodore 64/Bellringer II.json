{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bellringer II", "overview": "You are the Bellringer, and your mission this time is to collect as many bags of gold as possible from four castle towers. You will be awarded 750 pts for each bag collected. You move up through the towers by climbing ladders. At the top of each tower is a final ladder which needs to be fully raised by ringing five (out of eight) bells in the correct order. Every time you ring a correct bell, the ladder is raised a little. If you ring an incorrect bell, the ladder is lowered and you must ring the previous correct bell again. You need to be positioned just below a bell and then jump straight up to pull the bell's rope. When the final ladder is fully raised, you may climb to the top of the tower. Before proceeding to the next tower, you will be awarded a bonus which depends on how many bells you had to ring to fully raise the ladder. The bonus will be at least 1000 pts. Avoid the evil knights who guard the towers. Whenever you get too close to them, your health will decrease. You may pick up a small, yellow box located in one of the towers to refresh your health. The game will restart when you have completed all four towers, but your score will not be reset. The game ends when you run out of health.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2005", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Geir Straume", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/88268-bellringer-ii\n"}
