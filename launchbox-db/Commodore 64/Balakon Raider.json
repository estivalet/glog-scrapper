{"altername_name": ["Patrol"], "name": "Balakon Raider", "overview": "Several years have passed since the Earth was annexed to the Confederation and everything seemed to be going smoothly. But unfortunately, one day the alien barbarians infiltrated the land defense camp and took over the government residences of several provinces. You, aboard your super0equipped reconnaissance shuttle, have been instructed, as a modern sheriff, to chae these evil trainers through the corridors and floors of the buldings, destroying them all before moving on to the next building. But be very careful, because to stop your advance, some ghost aliens leave behind them dangerous mines, which will obstruct your path and will destroy you if you touch them. You will need to disintegrate them if you want to pass further.
