{"altername_name": [], "name": "Real Poltergeist", "overview": "Gavin Raeburn made Poltergeist for Codemasters while working at AGC Systems Ltd, but this is the game he wanted to make. You are in control of a exorcist space craft and you must destroy a Poltergeist. Before this though you have to fly over 32 levels and destroy his minions and generators (flashing boxes). After each generator is destroyed you need to land on a teleport pad to get to the next level. There are plenty of weapon upgrades to collect to complete your mission by collecting Power Transmuters.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gavin Raeburn", "publishers": "", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/125638-real-poltergeist\n"}
