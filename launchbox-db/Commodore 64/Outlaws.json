{"altername_name": [], "name": "Outlaws", "overview": "Many years ago, rode a band of men. They came from the East of the desert and with them they brought terror and destruction. Nobody was safe from the perils of a merciless death, no family was complete, no man was free. They were the OUTLAWS. Driven only by murderous ambition and selfish greed they scoured the land, leaving behind them a trail of death and pillage. Town after town they plundered, with no man left who could stop them and no man left alive who dare try. The townsfolk lived at their mercy and prayed that the evil band of men's dark shadow of doom would not pass over their valley. Frightened though they were, they still found hope, and they prayed that one day someone would come and deliver them from the OUTLAWS' evil tyranny.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dave Thomas", "publishers": "Ultimate Play the Game", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlaws_%281985_video_game%29", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJtYusDVX5c", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40300-outlaws\n"}
