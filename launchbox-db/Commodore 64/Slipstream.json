{"altername_name": [], "name": "Slipstream", "overview": "** SLIPSTREAM STORY ** In the year 14634 the inhabitants of the Omikron system built a shielding system to protect their home planets from asteroid showers that regularly struck their world. Something went wrong. An energy burst detected near the shielding station caused the robots defending the system to malfunction. The robots began to classify whole planets in nearby star systems as asteroids and began attacking them. It was only a matter of time before they started attacking inhabited worlds. The SLIPSTREAM starship was constructed as a way of stopping the robots. Your mission is to take control of the Slipstream through a remote interface, find the missing robots and destroy them.
