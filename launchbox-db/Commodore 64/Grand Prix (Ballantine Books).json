{"altername_name": [], "name": "Grand Prix (Ballantine Books)", "overview": "From the book \"Second Giant Book of Computer Games\". It doesn't matter if the OPEC ministers in our Oval Office program are cutting back on oil production, sending prices soaring throughout the world. With this program you've got a racing car you can drive without ever having to fill up on gas. As you'll see when you run it, the program (written by Ian Turtle, a British student) simulates driving a lap around a Grand Prix race track in a computer-controlled automobile. You're up against other top-rated drivers, so don't expect to win very often. The screen will show you details about the section of the course you're on and the maximum recommended speed for that part of the track. You can, if you feel brave, exceed that limit by up to a third. You'll also be told your position in the race, your average speed, the gear you're driving in, the accelerator setting, your speedometer reading, and the reading from your tachometer. You have to set the gears (1 to 5), brakes (0 to 2), and accelerator (from 1 upward): happy racing!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ian Turtle", "publishers": "Ballantine Books", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/102698-grand-prix-ballantine-books\n"}
