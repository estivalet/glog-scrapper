{"altername_name": [], "name": "Drag Racer", "overview": "This is a simulation of a drag race. The object of the game is to complete the quarter mile course in the shortest possible time. You have four gears and must determine the optimum moment for changing up. If you change too early, your revs will fall too low and you will lose valuable time; if you spend too much time in high revs you\u2019ll probably blow your engine. The rear end ratio of the car is progressively increased with each succeeding game, and the right moment to change gear becomes increasingly hard to judge.
