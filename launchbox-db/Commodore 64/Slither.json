{"altername_name": [], "name": "Slither", "overview": "Published in Ahoy! 1985/11 (Issue #23). Got fast reflexes? Then Slither is for you. The object is to collect prizes from the 40 rooms of a deserted castle by maneuvering the snake and avoiding walls and the snake's tail, which grows continuously (use a joystick in port 2). Collide with either, and you lose a life (you start with seven). If you succeed in gulping down the prize, you move to the next screen; the screens get more difficult as you go along. After you complete a screen you get a bonus which is the same as the value of the prize on the next screen. If you complete all 40, you get a bonus equal to the sum of the values of all 12 prizes.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nat Koch", "publishers": "Ion International, Inc.", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2vkHM5tpQE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/107423-slither\n"}
