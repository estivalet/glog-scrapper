You must travel through 99 mazes, before meeting the final demon. The game features different enemies as you progress through the mazes, with clues to progression built in. There's a 2-player co-operative mode. The in-built level editor uses pull-down menus, and offers a high level of flexibility. As well as creating actual levels, you can create a integrated storyline and game world, as the text on scrolls can be edited.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Micro Fort\u00e9", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.50", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon_Stalkers", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLOJchIH0U8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/96359-demon-stalkers\n"}
