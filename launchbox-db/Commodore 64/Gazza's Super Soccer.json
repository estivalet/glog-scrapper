{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gazza's Super Soccer", "overview": "This was the first of the two football games licensed around Paul Gascoigne, then the most expensive player in British football history. The game is viewed top down, and can be set to either move left-right or top-bottom. League and cup tournaments are included, as are single matches and set-piece practice sections (you have full control of these). The gameplay involves a number of advanced moves, and includes a gauge to control the exact dimensions of a kick (height and curl as well as strength), if you can use it quickly enough. Unusually, you have control over the goalkeeper, so can only blame yourself when you concede a goal. The players each have their own skills and strengths, and these develop as the game goes on \u2013 if you play well, your players become better, and more capable of facing better opposition.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Brian Rogers", "publishers": "Empire Interactive", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gazza's_Superstar_Soccer", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/31799-gazzas-super-soccer\n"}
