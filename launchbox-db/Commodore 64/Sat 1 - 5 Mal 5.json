There is an English version however, that was never released, but a rom is available for that version. In this game, based on a TV quiz show, two pairs play against each other in several rounds and are expected to guess a five letter word per round in just five tries. They only get the first letter as a default and can only get closer to the solution by using the same letters as in the words they use as a solution.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Roy O.
