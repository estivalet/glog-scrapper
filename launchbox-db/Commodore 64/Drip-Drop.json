{"altername_name": [], "name": "Drip-Drop", "overview": "Catch the falling raindrops from the stormy skies and keep the home fires burning, remember we didn't start the fires. They were always burning as the world's been turning. You have 3 buckets to catch the raindrops in, If you miss a drop it hits the fire and the top bucket disappears. When you've missed three drops the fires go out both in game and metaphorically. Oh no! I think I hear thunder, better grab your buckets and get ready!
