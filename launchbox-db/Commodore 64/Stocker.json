{"altername_name": [], "name": "Stocker", "overview": "Race from coast to coast across the southern USA in this stock car racer, which takes you from Florida to California through freeways, bridges, side routes and country roads (and if you're so inclined, through houses and water bodies too). As your car zooms in top-down view along the bends, forks and intersections, your only rival is the clock - represented by a fuel tank that only lasts 90 seconds, no matter your speed. Strewn along the track are a few gas stations, crucial for keeping your tank from going dry. Traffic and other racers may get in your way, but the real nuisance is the police: any encounter with a squad car will get you ticketed, which detracts from your score (and may eventually end your game, depending on settings). You're free to leave the asphalt and rough it off-road, or to veer off course by taking the question-marked forks (which may or may not shorten your route).", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "July 21, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Pacific Dataworks International", "publishers": "Capcom U.S.A.", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stocker_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uh_sWOZQmVU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/122126-stocker\n"}
