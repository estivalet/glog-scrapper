{"altername_name": [], "name": "Match Day II", "overview": "The controls consist of four directions (allowing eight directions including diagonals) and a shot button. Each team has seven players including goalkeeper and there are league and cup options available. The game is highly addictive due to its difficulty level, the complete control over ball direction, power and elevation (using a Diamond Deflection System), and the importance of tactics and player positioning over the field (barging if necessary), which makes it challenging to break strong defences.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "August 1, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "John Darnell", "publishers": "Ocean Software", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Match_Day_II", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvzIqyVfCQI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6145-match-day-ii\n"}
