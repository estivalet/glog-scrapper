{"altername_name": [], "name": "SAS Combat Simulator", "overview": "SAS Combat Simulator is a military scrolling shooter. The title refers to the British SAS special forces. The player controls a soldier across four levels , in jungle, desert or swamp areas. Each level consists of two phases, where the goal is always to get to the end of the path. The first phase is a shooter with a top view similar to Commando , but the sliding direction varies during the course; in each level there are one or more horizontal sliding sections to the right or vertical upwards. The soldier can walk and shoot in eight directions and initially he is equipped with a rifle and a limited supply of grenades. The latter are launched in all directions by holding down the fire button for a long time and replacing them by picking up refills. Other power-ups allow you to get off-road, tank, smart bomb , rapid fire, etc .; vehicles are immune to simple bullets, but in many versions, while moving in all directions, they always point forward. The common enemies are armed soldiers like the protagonist, but they also meet vehicles, artillery posts and crocodiles. The second phase is a fighting game with a profile view and a scroll to the right. Enemy soldiers on foot come from both sides. The controls are limited to horizontal movement and to strike with a knife. The action is based on timing in hitting enemies at close range before they do the same.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Vision Software", "publishers": "Codemasters Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAS_Combat_Simulator", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu-3XFcjjc8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109615-sas-combat-simulator\n"}
