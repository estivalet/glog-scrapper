{"altername_name": [], "name": "L\u2019Abbaye des Morts", "overview": "From the programmer that brought you the magnificent PLANET GOLF comes L\u2019Abbaye des Morts, an exciting arcade adventure for the C64. The game was originally released on the PC (featuring ZX Spectrum style graphics) and now Antonio Savona and Saul Cross have teamed up to produce this superb C64 version of the game. Featuring beautifully detailed hi-res graphics, sumptuous soundtracks and gorgeous presentation this is an unmissable treat for arcade adventure fans! L\u2019Abbaye des Morts was released by Psytronik as a LIMITED EDITION tape in a deluxe clamshell cassette case which sold out very quickly. The game is still available to order on floppy disk and as a digital download from our friends at Double Sided Games. ** STORY** In the 13th century, the Cathars, clerics who preached about the poverty of Christ and defended life without material aspirations, were treated as heretics by the Catholic Church and expelled out of the Languedoc region in France. One of them, called Jean Raymond, found an old church in which to hide from crusaders, not knowing that beneath its ruins lay buried an ancient evil.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2019", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Locomalito", "publishers": "Double Sided Games", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrTeA2gnVX8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/115265-labbaye-des-morts\n"}
