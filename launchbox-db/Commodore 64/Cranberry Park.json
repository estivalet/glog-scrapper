{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cranberry Park", "overview": "A strategy game created by Gloria Fowler and published in 1988 in Loadstar #055. In Cranberry Park, you design your own dream playground. Have you ever wondered why, all over the world, park engineers suddenly go berserk and end up engaging in senseless frenzy? Well, Dr. Gloria Fowler's game may provide you at least a partial explanation as to why such strife exists in the municipal world of red tape and even redder faces. Maybe you'll gain an appreciation for the tough job your Park Commissioner has, or then again, maybe not. Cranberry Park makes you subject to the whims of the Cranberry Cover Recreation Committee. You must plan and build a new park for the town within the limits of your deadline. But there are obstacles. You can't jut place the toddler section of the park next to the duck pond. The kids might harass the alligators, right? Among your worries is a certain vacillating fellow by the name of Nathan Terrupt, a member of the committee who thinks himself a better landscaper than you. He thinks nothing of having you fill in a wading pool with 40 tons of dirt and gouging out another one elsewhere ASAP. The rules of the committee will fluctuate, and your plan needs to change with it. Juggle the parts to meet the requirements and do it fast, the deadline is nearly up!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gloria Fowler", "publishers": "Softdisk Publishing, Inc.", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/94207-cranberry-park\n"}
