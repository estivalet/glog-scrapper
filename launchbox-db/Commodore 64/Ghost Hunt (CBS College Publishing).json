{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ghost Hunt (CBS College Publishing)", "overview": "A type-in game published in the book \"Arcade Games for the Commodore 64\". Three friends are out late at night trying to catch the slippery, tricky neighborhood ghost. She is a slippery, tricky ghost, and in order to capture her, all three figures must touch her at once without touching each other. You are allowed a certain amount of time to catch the ghost. After you have caught her, you can play again, but each time she will be moving faster and the amount of time allowed to catch her will be shorter. You will accumulate points based on the length of time you take to catch each ghost. The game ends when the time runs out and the ghost has not been captured.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Igor TulchinskyIgor", "publishers": "CBS College Publishing", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/102142-ghost-hunt-cbs-college-publishing\n"}
