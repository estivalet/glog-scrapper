In the UK there is a BBC television soap-opera called 'Eastenders' which concerns the lives of everyday normal London folk living in Walford's Albert Square.

The story concerns Effi who's lost her little Willie. The player takes the role of PC Donald \"Dirty\" Dance who must investigate Herbert Square and its residents to solve the mystery. In this game there are no player aids such as command lists or command icons. All instructions must be typed out in full.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Charles A.
