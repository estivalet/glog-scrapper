{"altername_name": ["Gran Prix (Open Game)"], "name": "Speed Racer", "overview": "Which are more powerful, the urge to hurt and punish or the better angels of our nature? This game lets you decide. You speed down the highway, avoiding police, roadblocks and potholes and you can choose to avoid the pesky jaywalkers and crossing grandmothers or to smash them to bloody bits. Rack up your angel points or amass a heap of devilish points and get a high score in either section. But what would Racer X think? Published in Italy as Gran Prix in both Open Game - Super Open Game Pasqua (1985) and Open Game n.4 (Dicembre 1984).", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Chris Warling", "publishers": "Centro Studi Editoriale s.r.l", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amezAFdOpX0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/76087-speed-racer\n"}
