{"altername_name": ["Mysterious Adventures No:4"], "name": "Escape from Pulsar 7", "overview": "Escape From Pulsar 7 is the fourth title in the Mysterious Adventure series of illustrated text adventures by Brian Howarth. It has a science-fiction theme influenced by the hit film \"Alien\". The player finds themselves trapped alone on a giant space ship. The rest of the crew are dead, killed by a mutated zoo specimen. The player's goal is ultimately that they must escape the ship in a life pod to avoid being the creature's next meal. Explore the bunks of your comrades to find the tools needed. Only useful items can be taken, so the gameplay is quite linear, with several maze sections. These games used the Scott Adams adventure engine, and thus also have the same features - a basic 2-word parser, small vocabulary, and brief descriptions. They were similar to other adventures of the time.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Brian Howarth", "publishers": "Channel 8 Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4TDHvUpfBI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/99401-escape-from-pulsar-7\n"}
