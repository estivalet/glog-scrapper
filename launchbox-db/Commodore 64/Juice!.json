{"altername_name": [], "name": "Juice!", "overview": "Juice! is a single player side scrolling game with 6 levels of intensity, where Edison, the Kinetic Android (the player's avatar), competes against an array of obstructionist enemies to complete a working closed circuit board. 'Nohms' are electrical charges that quickly appear and begin bouncing around the grid. A single contact with one can cause Edison to melt into oblivion. As they disappear, they leave behind a single 'Capacitor' which quickly evolves into a nasty 'Killerwatt', which targets Edison as it begins zipping around the grid in its pursuit. Meanwhile Edison is looking for the benevolent 'Recharge', to continue his energizing power. Complications occur when 'Flash, the Lightning Dolt' begins disassembling all the good work Edison has accomplished. The player must try to complete the circuits and keep Edison ahead of his enemies.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "System 3 Software", "publishers": "Tronix Publishing", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HklIf_hll_Y", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/98440-juice\n"}
