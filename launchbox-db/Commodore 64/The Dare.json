{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Dare", "overview": "The night started off so well in The Swan pub for you, Frederick Davies, celebrating your final examinations after years of hard studying for a degree in law. After a few drinks you have been convinced to take on a dare where you are stripped and placed in a closed department store, and your goal is to escape. Pushed into a toilet cubicle you bang your head and knocked-out where you eventually wake up. With a bleeding head in the dark, you must sort your head out, get out of the cubicle before attempting to leave the store without setting off alarms or getting caught. If you do get caught then your career in law will be ruined. The Dare is a text adventure where text on the screen describes your location. You type in commands with the keyboard to interact with your surroundings.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Base 7 Software", "publishers": "Atlas Adventure Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/95664-the-dare\n"}
