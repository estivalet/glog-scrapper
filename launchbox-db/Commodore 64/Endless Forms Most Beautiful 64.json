{"altername_name": [], "name": "Endless Forms Most Beautiful 64", "overview": "Imps exist. Just beyond our limited perceptions and in numerous variety. Imps are responsible for your keys going missing or that missing sock from the laundry. Two clans want the imps. The Moebius clan from the 48th plane of existence and the Puckies from the ZX quadrant. Who will be the ultimate victor? In EFMB: Endless Forms Most Beautiful, you will play as either Moebius or Pucky. To clear a screen, gather all the imps from each level but beware the enemies on some levels. If you move off the screen to the left, you will reappear on the opposite side, one level lower. Moving off the screen to the right is the opposite: you will appear one level higher to the left. Also, there are teleporters on the levels. If you stand on a teleporter and push up or down, you will move up or down one level. Try to clear as many levels as you can. This is a C64 remake of the 2012 ZX Spectrum game of the same name by Dave Hughes.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "July 21, 2019", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Rikib80", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVlf4SPNPvM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/121593-endless-forms-most-beautiful-64\n"}
