The games are based on a so-called 2 word parser system and have been optimized for simplicity and speed of operation. Back in the mid-eighties, these adventure games were partially programmed by eb but never completed. The cave was in the old original version a few rooms large and was completely reprogrammed in March 2005 (including graphics). The search for an occult relic takes you near a bizarre town called Innsmouth. Your old friend Prof. Benton, a specialist and explorer of occult objects, gave you the advice to search for an old cave in the wilderness near Innsmouth. According to ancient traditions, there could be one of the many keys to solving the mystery of the Great Elder. After a short search in the wilderness, the cave entrance opens up in front of you. Everything else is up to you.
