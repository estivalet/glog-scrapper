The game was released by Domark for the Amiga, Atari ST, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, DOS computers, and ZX Spectrum in 1988. Live and Let Die is a racing game in which the player navigates James Bond driving a modified speedboat. It did not start as a Bond game, being a rebranding after Domark saw Elite Systems International working on a game named Aquablast, and thought the boat driving and fighting of said title resembled the speedboat chase of Live and Let Die.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Elite Systems", "publishers": "Domark Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.57", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_and_Let_Die_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrS1hcyNIDs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73430-ian-flemings-james-bond-007-in-live-and-let-die-the-computer-game\n"}
