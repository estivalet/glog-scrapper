Fortunately you have at your disposal a Northall Q15 helicopter-jet hybrid, with advanced weaponry, a zoomable radar and strong shields. Rescue on Fractalus is a good guide to what to expect - the action is first-person and depicted in 3D, with hovercrafts and aircraft among your potential targets. There are various game modes including air and ground combat of varying intensity levels, as well as 5 skill levels and full training modes, as well as ten set-piece scenarios.The tactical screen must be used to pick out troublesome sectors and launch advance attacks on them.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Icon Design", "publishers": "Mastertronic, Inc.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109612-prowler\n"}
