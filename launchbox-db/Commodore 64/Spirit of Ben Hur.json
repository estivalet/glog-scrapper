Rules/gameplay: There are two goals to the game: try to build UP the foundations by suit from the ace to the king; and try to do it with as few spins of the tableau as Possible. The aces are removed from the deck and placed in the \"Colosseum area\" forming the four foundations. Then fourteen cards are dealt around the foundations The rest of the cards are placed face down and turned one at a time to a Single waste Pile. The top card of the waste pile is available for play to the tableau or the foundations. Cards in the tableau Can be played to the foundation only if they are in the same row or the same column as the foundation Pile. There is no building in the tableau. Empty spaces in the tableau may be filled from the waste Pile only. The game is won if all cards are built to the foundation. The game can be played with either a joystick or a mouse.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "G.F.
