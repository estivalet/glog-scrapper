{"altername_name": [], "name": "Oracle III", "overview": "The idea of the game is to clear each screen by pushing blocks to match up a minimum of two or more squares. The game has three difficulty settings and an unlockable fourth setting that can be accessed once you have mastered 'hard' mode. ORACLE III features 32 levels on each difficulty setting - making a total of 128 levels for you to solve! The game is very nicely presented with a good selection of options - including difficulty settings, the option to toggle in-game music + sfx, the option to remove the level backgrounds leaving only the puzzle blocks on-screen and you can even change your character colour!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2011", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tufan Uysal", "publishers": "Psytronik Software", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/GbiP3EfPVGU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/123199-oracle-iii\n"}
