{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ball Trap", "overview": "A crosshairs shooter created by Arnaud Hervas and published in Hebdogiciel N\u00b0146-149 (01.08.1986) where you must hit the skeet\\trap shooting disks and the balloons. The speed and amount of items being thrown out increases as you qualify for the round and move on to the next one. At level 3 some of the ballloons come straight up from behind the mountains or travel quickly from top to bottom, making your shots much more difficult. Your crosshairs will loop from the top and bottom of the screen to the other side if that helps.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "August 1, 1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Arnaud Hervas", "publishers": "Hebdogiciel", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbKy2oWCFkY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148729-ball-trap\n"}
