{"altername_name": ["Hardhat Construction Co."], "name": "Hard Hat Construction Co.", "overview": "Hardhat is an honest, hardworking employee but his supervisor is a lazy worker who steals your bricks instead of getting his own. The mad company doctor will try to paralyze you with his injections and the crazy welder would rather weld you than a piece of metal. You need to avoid all of these while continuing to build your walls. You travel from the brick pile at the bottom of the building up to the top floor to continue building upwards. Good luck and avoid the falling bricks!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "SuperNova Software", "publishers": "The Software Lab", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjEwmQYPFtg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/104317-hard-hat-construction-co\n"}
