{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hangman (Cascade Games)", "overview": "A game of the notorious \"Cassette 50\" collection and also in the equally ill-famed 75 Spill Datatronic collection. This is a basic version of the pencil-and-paper game hangman. A mystery word is presented by an amount of underlines equal to the letters in the word you need to guess. Each letter you guess incorrectly builds first the gallows pole and then the rope and then the figure of the hanged man. If the man is built completely you lose the game. If a game has double-letters you will need to guess them twice, it doesn't autofill all instances of the letter, which is non-standard but it makes it a bit more of a challenge.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Cascade Games", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/103160-hangman-cascade-games\n"}
