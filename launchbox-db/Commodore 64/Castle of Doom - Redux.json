{"altername_name": [], "name": "Castle of Doom: Redux", "overview": "A remake of the Melbourne House Castle of Doom (or the Courbouis Software Dutch version if you prefer, which itself wasfrom the book \"Commodore 64 Games Book\". In 2017 it was dusted off and updated by Marco Pistorio and Esteban Palladino. Like the original you can explore the rooms within the castle walls, look for treasure and try to avoid the slime monsters and killer robots. Points are gained by moving over question marks and killing monsters or robots with your Proton gun. As you move off the screen from one room you are presented with another. Move back and you return to the same room but now with different contents! You are killed if you touch the electrified walls or any of the monsters. Some monsters are faster than others and the robots are very dangerous.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2017", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Esteban Palladino", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfXpKmGrUNY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164959-castle-of-doom-redux\n"}
