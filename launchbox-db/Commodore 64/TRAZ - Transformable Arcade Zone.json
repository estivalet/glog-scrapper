{"altername_name": [], "name": "TRAZ: Transformable Arcade Zone", "overview": "Transformable Arcade Zone is a Breakout clone with multiple paddles, 64 levels and a built-in level construction set. Each level can have different set of paddles, sometimes one at the top and one at the bottom, sometimes one left one right, sometimes four stacked-up etc. This gives each level a distinctly new gameplay. There are unbreakable blocks, monster generators (also unbreakable) and glass refractors that change the balls movement angle as it passes through. After a level is cleared, the player must choose the next level by moving on a 8x8 grid of levels.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jon K.
