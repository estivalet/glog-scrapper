Aliens are present, which can shoot at the player, as well as land-mines and 20 indestructible robots to block the player's path. There are 3 mazes to clear, each of which has a wrap-around design similar to the original Pac-man game and fills more than one screen. The player have five lives in which to progress as far as possible and try to beat the high score.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Vortex Software", "publishers": "Ocean Software Ltd.", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_2", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke2b3T7b_cc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/87155-android-2\n"}
