{"altername_name": ["Put"], "name": "Ditris", "overview": "Ditris is a straight Tetris variant without gameplay additions besides a split-screen multiplayer mode. Differently shaped blocks fall from the top of the screen and can be turned and moved left and right on the way to the bottom. The goal is to create full horizontal lines which vaporize after completion: more lines at once reward more points for the high score. The next block is shown in a preview screen and the game is over when a block can't fall far enough to leave the top of the screen. Published in Italy under the name Put in both Special Program n.79 (settembre 1991) and Hit Parade C64 n.62 (Dicembre 1991).", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Thomas Mittelmeyer", "publishers": "Edizioni Societ\u00e0 SIPE", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/hTMjXNBAPOM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/96596-ditris\n"}
