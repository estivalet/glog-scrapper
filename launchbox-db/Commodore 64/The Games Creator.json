{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Games Creator", "overview": "THE GAMES CREATOR The Games Creator is designed to allow you to easily make your own games. No special knowledge of machine code or programming experience is necessary. Whilst writing many computer games we developed various 'editors' to help speed up the games writing process. A compilation of these editors in 'user friendly' format makes the basis for the idea of the Games Creator. When using the Games Creator you will quickly become familiar with many of the advanced facilities of the Commodore 64. The program has been ingeniously constructed to be truly user friendly whilst containing very extensive facilities as games designing skills are developed. Games Creating is a new art-form, should you need any help, or have suggestions or ideas we would be pleased to hear from you. We hope you enjoy being a Games Creator!
