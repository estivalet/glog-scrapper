{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mega Thrusterball", "overview": "Because of this game from Ben Hermans, Kevin Murphy and Raoul Jacobs (of Legendary Designs), published in Loadstar #125 and in Loadstar #130, when you think of Tasmania, you'll think of wild joystick games with hundreds of rooms to explore. Of course, each room is full of things to zap before they zap you. You must shut down 40 or more reactors placed all around the MEGA universe. The reactors are tall, blue metallic objects with a hemisphere on top. In one player mode you control the Thrusterball and a drone, in two player mode one person controls each of the two. The drone can go anywhere on screen, but can only fire in 4 directions. Only alien bullets can damage the drone. A hit drone will turn gray and powerless for a minute. the Thrusterball can be damaged by touching aliens or their bullets. When its energy reaches zero you lose a life, the next time you lose a life you lose your weapons too! Weapons, pick-ups and credits can be managed. Some pick-ups are good, others are bad.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Legendary Designs", "publishers": "Softdisk Publishing", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "2.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU5C9tmTT-4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/118404-mega-thrusterball\n"}
