Choose a number and look at the the picture that's revealed underneath. Then choose another number and look at that picture. Match them and they'll stay turned up. Keep picking pairs until all the pictures are matched and the entire game board is uncovered to reveal a favorite Fisher-Price toy. As you get better, the boards get harder, with more numbers and more pictures to remember!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Spinnaker Software", "publishers": "Fisher-Price Learning Software", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/105970-i-can-remember\n"}
