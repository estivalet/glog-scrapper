Ereth, the evil Lord Death, was jealous of the royal family of Carus for they were greatly loved by their people. He resolved to do them great harm and concocted a powerful spell which turned them all to stone. The only way to reverse the spell is to locate the five magical gems that are scattered throughout the land.
