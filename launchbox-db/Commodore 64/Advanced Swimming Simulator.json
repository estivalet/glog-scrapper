Where you are swimming the Atlantic Ocean, and must try and get to the island. The only trouble is, you can easily get lost. You have a very long distance to travel and swim to the shore.

It is impossible to swim across the whole Atlantic Ocean don't you think?", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2004", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Richard Bayliss", "publishers": "The New Dimension (TND)", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86687-advanced-swimming-simulator\n"}
