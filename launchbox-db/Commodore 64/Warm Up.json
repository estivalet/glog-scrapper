{"altername_name": [], "name": "Warm Up", "overview": "Warm Up is a top-down racing game based on the Formula 1. The player has the choice between eight cars which differ in the gearing system (automatic or manual), acceleration and maximum speed. Other customizing options concern the tires, spoiler, damper and steering sensitivity. Those effect how the car controls during the races and can also be changed during pit stops. The available playing modes (all in three difficulty levels) are training, single races and a whole season in which the 16 courses (based on the real ones) are arranged in a linear order.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Antonio Miscellaneo", "publishers": "Genias", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-z_EfZUQPI4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/124034-warm-up\n"}
