{"altername_name": ["Tuffatori"], "name": "Aqua", "overview": "This was on a free promotional cassette by Mastertronic in 1984. It came free with several magazines, as well as bundled free with a few other Mastertonic games as well. One side had a slideshow of other Mastertronic releases, and on the other side was Aqua. The game itself is an arcade collect 'em up which you can play 1-2 players (simultaneously against each other). You play a big-nosed character in a boat, and your goal is to collect a bunch of stuff while diving in the boat, and avoiding fish and other sea creatures. There is also an Air Supply meter, in which if you stay dove down in the water, you air would run out and you die. Released as Tuffatori in Italy in Linguaggio Macchina C64/ZX n.5 (Aprile 1985).", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tony Kelly", "publishers": "Edizioni Foglia", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.42", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_udw8ET74c", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75402-aqua\n"}
