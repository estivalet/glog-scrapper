{"altername_name": [], "name": "Eight Off", "overview": "A type of solitaire game published in Loadstar #164. An easy to beat version of solitaire, a perfect game for the end of the day. Normally the game (FreeCell and Baker's game were based off of Eight Off!) has 20 stacks, so a much easier version than FreeCell, so some variation was added to give it some additional complexity, so in this version the number of piles is reduced to four by default. Only Kings may be played to the empty spaces in the tableau. To give you some variation, you are allowed to choose the amount of stacks for an easier or more difficult game. An option exists to allow more than just Kings can be played to the empty tableau spaces. So you can play the game any way you want! Toggling A at FROM prompt allows the computer to make all possible plays to the foundation automatically, this may help some beginning players and speed things for advanced ones.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Maurice Jones", "publishers": "J & F Publishing, Inc.", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/98077-eight-off\n"}
