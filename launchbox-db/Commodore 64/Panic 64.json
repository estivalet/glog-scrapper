{"altername_name": [], "name": "Panic 64", "overview": "In this game, the object is to destroy the red monsters in the level. This can be done by laying bombs on the platforms that these monsters are on. When these bombs are detonated, they leave a hole in the platform, and when the monsters fall through these, they drop down a level, destroying them. As the player progresses through the game, the monsters need to be dropped through more levels to kill them. Lives are lost when the player touches a monster or when they are in the vicinity of the bomb when it detonates.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ian Gray", "publishers": "Interceptor Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIjWE2rAL0c", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/111780-panic-64\n"}
