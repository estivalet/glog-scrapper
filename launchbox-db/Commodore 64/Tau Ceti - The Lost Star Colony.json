{"altername_name": ["Tau Ceti", "Tau Ceti"], "name": "Tau Ceti: The Lost Star Colony", "overview": "Humanity has spread out and colonised nearby star systems but a plague in 2150 led to the colonies being abandoned and left to their automated robotic maintenance systems. While several of these colonies have been successfully re-inhabited, the colony on the planet Tau Ceti III (orbiting the star Tau Ceti) has been uncontactable since a meteor smashed into the planet. A mission sent to Tau Ceti III in 2164 landed on the planet but broadcast a mayday message followed by silence. Experts decided that the planet's robots were running amok as a result of the meteorite impact. The only chance, it was decided, of successfully stopping the defence systems without destroying the cities already there is to send a single pilot in an armoured Gal-Corp skimmer to the planet's surface with the task of shutting-down the central reactor in Tau Ceti III's capital, Centralis.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "August 1, 1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "CRL Group", "publishers": "CRL Group", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.52", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tau_Ceti_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnM3ZAY8wLY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6157-tau-ceti-the-lost-star-colony\n"}
