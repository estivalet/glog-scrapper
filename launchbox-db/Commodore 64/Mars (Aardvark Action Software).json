{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mars (Aardvark Action Software)", "overview": "You ship crashed on the Red Planet and you have to get home. You will have to explore a Martian City, repair your ship and deal with possibly hostile aliens to get home again. This is a game recommended as a first adventure. It is in no way simple and playing time normally runs from 30 to 50 hours but it is constructed in a more \"open\" manner to let you try out Adventuring and get used to the game before you hit the really tough problems. A game by Rodger Olsen and available on both cassette and disk.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Rodger Olsen", "publishers": "Aardvark Action Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/99397-mars-aardvark-action-software\n"}
