{"altername_name": [], "name": "Escape (TimSoft)", "overview": "Escape is a platform game. The task of the player is to find 13 crystal cubes in order to get out of the labyrinth by the magical portal. The protagonist is weaponless, so the only way to avoid enemies is a good timing and jumping ability. The maze is inhabited by numerous hostile creatures. Contact with them or with purple ladder and floor takes some amount of energy. A fall from the heights or contact with falling rocks takes life. Some useful items may be found in the maze, for example extra energy and surprise pack, with various numbers of points. Points are necessary to access local teleports, moving to another part of the labyrinth.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Art Core Entertainment Software", "publishers": "TimSoft", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/99238-escape-timsoft\n"}
