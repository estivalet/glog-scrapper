{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bonkey Kong", "overview": "Bonkey Kong awoke one morning with a very peculiar feeling. It stayed with him all day, eventually prompting him to seek the advice of his Dad. \"Son, you have reached the age where every young Kong must fulfill his destiny. Follow your instinct to take your rightful place in the world. Good luck.\" And so, Bonkey Kong then knew exactly what he must do. You are Bonkey Kong! Fulfill your destiny by taking your place on top of an unfinished building with the love of your life! (Whom you have plucked randomly from the street below...) Use a joystick in port 2 to move left and right. Press the fire button to throw barrels at the workers who will climb the building and try to stop you. Please note: Due to a series of accidents in the 80's, the Kong Workers Union have imposed new restrictions: Only one barrel can be thrown at a time.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "October 1, 2016", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Graham Axten", "publishers": "Pond Software Ltd.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66hj2M62IgU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/82657-bonkey-kong\n"}
