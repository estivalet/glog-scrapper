{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Prince", "overview": "The object of the game is to build something to rescue the princess, but also prove your bravery and acquire enough wealth to convince her into escaping with you. This means collecting all of the parts of the craft that are scattered through the land, scoring enough points to prove your bravery and collecting enough gold and jewels to build up your wealth. She doesn't want much does she! Failure to complete all these tasks will result in the princess refusing to escape with you. The problem with all of this is that the items you need are hidden within very difficult sub-games, which are quite strange and very confusing. You will need to explore most of the game map to find these sub-games, but also avoid or fight the numerous hordes that attack you on your travels.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Marcus Charleville", "publishers": "Firebird Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgQFCeK6GpQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/111859-the-prince\n"}
