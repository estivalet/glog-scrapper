{"altername_name": [], "name": "Startrip", "overview": "A shooter, created by Ulrich M\u00fchl and published in Compute mit 1987/04. The story: \"Teaching them a lesson was too much,\" were General Adok's last intelligible words before his voice was drowned out by the roaring applause of the Earth Security Council. In fact, it was pretty daring of the Tronicians to invade Earth with a fleet of starships every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. (The other days of the week they are on their way back to Omnibus III, their home planet and On Sundays the defeat is clearly too much, now we're going to celebrate.). They arrive at the STAD 35 space military base and verify the functionality of their equipment. So now there's no turning back. One press of \"Trip\" and off you go, right into the middle of the retreating Tronician space fleet. The fact that the \"Trip\" button got stuck and after more or less long hunting periods is a technical issue we will be working through, and since the end event is that the ship gets transferred 2,735 light years away is a definite kink in our plans, but workable. But now everything will change. General Adok equips you (no one knows why ) with a somewhat outdated Wazda c-7b v2 xy space garbage glider with a standard piercer projectile launcher and gives you 2 bottles of wine to put you in a celebratory mood and gives you the honorable task of giving the Tronicians a good beating.
