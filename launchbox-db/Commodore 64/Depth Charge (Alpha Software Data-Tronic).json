{"altername_name": ["Dyp Bomber"], "name": "Depth Charge (Alpha Software/Data-Tronic)", "overview": "Released as part of the \"75 Spill Datatronic\" Collection. Released in Norway as Dyp Bomber. Do you remember the numbering game in the Commodore 64 manual, where the point was to guess a number between 0 and 100? Deep Bomber is a Battleships-inspired variant of that game. Here you will find nine hidden submarines, in a grid of 9 \u00d7 9 routes. There is one submarine in each row. So then just guess. Row 1, column 1. Bomb. Row 1, column 2. Boom. Line 1, column 3. Match. Row 2, column 1. Bomb. You see the drawing. You have 40 attempts to find all the submarines. Deep Bombs can hardly be characterized as a game. You get no hints about where the submarines are, and there is no information that can be used to reason their positions. All you know is that if you have found the submarine in one row, you can move on to the next one. Of all the games so far, Deep Bomber is the most meaningless. It has no positive qualities whatsoever.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Alpha Software Ltd.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w18HMfdoVM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/96418-depth-charge-alpha-softwaredata-tronic\n"}
