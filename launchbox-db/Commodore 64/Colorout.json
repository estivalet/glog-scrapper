{"altername_name": [], "name": "Colorout", "overview": "Even if your name isn't Joshua, here's your chance to get rid of some frustration by knocking down some walls. Colorout is a fast-paced one-person game that challenges you to knock as many bricks as possible out of a brightly colored, six-course wall. The missiles you use are ten high-speed balls, kept in play with a movable paddle you control. The wall wall stretches across the screen, the balls come at it from below and the paddle moves back and forth along the bottom of the screen. Hold down the button to double the speed of the paddle. Try putting a little english on the ball for those tough shots or bounce it off the end of the paddle for a steeper angle. Action starts slow but increases as you go. Ball that bounce off the ceiling take out every brick they pass coming down. the game is over when you've lost all 10 balls.
