{"altername_name": [], "name": "Move It", "overview": "A 2 player only puzzle game published in 64'er 1991/11. As a mental challenge, we can recommend the game by Daniel Schulz. The game is played in pairs using a joystick. The game is a grid of seven times seven squares, on which each player has 24 stones in an even distribution. Logically, one field remains empty. It is now alternately moved into the respective empty field, either one's own or an opponent's piece can be moved. Only a stone that has just been moved must remain standing on the next move. Whoever manages to get four of their own stones connected in a row or column or, if you are very tame, to have them brought. A new game starts with a touch of the SPACE key. If this seems too easy for you, after loading the game you can use POKE 325X,(number-l) there the number of connected stones required can be increased if you think your nerves can take the strain.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Daniel Schulz", "publishers": "Markt & Technik", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/122769-move-it\n"}
