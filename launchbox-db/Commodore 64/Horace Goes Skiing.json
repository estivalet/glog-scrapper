{"altername_name": [], "name": "Horace Goes Skiing", "overview": "\u201cHorace Goes Skiing\u201d, released in 1982, was a spin-off from the successful \u201cHungry Horace\u201d. \u201cHorace Goes Skiing\u201d is initially similar to the arcade game \u201cFrogger\u201d. In this instance, Horace has to negotiate a busy and dangerous road, in order to get to the ski shop, to rent a pair of skis. Horace has a starting purse of $40, from which every ambulance fee (when you get hit on the road) costs $10, and the skis themselves will set Horace back $10. Once Horace manages to rent the skis, he has to make his way down the slope, negotiating the flags and not hitting any trees. Once you complete each course, or if you hit a tree, you are sent back to the beginning.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "January 1, 1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Beam Software", "publishers": "Melbourne House", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.38", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horace_(video_game_series)#Horace_Goes_Skiing", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59kh65YyqN4&t=276s", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/32318-horace-goes-skiing\n"}
