{"altername_name": ["Adept: Space Waste II"], "name": "Adept: Space Waste 2", "overview": "Adept: Space Waste 2 (also known as Adept: Space Waste II) is the followup to Alan Bond's 1985 game Space Waste. This time however, the game has more variety, as there is different types of enemies to kill, and unlike Space Waste, this game has joystick support. The game plays similar to Space Invaders or Galaxian. Every wave features the same enemy like in the original, except the enemies change from wave to wave. So instead of facing diamond shaped spaceships in every wave, you end up facing a typical space invader in one wave, and the next wave you're facing asteroids, etc.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Alan Bond", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/163355-adept-space-waste-2\n"}
