{"altername_name": ["Minotaurus"], "name": "Living in a Maze", "overview": "Starlight #3. Find the keys to the doors and make your way out of the maze of twisty passages. You have been offered a wonderful job opportunity that you absolutely do not want to miss. But unfortunately, your arch enemy, having learned of the situation, has decided to prevent you from reaching your appointment on time. He tricked you into a spinning shuttle and locked you up in a maze. The only way to defeat your enemy will be to wander around your prison and try to reach the way out. Collect the keys to open the various doors and beware that some walls are illusory. But also remember that traps of various kinds are sown almost everywhere: some deadly, others to carry you from one part of the labyrinth to the other. Good luck!
