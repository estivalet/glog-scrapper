{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gothmog's Lair", "overview": "Gothmog's Lair is an interactive fiction adventure in a fantasy setting. There are no general location graphics; instead there are small animated graphics of key moments. The game includes character interaction and is 'real-time', meaning the other characters (such as animals and thieves) move around at the same time as you do. However, movement and combat are turn-based - you make a move, then the NPCs do. Commands include MOVE, GET and ATTACK, requiring two-letter direction initials.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sean A.
