{"altername_name": ["Airwolf 64"], "name": "Airwolf", "overview": "The game of the TV show is viewed from the side and puts you in command of an attack helicopter. Your task is to rescue 5 scientists from an underground lair by destroying its layer of protection and then getting to the core. Moving onto a screen at a time you must shoot out anything and everything in your path, including lots of regenerating static targets. Realistic gravity takes effect, so you can't simply hover in a set position.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Elite Systems", "publishers": "Elite Systems", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.16", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airwolf_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMFgCjZABqg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/9962-airwolf\n"}
