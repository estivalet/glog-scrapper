{"altername_name": [], "name": "Trek Adventure", "overview": "Based on the original TV series. This one takes place aboard a familiar starship and is a must for Trekkies. The problem is a familiar one - the ship is in a \"decaying orbit\" (the Captain never could learn to park!) and the engines are out (you would think that in all those years, they would have learned to build some that didn't die once a week). Your options are to start the engine, save the ship, get off the ship, or die.
