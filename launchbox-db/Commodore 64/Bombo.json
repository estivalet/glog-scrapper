{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bombo", "overview": "In Bombo, you must jump about the screen using the joystick or keyboard, gathering all the tokens. If you are touched by one of the moving enemies, you lose a life. You only have three lives and if you lose all of them, the game is over. If you gather the tokens in the order they are flashing, you receive a bonus. If you grab the falling power up, you can then grab the enemies for points, for a time. It is a clone of the arcade game Bomb Jack, the official C64 port of which was released earlier the same year. The music in this one was composed by the late, great Ben Daglish.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ben Daglish", "publishers": "Rino Marketing", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.30", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombo_%28video_game%29", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjKVCWh6V-Q", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/89806-bombo\n"}
