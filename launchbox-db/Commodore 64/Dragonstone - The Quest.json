{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dragonstone: The Quest", "overview": "Welcome mighty adventurer, to the once great land of Astoria. So, you were drawn, as countless others did before you, by the tales of the fair Princess Lianna. Or did rumors of the fabulous Dragonstone - a magical, mystical gemstone of incredible size, beauty and worth, whet your appetite and bring you to this doom-laden realm? No matter... Your quest is to discover the whereabouts of the Dragonstone, rescue the beautiful Princess Lianna from the clutches of the evil Wizard Zaron, and, by destroying him, free Astoria from the pall of darkness that hangs over the once fair kingdom. On your way to the palace, to pledge fealty to the king, you see a black robed man, carrying a quarterstaff, beating a defenseless beggar. You intercede. The man in black reveals himself as Zaron, the black wizard of Astoria. He turns on you, and before you can stop him, casts a spell. You fall unconscious. When you awaken you discover that, as well as knocking you out, Zaron has transformed you into a lizard-man, and stolen your weapons and armour. The beggar helps you to a nearby Inn. You pay for a room and, after giving the beggar the last of your money for his help, you go upstairs to rest and make plans. After a while you come down to the bar. Fron now on, adventurer, it's up to you. Good luck. You'll need it.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1980", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Keith Evans", "publishers": "Alexander Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/97618-dragonstone-the-quest\n"}
