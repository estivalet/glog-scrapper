If you are unfamiliar with Crazy Eights it works like this: A card is played face up on the discard pile. You may play on it if you have. A card of the same suit or a card of the same value or an eight. In Eights for One you have two tableau piles where you can put cards that don't play. You must go through a full deck of cards (minus the eights) trying to get them all to play on the discard pile. There are five numbered piles; you press the number to select which card you want to move. Then you pres the number of the pile to move it to. Piles 1 and 2 are tableau piles. You may build up on these as you wish, any suit, any value. The top showing card is available to move to pile 4. 3 is the deck, the top card of the face-up deck is available to move to pile 1, 2 or 4. Pile 4 is the discard pile. Try to get all of the cards into this pile. You get more points if you don't use the eights but any card may play on an 8.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Maurice Jones", "publishers": "Softdisk Publishing", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/98078-eights-for-one\n"}
