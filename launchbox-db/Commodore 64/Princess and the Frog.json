{"altername_name": [], "name": "Princess and the Frog", "overview": "This take on Frogger features music and speech. In this variation, you are a frog trying to get to the princess's castle. You must first cross a road filled with jousting knights on horseback. You must then cross the moat, filled with snakes and alligators. The alligators will submerge, drowning your frog if he's riding on that alligator's back. If you make it safely, you become a handsome prince.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "PSI", "publishers": "Romox", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_UTSc8jRlw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/76049-princess-and-the-frog\n"}
