{"altername_name": [], "name": "Robo Form X", "overview": "This is a futuristic blaster, in which you control a robot, which has to save the world from enemy forces. There are several vicious boss attacks to battle your way through. There's even a cool remix of the original tune, Dance Nation, which VG Vox had originally stuck on the front end. I have supplied that one also, as well as the new build :) Have fun, and zap those baddies into oblivion.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "February 5, 2019", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Chris Yates", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmsC8qhHIsE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/129528-robo-form-x\n"}
