{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gravitrix", "overview": "GRAVITRIX brings arcade-style, mind-bending puzzle-action to your Commodore 64 like never seen before! Combine stones of four different gravity directions to solve each of the 120 levels across six themed worlds, but be wary of colour changers, conveyor belts, teleporters and other hazards! To complete each level, you must clear the screen of all of the coloured GRAVITRIX stones. ALL of the stones of EACH colour must be connected in a single 'group' in order for them to vanish, ie. you cannot have multiple, unconnected groups of the same colour in different areas of the screen. The big challenge in GRAVITRIX is that the stones don't just have different colours - they have different 'directions' (or gravity) as well! Each coloured stone 'falls' in its assigned direction (symbolised by an arrow) whenever there is nothing blocking its path, and this leads to some tricky chain reactions that must be solved. To make your life even harder there is also a time limit, environmental blocks and other gameplay elements that are introduced during the early levels. Supports both PAL and NTSC.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2014", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nils Hammerich", "publishers": "RGCD & Psytronik Software", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/117702-gravitrix\n"}
