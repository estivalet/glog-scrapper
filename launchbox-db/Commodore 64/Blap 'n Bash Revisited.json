{"altername_name": [], "name": "Blap 'n Bash Revisited", "overview": "Blap 'n Bash \u2013 Revisited, is a completely re-designed version of the original Blap 'n Bash game, which was released by The New Dimension in October 2015. This updated version was released on April 1, 2016. After the announcement in January 2016 of the 2015 16KB RGCD Game Cartridge continuing. I had just completed Vortex Crystals and submitted it to the compo. Heavy Stylus suggested that I should do a 16KB version of Blap 'n Bash. Rather than just submit a 16KB version of the previous build. I decided to give the game a complete overhaul. Blap 'n Bash Revisited features some BRAND NEW GRAPHICS, 16 NEW LEVELS and STUNNING NEW MUSIC and remixes of the old GET READY, GAME OVER and LEVEL COMPLETE jingles. The game also features the original in game TRANCE power up music and ENDING music. Other old features that stay are the animated stars and planets and a couple of other things.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "April 1, 2016", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Richard Bayliss", "publishers": "The New Dimension (TND)", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwpeMNoodBE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/124882-blap-n-bash-revisited\n"}
