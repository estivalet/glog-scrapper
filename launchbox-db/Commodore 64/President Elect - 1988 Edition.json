{"altername_name": [], "name": "President Elect: 1988 Edition", "overview": "A political simulation of the US presidential elections, President Elect allows you to simulate any campaign from the 60's to the upcoming (at the time) 1984 election as the campaign manager for any of the candidates featured in said elections. You can also create a custom candidate by completing an RPG-like character creation module and have him/her face off against actual politicians rated in a series of stats according to their political views and ideologies. Using a series of text-based menus you can run the campaign from labor day to the election night and allocate funds, agree to debates and perform other money-raising / PR stunts in hopes of conquering as many votes as possible.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ken Coates", "publishers": "Strategic Simulations", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "3", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Elect:_1988_Edition", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/121823-president-elect-1988-edition\n"}
