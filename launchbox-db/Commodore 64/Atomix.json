{"altername_name": [], "name": "Atomix", "overview": "Atomix is a puzzle game. On each level, you are given a couple of atoms, and your task is to arrange them into a specific molecule. You see all the atoms available for you to move in a top-down view. Down below on the left side is a small preview of what you must get. That picture represents a molecular structure that you must recreate by moving atoms horizontally and/or vertically. Once you move an atom, it won't stop unless it hits an obstacle, like a wall, or another atom, therefore you must use walls and other atoms creatively. The game contains 30 levels, and you have a limited time for each level.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Softouch Productions", "publishers": "Thalion Software", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomix_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl7UdzqlX2M", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/87627-atomix\n"}
