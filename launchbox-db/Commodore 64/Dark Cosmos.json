{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dark Cosmos", "overview": "A cooperative space-invaders style shooter for two simultaneous players. The game was created by Hannes Sommer from Klagenfurt, Austria and released in both 64'er 1991/03 and later in 64'er Sonderheft 79. In this space game, one or two players can maneuver their the dark universe. But suddenly you are faced with a wild attacker. He hides not only cowardly behind a protective galacto-wall. but also fires solar torpedoes. How fortunate that you have taken precautions and that your spaceship is equipped with a powerful laser. If, contrary to expectations, you succeed in shooting down all the torpedoes, you are by no means saved. No, because the wall is getting closer and your opponent fires another salvo off, but this time at a higher speed. Only after playing through and surviving four levels do you get a bonus level. If, on the other hand, everyone is gone, F1 or F2 starts the game again for one or two players. Have fun and good luck.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "March 1, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hannes Sommer", "publishers": "Markt & Technik", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164974-dark-cosmos\n"}
