{"altername_name": ["3D Glooper"], "name": "3-D Glooper", "overview": "3-D Glooper is a version of Pac-Man where you must move about a maze-like city eating blue blocks while trying to avoid the baddies called Gloopers that roam it. You can only escape once all the blocks are gone. Occasionally a red block will appear which for a short time allows you to eat the Gloopers. The game is viewed from a first person perspective. As well as the main playing area the number of lives, High Score, Score, and a timer can be seen at the top of the screen. Pressing F1 also brings up a map showing the location of any Gloopers and blue blocks left to eat at the top of the screen.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Atlantis Software Limited", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.84", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-ettCam2Ok", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/77515-3-d-glooper\n"}
