{"altername_name": [], "name": "Kamikaze", "overview": "In Kamikaze, the player flies their small plane toward the left edge of the level, shooting or avoiding other planes, as well as soldiers and missile launchers on the ground. The player also needs to look out for a certain plane carrying dynamite and shoot it down. Once the dynamite has been collected, the player makes their way toward the left edge of each level where they have to crash into the castle gate in order to rescue the hostages trapped inside. Another plane takes the place of the damaged one, and the players uses this plane to take the hostages back to base. The plane can only carry two hostages, so return trips to the castle are usually required. Once all hostages in the level have been returned to base, the player proceeds to the next level.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Digital Design", "publishers": "Codemasters", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmh-zIup2oo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/95956-kamikaze\n"}
