A logic puzzle where you need to match the setup on right by adding numbers on the left. Each space you click in will get a 1, if there are numbers next to it, all of them will be incremented up by one. So if you were to put a one next to they one you just created, it would become two! Determine how to best place your first tiles to have success in the end and a perfect comparison to the image on the right!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Andreas Steinmann", "publishers": "Markt & Technik", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/91132-compare\n"}
