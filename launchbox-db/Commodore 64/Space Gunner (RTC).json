{"altername_name": [], "name": "Space Gunner (RTC)", "overview": "A pretty well done crosshairs shooter with faux vector line graphics. Space Gunner is an exciting video arcade-type game for the Commodore-64 with the object being to defend the planet Namcap against the fleet of the Warlords of Zorlon. The screen shows the display from inside the cockpit of an attack ship. The joystick is used to aim the gunsight and fire to destroy the approaching Zorlons. The control panel at the bottom of the screen gives continuous readouts of both fuel and scores. As the player's ship absorbs energy from exploding Zorlon ships, the fuel count rises. The level of difficulty increases and the game progresses.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mark Robinson", "publishers": "RTC", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3GhMOA3afw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/129264-space-gunner-rtc\n"}
