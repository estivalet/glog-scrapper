{"altername_name": [], "name": "Trance Sector", "overview": "Signals from a distant, unnamed planet have been intercepted by Planet Earth. These have revealed details of an intergalactic threat from a race that call themselves the Cygma Elite. A strike team has been mobilised and sent to explore the planet to find out more about the alien threat. The team discovered that the Cygma Elite have built a series of factories that are producing radioactive nuclear pods. These deadly pods have been stored in a huge 32 storey facility called the TRANCE SECTOR. Reports from our team indicate the Cygma Elite are planning to use the pods stored in the TRANCE SECTOR to build the Cygma Armageddon Bomb - a huge bomb that poses a risk not only to Earth, but to the entire solar system! Your mission: Enter the TRANCE SECTOR, collect the nuclear pods from each of the 32 levels - this will cause a cascade reaction that will destroy the facility - before it destroys US!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2012", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Richard Bayliss", "publishers": "RGCD & Psytronik Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7hBL-FpJGw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/114006-trance-sector\n"}
