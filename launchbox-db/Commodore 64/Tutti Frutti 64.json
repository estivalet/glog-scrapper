Tutti Frutti is based on the arcade game Mr. Do! where you play Super Strawberry, The King of the Orchard who must collect all the ripe cherries. Trying to stop you are the Acid Apple Gang who wander around the orchard and one touch from them loses one of five lives but you can fire at them to kill them. Walking through the dirt creates a path which the Gang can walk on but they can't walk through the dirt themselves. Be careful walking under apples as well as you have a very short time before it falls on top of you. Collect all the cherries on the level and you move to the next one. The whole level is shown on one screen and as well as the main playing area you can also see your score, time, Bonus, lives, level and a high score table.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "December 31, 2014", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jan R\u00f6dig", "publishers": "Commodore Format", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUa0viRVhwc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/131815-tutti-frutti-64\n"}
