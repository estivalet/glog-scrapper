{"altername_name": [], "name": "Kermit's Electronic Storymaker", "overview": "A video game/book set that was made for the Commodore 64 and Apple II in 1984. In the game, the player puts together a story using the words in the book. The player's choices then come to life as an animated story. The Muppets of the television show -- Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, Gonzo, the whole gang -- act out sentences that the child at the computer console constructs, using the program's vocabulary. No matter how ridiculous, if it's grammatically correct, they'll oblige.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sierra On-Line", "publishers": "Walt Disney Computer Software", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ByQ9jwaLNw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109115-kermits-electronic-storymaker\n"}
