{"altername_name": [], "name": "Back to the Future Part III", "overview": "Back to the Future III is a collection of four arcade games. Marty McFly and Doc Brown have traveled back through time to the year 1885 - and they're soon deep in trouble when they face \"Mad Dog\" Tannen's gang and have to find a way to return to the present. This game takes four scenes from the Hollywood movie Back to the Future III and turns them into arcade sequences: \u2022Buckboard Chase: Doc Brown goes horseback in an attempt to save Hill Valley's lovely school teacher Clara. This game of quick ducking, jumping and shooting alternates between a side-scrolling and a top-down perspective. \u2022Shooting Gallery: The name says it all. A classic game of aim-and-shoot, spiced up by hidden extras and bonus targets. \u2022Pie Throwing: Meet the Mad Dog gang. They have guns, and you have... cream pies. It's an isometric version of the shooting gallery, only with ammo. And the targets shoot back. \u2022The Train: Basically a side-scrolling beat-em-up on train wagons with some ducking and jumping. Get rid of the mechanics and collect speed logs to push the engine to a magic 88 mph.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "July 15, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Probe Software", "publishers": "Image Works", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.9", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_to_the_Future_Part_III_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofXvhr2KT2k", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6402-back-to-the-future-part-iii\n"}
