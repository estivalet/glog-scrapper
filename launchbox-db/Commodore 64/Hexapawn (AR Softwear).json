{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hexapawn (AR Softwear)", "overview": "There are four games named Hexapawn for the Commodore 64, which should be no surprise as it is based and named after a chess variant played with pawns on a small portion of the chess board. In this version by AR Softwear, Hexapawn is played with chess pawns on a 3x3 board. Your pawns are white. To win, move one of your pieces to the opponent's side of the board first, capture all of the opponent's pieces, or block him from making any move. The computer starts a series of games knowing only how to move and how to recognize a win. It has no initial strategy, but it keeps a record of all bad moves and improves its strategy until it becomes invincible", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "A.R.
