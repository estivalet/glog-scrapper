{"altername_name": ["Zap Fight 2"], "name": "Zap Fight II: Zapped to Oblivion", "overview": "Glorious news this Sunday evening, especially you are a fan of shoot em ups, as Psytronik Software and Reset Magazine Staff have released the latest frantic shooter for the C64 ' Zap Fight 2 'aka 'Zapped to Oblivion!' Featuring the graphics of Alf Yngve, code by Martin Piper and music by Richard, this rather eye opening shoot em up is inspired by the classic game Slap Fight and features lots of blasting action and plenty of power ups to keep you busy. Zap Fight 2 is a stunning sequel to the original Zap Fight, which was originally released on Psytronik Software's third Shoot Em Up Destruction Set. This game was originally intended to be released on the Shoot Em Up Destruction Set 4, but a different futuristic blaster was already on top of the list for the compilation. Plus there were enough games for the compilation. So we submitted this game for the Reset Mix-I-Disk, and also TND contributor's page. The alien empire from Planet XTro has launched an attack on planet Earth (Like they always did in this type of scenario). Enter a fearless fighter pilot, to defend the home planet - Erm, that is you in fact :) ... Battle through enemy ridden landscapes and make a real mess out of the alien scum. Pick up power stars to gain power ups. Avoid shooting our medi-ships, or we will trigger a self destruct device on your ship. - Save our beloved planet!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2017", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Alf Yngve", "publishers": "Psytronik Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHP0USHaFBo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/132293-zap-fight-ii-zapped-to-oblivion\n"}
