{"altername_name": [], "name": "Snowdown", "overview": "Another re-skinned game of the well-received Showdown for the Commodore 64. They took good care to make it ready for the Holiday season with amazing graphics. In the game, you play a Santa out to win a fierce gun duel. The first one to outwit and knock down the opponent 5 times is the winner of the duel. It can be played by 1 or 2 players. Giddy-up and get ready to fight! Each canon can carry 5 snowballs. You reload by manually replacing the snowballs with a click of the joystick button, or you can pick up snowball packs from the ground. But beware! If your opponent catches you out of the safety of the snowmen, then you might get knocked down! Explosive crates appear around the play area. They explode when shot, so better stay away from them if you value you life, cowboy! The game was initially a purchase only digital release, it was however, made free on December 4, 2021.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "December 1, 2020", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Badgerpunch Games", "publishers": "itch.io", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvgvg1Ju5lw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/146608-snowdown\n"}
