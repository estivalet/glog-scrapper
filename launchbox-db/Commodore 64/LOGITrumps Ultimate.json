{"altername_name": ["August 8, 2020"], "name": "LOGITrumps Ultimate", "overview": "Logitrumps is a card game, like we used to play it in the 80's similar to the card game \"War\". Each player (you and the computer) gets the same number of cards. Each card represents a retro computer and has several values like Year, memory, colors, RAM, etc. Each card has strength and weaknesses. If a computer has a lot of memory or colors, it usually isn't that old and therefor would likely lose in the year category. Usually the higher value wins with the exception of the year where the lower value wins. The player to win all the cards through strategic match-ups wins the game.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "August 8, 2020", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Logiker", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7OvDJAThlk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/149555-logitrumps-ultimate\n"}
