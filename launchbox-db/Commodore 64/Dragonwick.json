{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dragonwick", "overview": "Collect as much gold as you can before the dragon and other foes catch you. Created by James C. Hilty and published in Loadstar #045 in 1987. There is no peace in Camelot. Ever since the evil overlord Dragonwick came to town, bullying the wimpish townspeople into giving him tribute, there has been little laughter and even less joy. But now that you, the good Prince James, have come back from your visit to Camp David, the people have been exhorting you to recover the bags of gold that Dragonwick extorted from them. Exciting work, however exhausting and exacting it may be. The castle consists of three sticky-walled rooms, which may explain Dragonwick's generally foul Mood, and he's secreted four bags of gold in each room. To protect this gold he's left some of his buddies in each room. Bats, dragons and even Malevolent pumpkins will try to thwart you as you go for the gold. There are an unlimited number of levels to the castle. After the fifth room you enter the part of the castle where Dragonwick has ingeniously electrified the walls. They kill, but at least they aren't sticky any more. You may never encounter Dragonwick himself but you may rest assured that if you can beat the high Score your name will go down in his Hall of Fame.
