{"altername_name": [], "name": "Fairlight", "overview": "\"The land of Fairlight no longer lives up to its name, its culture and society having declined over centuries. The former ruler's castle Avars is shrouded in mystery, and Isvar chooses to investigate it. Unfortunately, he finds himself trapped in a mysterious castle from which he must escape. Viewed isometrically, Isvar's adventure features complex object manipulation: each object has its own physical properties and resultant characteristics in terms of how much else can be carried alongside it. The castle is guarded and full of trolls, who can weaken Isvar's energy - food and wine can restore it.\" --mobygames.com", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bo Jangeborg", "publishers": "The Edge", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairlight_%28video_game%29", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swYBSHtuhGY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27325-fairlight\n"}
