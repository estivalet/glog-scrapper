{"altername_name": [], "name": "Interlox", "overview": "Interlox is a simple, yet effective game based on the old children's favorite, Noughts & Crosses/Tic-Tac-Toe. It differs from that game only in the fact that it is played not on one 3x3 square, but on 4-interlocking squares simultaneously. Interlox may be played by one player against the computer, or by two players against each other. For convenience, the board is laid out in the same format as the C64 keyboard; each position on the board is selected by hitting the appropriate key. One Player Game: The player must make as many lines of three counters as possible, horizontal, vertical, or diagonal, withine any of the four squares. At the same time, he, or she must prevent the C64 from making a line. Two Player Game: Each player takes it in turn to place their counters on the board. The winner is the one with the highest score when the board is full. The game was developed by Australian coder, Barry \"Cout Games\" Hart and released into the public domain in 2018. The game is also an unofficial conversion of an old type-in game for the Commodore VIC-20.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2018", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Cout Games", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTvh9nqByGY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165119-interlox\n"}
