{"altername_name": [], "name": "Village", "overview": "A strategy game created by Vince Apps and published in 1984 in the book \"40 Educational Games for the Commodore 64\". In it, you have just been appointed the chief of a village of natives whose lives depend on their crops of wheat. If you manage the crops properly then the village will prosper and the population will increase but should you make a mistake then people will starve, people will die and you will be attacked by an angry mob. By the way, your people need about two and a half bags of wheat each to survive for a year. Give them less and they starve and they won't like that. If you give them 5 bags each they will be pleased and may forgive you for past mistakes. Look out as well for the rats which always attack your crops in the warehouse. The more you store, the greater will be the losses from rats. The screen will show you that you are in your first year as leader. You will begin with a certain population and a certain amount of wheat. There are symbols for people and sacks of wheat and each symbol represents ten units. The computer will ask you how much of your wheat you wish to sow. Remember to keep some back as it might be a bad harvest. The computer will then tell you how much wheat you have grown and you will be asked how much you wish to give your people. Try and survive ten years as leader", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Vince Apps", "publishers": "Granada Publishing Ltd.", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/155951-village\n"}
