{"altername_name": [], "name": "Orion Quest", "overview": "Earth's war with the planet Zarp has been raging for many years and now in the year 2554, the Zarps have one last plan to end the war, once and for all. They have planted a huge bomb which will destroy the whole of Earth, and Zarp have threatened to detonate it unless Earth give in to their demands. Missions have failed to try to land on Zarp to retrieve the data needed to disarm the bomb and you are now the last mission and last hope for the planet. Problems have arisen from the start of the mission as you attempted to land you were shot, and although you survived the crash, you are now on this hostile planet with no way to leave the planet if you do get the data needed. Orion Quest is a graphic text adventure where the screen has a picture showing your surroundings and text describes what you can see. You type in commands with the keyboard to interact with each location.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dave C.
