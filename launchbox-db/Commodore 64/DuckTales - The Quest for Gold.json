{"altername_name": [], "name": "DuckTales: The Quest for Gold", "overview": "They say money doesn\u2019t buy happiness, but perhaps someone should tell that to Scrooge McDuck and his cousin, Flintheart Glomgold. They\u2019re the stars of a quacking (sorry) new game from those masters of animation, Disney. To old Scrooge and his equally tight cousin Flintheart, money is everything. Put simply, they\u2019re the kind of characters who would sell their grandmothers if they thought an easy profit could be made. And to prove how financially astute they really are, a challenge has been set \u2013 whoever collects the most money in under 30 days wins the coveted title of \u2018Duck Of The Year\u2019 in that illustrious publication, Dime Magazine. So the scene is set. Duck against Duck in a battle where everything goes (for the right price, that is). You play the part of old Scrooge McDuck \u2013 a bad egg on the outside, but a nice old chap in the inside. With the aid of his nephews Hue, Dewey and Louie, old McDuck must grab his Indiana Jones hat and whip and go in search of treasure. He\u2019ll find himself lost in a network of caves, swinging from vines in the Amazon Jungle and climbing mountains in search of treasure. Each of these little excursions takes the form of a separate sub game which has to be completed if McDuck is to add to his already bulging coffers.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Incredible Technologies", "publishers": "Titus", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.11", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DuckTales:_The_Quest_for_Gold", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuWbjy7lF2w", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/87319-ducktales-the-quest-for-gold\n"}
