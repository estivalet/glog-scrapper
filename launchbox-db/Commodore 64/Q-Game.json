{"altername_name": ["QGame"], "name": "Q-Game", "overview": "An unofficial C64 port of Sony Ericsson's 'Q' a puzzle game featured on the T68i mobile phone. It features a level password and continue from the last puzzle completed and some nice graphics. Your goal in the game being to manoeuvre the coloured balls around each level and drop them into the appropriate matching pockets. The balls can be selected by the cursor and rolled in the direction of your choice (using a joystick plugged into port 2 - emulated or otherwise), but as movement is only stopped by walls or other obstructions you'll need to plan ahead to successfully get them all lined up. Don't be fooled by the simple game-play though, Q Game is a devious little puzzler that will require a logical mind of Mensa calibre to complete all 60 levels.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2007", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Alberto Manconi", "publishers": "Papposoft", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CqegDCktHg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/166430-q-game\n"}
