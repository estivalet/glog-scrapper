{"altername_name": ["Commando Arcade: Special Edition"], "name": "Commando Arcade SE", "overview": "Completely new graphics! Here's a top quality release for you C64 owners as the C64 group Nostalgia has just released 'Commando Arcade SE, which is a special edition of their previous 2014 Commando Arcade remake of the classic game from the original way back in the early 80's. Although Commando was a great game on the C64, it could've been so much better, and thanks to Nostalgia they set out to re-release it as a faithful version to the Arcade and featured more levels, new level features, new graphics, a new scroller and much much more. But this version goes even further! I thought the Commando Arcade release was the best 8-bit version of Commando by far, but with the new version released today I was proven wrong. Commando Arcade SE \"IS\" the best version so far, A run and gun shoot em up that has lasted the ages has just got far far better and has pushed the boundary of greatness:", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "March 21, 2015", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Chris Butler", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9XKClATRNo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/132159-commando-arcade-se\n"}
