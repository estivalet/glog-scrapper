The regression techniques used by The Hypnotist are based on the neural linguistic patterns used by world-famous medical hypnotist Milton H. Erikson, M.D. These patters are very subtle, almost undetectable to the nonprofessional. You will barely realize the effects until you begin to recall the past or project yourself into your own future. Hypnosis and trance induction is achieved by strobing at the specific frequency require to bring on a trance. It claimed to be able to induce super learning and other strange mental states as part of the overall game and was released by Psycom Software International in 1983.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Psycom Software International", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jahIHEw-EE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165467-the-hypnotist\n"}
