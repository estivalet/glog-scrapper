{"altername_name": [], "name": "Zzapped in the Butt: Deluxe", "overview": "Back in the spring of 2020 The New Dimension worked on a 4K compo entry for Reset's Craptastic 2020. This was to be an arcade shoot 'em up game called \"Zzapped in the Butt\" but 4K had its own limitations. 6 months later, the game finally gets released as a full production. Zzapped in the Butt - Deluxe is a fast paced shoot 'em up. Game description: A pink mother ship has approached the surface of Planet Earth. The Earthlings fire up a force-field to keep the blighter out. Unfortunately however, the mother ship has other ideas. It beams out aliens at random positions underneath the force-field. Now they are heading towards your territory. It is your job to defend your territory from the aliens. This can be done by controlling your fighter jet using a joystick in port 2 (or emulating it). Blasting the aliens may be the easy part - but with the mother-ship charging itself up and firing lasers where you are positioned. It will make your mission much harder. At the end of the day you don't want to get Zzapped in the Butt. You will complete each level after all of the aliens have finished beaming down. For all 4 of your territory rescued, extra lives will be rewarded.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "December 25, 2020", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Richard Bayliss", "publishers": "The New Dimension (TND)", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4uBLsN66Q", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/146626-zzapped-in-the-butt-deluxe\n"}
