{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Toy Shop", "overview": "Here's an unusual one: The Toy Shop is a set of computerized patterns for building your own mechanical models. You use the software to print out the pieces, then assemble them according to a set of instructions that come with the software. There are 20 different models, including trucks and cars with wheels that turn, a crane, an oil pump, a balloon-powered locomotive, a penny-powered clockwork bank, a helicopter powered by a rubber band, a sundial, a carousel, and the Spirit of St. Louis airplane with a working propeller. Designs can be printed on regular computer paper, then glued to card stock, cut out, and assembled.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Active Arts", "publishers": "Br\u00f8derbund Software", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133737-the-toy-shop\n"}
