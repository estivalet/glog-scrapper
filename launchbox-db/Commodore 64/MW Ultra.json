{"altername_name": ["Metal Warrior Ultra"], "name": "MW Ultra", "overview": "MW ULTRA is a reinterpretation of the original Metal Warrior game released in 1999 that sees you take control of Ian as he unravels a conspiracy taking place around him and inside his mind. Ian will have to use his wits and his skills to survive against street gangs, highly trained soldiers, wild animals, robot drones and much more as you navigate your way though many different environments in order to uncover the truth to who he really is. MW ULTRA is a great title that features interactive action adventure gameplay all within the confines of an engrossing story environment. In asking him what inspired him to reboot the Metal Warrior Series after its long hiatus, Lasse reveals: \u201cEach of the original MW games had been made in an ad-hoc manner based on the ideas I had at the moment, both for story and gameplay. Combined with that I was still only learning programming, game design and storytelling, particularly with the first game, this left the feeling that things could have been done better.\u201d Indeed it is perhaps a little known fact that Lasse experimented to reboot the franchise for the Game Boy Advance and PC but these turned out to be failed attempts that fizzled out to nothing. It wasn\u2019t until a co-worker (Marja Kuipers) began writing fan fiction based on Lasse\u2019s trilogy of novels that featured Metal Warrior characters that firmly planted the seed that a reboot of the series would be warranted in an expanded story setting.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "August 4, 2020", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Covert Bitops", "publishers": "Protovision", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHF7LKL77w8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/153523-mw-ultra\n"}
