{"altername_name": ["Loop"], "name": "Super Scoop", "overview": "An arcade style collect'em up game. The Pennysland thermonuclear power plant was attacked by a group of rebels who want to bring the government forces to their knees, depriving the whole region of vital energy. The rebels then sabotaged some power lines to prevent the power plant from coming back into operation. Moving with your vehicle, hanging from the energy grid, you must attempt to restore all damaged contacts, but beware your enemies are lurking and will try to attack you to prevent you from completing your task. If you have finished one sector you will be able to move on to the next one, but it appears to be a little more difficult.
