{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sequel", "overview": "A logic puzzle game created by Oliver Gaspirtz and published in 64'er 1992/03. Anyone who loves Sarakon will surely become addicted to this game as well. The clone of the well-known puzzle hit offers beautiful graphics and crisp sounds. Two of the same symbols must always be selected, whereby the connecting line between the two selected stones may not bend more than twice. When clearing the individual levels, the player should not hesitate too much, because the time limit expires in a flash and you are back at the starting point and can start the procedure again from the beginning. A password query does not exist. But after some practice, you move the mouse hand briskly over the screen and clearing the levels becomes addictive. So have fun puzzling and playing quick fingers on the joystick. And don't forget: Sequel logic required!", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Oliver Gaspirtz", "publishers": "Markt & Technik", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/126941-sequel\n"}
