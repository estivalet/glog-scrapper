{"altername_name": [], "name": "Robot Run", "overview": "A Berzerk inspired shooter. Take down the robots before they exterminate you! Like in Berserk, there is an invincible \"boss\" you must escape. However, the game differs from Berzerk in the fact that the enemy robots can shoot diagonally, which makes for a slightly harder game than your standard Berzerk clone.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jay McIntosh", "publishers": "NET Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ztAb40yyg8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/126219-robot-run\n"}
