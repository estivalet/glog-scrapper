{"altername_name": [], "name": "Super Silverfish", "overview": "A glorious Silverfish sequel created with the 2016 version of the Shoot'em Up Construction Kit (SEUCK Redux) and published in the Reset #09.5 Mix-i-Disk. A new war has broken out. A terrorist has just built a giant offensive weapon to take over the world. He threatens to use it on different parts of the world. It is time for operation Super Silverfish. Your mission is to guide your military based helicopter across enemy lines in 5 different areas, and locate the giant offensive weapon in the final desert strike and destroy it. Fight against the offensive militants, by land, sea or by air. Watch out because these baddies are armed with powerful aiming devices. Luckily for you however, help is at hand. The team involved in operation Super Silverfish will help you, by supplying power up balloons or parachutes. Should you collect one of these, it will arm your helicopter with something else. If you lose a helicopter, the power up will be lost. Can you help save the World from a threat of DESTRUCTION from the giant offensive weapon?. Good luck pilot. You will need it. Like the original Silverfish, Super Silverfish is heavily inspired by the arcade game, Silkworm.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "December 25, 2016", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Alf Yngve", "publishers": "Psytronik Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUpQwpDWyB8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/131122-super-silverfish\n"}
