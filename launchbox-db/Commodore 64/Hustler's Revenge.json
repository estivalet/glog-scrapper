{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hustler's Revenge", "overview": "Hustler's Revenge is a top-view single screen game for two players, played on a table with four pockets in each corner. On the table are the players balls (white or black) either side of a red ball, and the aim is to be the first player to reach 50 points by potting the red ball. Potting the red ball is worth two points but there are other ways to score and they are potting the opponents ball after the red ball is potted (two points), hitting the red ball after hitting the other players ball (one point), or receiving a point if the other player pots their ball. The ball can be moved around the table but inertia of the ball must be taken into consideration. After a ball has been potted, it takes five seconds to re-appear on the table.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "H.M.C.N.", "publishers": "Laing Marketing", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/105931-hustlers-revenge\n"}
