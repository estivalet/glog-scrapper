Armed with a pistol, the player has to kill various thugs, before the timer runs out. While the game has several levels, the background in the game does not change often. The other half of the game is a driving sequence, similar to other computer games such as Roadblasters.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "July 1, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gray Matter", "publishers": "Gremlin Graphics Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BS56QqE5fvQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6251-techno-cop\n"}
