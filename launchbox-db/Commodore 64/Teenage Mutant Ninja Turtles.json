{"altername_name": ["Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles"], "name": "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles", "overview": "Fresh from the classic comics come heroes in a half shell! Obsessed by revenge, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are out to rescue lovely April O\u2019Neil, who\u2019s been captured by SHREDDER-a maniac more menacing than an army of mind altered Bruce Lees. But if they\u2019re to succeed, you must command the role of each turtle (one at a time, of course), rumbling through six New York territories patrolled by Ninjitsu Warriors, blood descendants of the deadly Foot Clan. Along the way you\u2019ll encounter Mouser infested sewers, criminally polluted rivers and villainous streets run by the terrorist team of Bebop and Rocksteady. To overcome these inhumane hazards, utilize your reptilian brain and map out strategies that will help you locate secret sewage passages. Also be sure to alternate your turtle identity throughout the mission, matching each turtle\u2019s strengths with those of the ever changing enemy. So grab your nunchukus and prepare to put yourself in someone else\u2019s shell. Because in this to-the-death adventure, you\u2019ll control every leap, chop, slice and dice, until you knock heads with Shredder and either splatter him senseless or get yourself turned into turtle soup.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Unlimited Software", "publishers": "ImageWorks", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.42", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_(NES_video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiIKUFjw6KA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/57129-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles\n"}
