{"altername_name": [], "name": "Headache", "overview": "Ned is trapped inside the human Head, and his job is to wait for the nerve centers to indicate when an impulse is ready. When one is, he has to collect the impulse and carry it to the brain. If an impulse originates from the brain, Ned must carry it to the neck. There are two types of enemies Ned must watch out for. The throbs, which appear in various disguises, spill down from the brain and run around the head, and they can be avoided or atomized. Occasionally, Head Banger appears from the neck and makes his way up to the brain, and he must be stopped at all costs to avoid a major headache. If Ned survives long enough, he will return to a clear Head.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "The Software Shed", "publishers": "Firebird Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvjzIGqQfh0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/96667-headache\n"}
