{"altername_name": ["Invest"], "name": "Inve$t", "overview": "Big Business, stripped down to the bare essentials: Make lots of money in this turn-based management simulation by buying companies and selling the goods they produce. Invest is all about, well, investment - fresh cash flows directly into new businesses, new shares and new company improvements in a never-ending cycle of productivity. Up to four human players can compete for market dominance; the computer takes vacant places. Whoever amasses the most money or builds a monopoly in one of the six business areas (from pharmaceuticals to space engineering) wins. Tension rises as hired saboteurs and spies infiltrate companies to cause maximum damage - unless they are caught by a detective on guard. Invest is a German game and was never published in any other language.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Marcel Siegert", "publishers": "Starbyte Software", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106612-invet\n"}
