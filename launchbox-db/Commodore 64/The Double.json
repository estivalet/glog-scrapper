{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Double", "overview": "The Double is a football management simulator based on the English Football League and includes all the four top divisions from the 80s. The idea of the game is to manage a team from the bottom division and take them all the way to the top division and win 'The Double', which consists of winning the League and The FA Cup in the same season. At the start of the game you are presented with a team and a contract for you to agree with. After agreeing terms you are then taken to various menus which allow you to manage your team. All the usual options are there from team selection, transfers, scouting reports, finances, ground improvements and various other options to improve your team. After you are happy with your selections you are then taken to the actual game. Here you can watch your game, see just the results or watch another game. You watch the game from an elevated side view showing part of the pitch. After the result, win, draw or lose you then use the menus to once again improve your team and take them to the top.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Paul Barnard", "publishers": "Johnson Scanatron Ltd.", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75477-the-double\n"}
