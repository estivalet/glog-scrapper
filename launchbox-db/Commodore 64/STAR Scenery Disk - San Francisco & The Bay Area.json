{"altername_name": ["Flight Simulator II: STAR Scenery Disk: San Francisco"], "name": "STAR Scenery Disk: San Francisco & The Bay Area", "overview": "STAR Scenery Disk: San Francisco Area is a scenery add-on for subLOGIC Flight Simulator II, Microsoft Flight Simulator 1.0 and 2.x. It covers the area of San Francisco in great detail through providing a higher amount of buildings, landmarks and more detailed display of airport layouts. Additionally, an optional fog layer can be turned on, which is not available in other Scenery Disks or in the standard Flight Simulator software. STAR Scenery Disks such as this one allow the pilot to experience an enhancement of the flying environment through added airports, landmarks, visual details and navaids. They are derived using National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Sectional Aeronautical Charts and Airport/Facility Directories. Scenery Disks can also be used with subLOGIC UFO, Jet simulator and Stealth Mission.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Sublogic", "publishers": "Sublogic", "genres": "Flight Simulator", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/130955-star-scenery-disk-san-francisco-the-bay-area\n"}
