{"altername_name": [], "name": "Breakout (Phoenix Publishing Associates)", "overview": "From the book \"The Commodore 64 Program Book\". This game should be a pushover for those amongst you who have spent too many hours in arcades playing with the machines. Across the top of the screen are five rows of coloured bricks, and the objective is to demolish this mutlicoloured prison by bouncing a ball off the bricks. Clear the wall and a new screenful will be generated. Use keys O and P to control your bats, but remember that you will have to predict the trajectory of the ball as it returns to you.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Vince Apps", "publishers": "Phoenix Publishing Associates", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90129-breakout-phoenix-publishing-associates\n"}
