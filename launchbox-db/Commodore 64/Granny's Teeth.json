Granny's Teeth has finally become a full game. Released now :) This game works on PAL and NTSC machines and is also fully compatible with theC64 mini/full size computer. Poor old Granny Hegarty. She was looking after her grandchildren until it was bed time. She gently tucked them in to bed, and went to bed herself - dropping the false teeth into a glass by her bed side. Alas, the next morning comes by. Granny wakes up and finds that her teeth are missing. It turns out that the children got up early and played hide and seek with them and chucked the teeth in to a fish bowl. The kids also ransacked Granny's house. Raffles the dog has been set loose, and Tiddles, the cat is on the prowl. ... and who let that toy plane, spider and giant wasp in to the house? Also little did Granny know was that her house was built above a swimming pool. Your task is to help poor old Granny retrieve her teeth by locating them from the fish bowl. Watch out for the animals and insects, and other hazards. If you hit any hazards, you will lose a life and be thrown back to the start of each level.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2016", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Richard Bayliss", "publishers": "", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/160289-grannys-teeth\n"}
