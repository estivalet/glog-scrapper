{"altername_name": [], "name": "Snertle", "overview": "Snertle is a math game for kids that involves a cute little turtle. It was developed by Soori Sivakumaran and published in COMPUTE! 1984/05 (Issue #48). \"Snertle\" is designed to help teacli cliildren the fundamentals of addition, subtraction, and multiplication. A turtle named Snertle is drawn on the screen to give encouragement and assistance to the player. Snertle allows children to tailor math problems to fit their individual abilities and weaknesses. Snertle first asks the child to select addition, sub- traction, or multiplication problems. If addition or subtraction is selected, the child is then asked to choose the largest and smallest numbers to be used in creating the problems. The largest number that can be chosen is 99 and the smallest number is zero. If multiplication is chosen, the child can de- cide to practice a certain \"times table,\" or solve problems created randomly from through the 14 times table. For example, if the 12 times table is selected, then one number in each question created will always be 12. The other number will be randomly selected from the range 0-14. If the child chooses to attempt random multi- plication problems, he or she must define the range of numbers (within the limits of and 14) from which the problems can be created, similar to the process for random addition or subtraction problems.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Soori Sivakumaran", "publishers": "COMPUTE!
