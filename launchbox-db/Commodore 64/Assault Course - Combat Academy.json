{"altername_name": [], "name": "Assault Course: Combat Academy", "overview": "No one ever told you life in the army would be easy. The Assault Course Combat Academy is probably the most challenging and realistic combat training simulator. You'll experience real pain as you are forced up against a range of gruelling obstacles, water jumps, razor-wire, monkey bars, the log challenge, twelve foot walls and the rope swing. If you fail you'll be peeling spuds in the mess tent for the next three weeks, so polish your boots, put on your best fatigues and kick some mud.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "August 20, 1990", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Wow Software", "publishers": "Players Premier", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/32094-assault-course-combat-academy\n"}
