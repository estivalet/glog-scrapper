{"altername_name": [], "name": "Galaxions", "overview": "The earth is being invaded by an alien force. The Galaxions have arrived from a living planet, determined to destroy civilization as we know it. They came in formation, swooping and diving towards the planet Earth. You and you alone can save mankind from the terrifying destruction the aliens threaten us with. As you destroy each fleet, another fleet arrives even more deadly than the previous one. Galaxions is based on the arcade game Galaxian where you control a spacecraft at the bottom of the screen, moving left or right, to destroy alien invaders above. The aliens sit in a formation and move across the screen left to right and back again dropping bombs to destroy you. Occasionally a couple of aliens will break from formation and swoop down and when they move off the bottom of the screen they appear at the top again. If you are hit by an alien or a bomb then you lose one of three lives and once you destroy all the aliens then they appear again in formation.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "John P.
