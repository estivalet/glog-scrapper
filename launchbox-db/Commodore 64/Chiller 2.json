{"altername_name": [], "name": "Chiller 2", "overview": "Chiller 2 by Cosine Systems is a multi-level single-screen platform game inspired by the Mastertronic game Chiller. The aim of the game is to collect 20 crosses on each level while avoiding all sorts of nasty ghouls, witches, and critters that drain your energy when you make contact with them. While you\u2019re at it, make sure you also look out for where you stand as each level is littered with poisonous mushrooms that will also result in a loss of energy. There are 12 challenging creepy levels for you to complete so I hope you are not afraid of the dark.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "December 16, 2020", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Andy Vaisey", "publishers": "Cosine Systems", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBvt6WrODkk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/159758-chiller-2\n"}
