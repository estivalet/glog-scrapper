{"altername_name": [], "name": "Viz: The Game", "overview": "Viz: The Game is an action game where the players run through various scrolling environments. It is based on a British comic magazine VIZ which, like the game, features lots of crude humour and fart jokes. The player controls one of the 3 Viz characters - Johnny Fartpants, Buster Gonad, or Biffa Bacon. The race takes place in five different scrolling environments; country, town, building site, beach and a disco. During the race you have to dodge traps and other characters from the VIZ comics. There are also two mini-games for each character which include Pint Drinking, blowing up balloons with farts and Pancake Flattening. Viz: The Computer Game (also known in-game as \"Viz: The Soft Floppy One\" and \"Viz: The Game\" on the box cover) is a single player racing game based on the Viz adult comic which was released in 1991 by Virgin Interactive. The game's lively music was composed by Jeroen Tel.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Probe Software", "publishers": "Future Publishing", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viz:_The_Game", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Oz6X0rAObs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/96920-viz-the-game\n"}
