{"altername_name": ["Western Fighter", "Attacco al Treno"], "name": "Outlaw (Palace Software)", "overview": "A western themed shoot'em up included as one of the samples of the Shoot-'Em-Up Construction Kit. The adventure is set in the old Far West at the time of pioneers and sees two unscrupulous outlaws as protagonists. These bandits have to find safety by escaping to Mexico and to reach it they have to go through many areas full of dangers. These dangers are represented by the Native Americans of their territory, by the inhabitants of a town on the border of Arizona, by soldiers hunting for bandits by animals such as snakes, bison, etc. and by natural phenomena such as the winds and elements. To survive, our friends must carefully avoid the various bullets thrown at them, the animals and objects that the wind tosses in the duo's direction. To defend themselves from enemies, they can shoot with their trusty Colt sidearms. If you have a friend you can play both characters on the screen at the same time. While this was included in the Shoot-'Em-Up Construction Kit, it was released as a standalone game in Italy as Gina e Paolo in Special C64 n.3 (1991/1992) and as Attacco al Treno in COM 64 n.61 (gennaio/febbraio 1993).", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Albert Pluns", "publishers": "Arcadia", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15m1W88JXhA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/123325-outlaw-palace-software\n"}
