{"altername_name": [], "name": "Imperium: Der Auftrag", "overview": "A German language science fiction RPG game. The aim was to guide a party of 4 characters through a mission, which was divided into three levels. The screen arrangement was as in Ultima. There were lots of sounds and little graphics and lots of features mentioned. The aim of the game is to reactivate a central computer console in the space city, the Triton 5 gas mine colony. Initially, however, the player and three companions are on board a cargo cruiser and must first ensure that the ship is in place. Achieved objective and landed on the colony. After possibly stocking up on some gear, you might want to consider leaving the ship and getting what you need in the colony, eventually stepping in front of the central computer console. From time to time it may seem convenient to contact the Ministry of Internal Affairs on Drabamp and get some assistance from them, but other than that the player is on their own.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "J\u00f6rg Schliesser", "publishers": "Tronic Verlag GmbH", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KpUQ9jEva8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165654-imperium-der-auftrag\n"}
