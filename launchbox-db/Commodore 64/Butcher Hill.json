{"altername_name": [], "name": "Butcher Hill", "overview": "Intelligence reports suggest that POWs have been captured and are being held hostage at the guerilla outpost on Butcher Hill. The game is divided into three sections. In the first section, players steer their dinghy along a river while avoiding mines and other obstacles. If the dinghy comes into contact with any mine, it explodes. However, when the player has collected ammo, the mines can be destroyed. Coming into contact with rocks causes the dinghy to bounce out of the water for a short distance. When a jetty appears, pressing the fire button allows the player to land and start the next section.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "July 1, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Imagitec Design", "publishers": "Gremlin Graphics Software", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butcher_Hill", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-oaUxWhw4U", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6421-butcher-hill\n"}
