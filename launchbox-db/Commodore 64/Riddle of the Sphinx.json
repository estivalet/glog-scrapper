{"altername_name": [], "name": "Riddle of the Sphinx", "overview": "In Riddle of the Sphinx the player must find his way through a maze to gain access to the Sphinx' tomb and answer the riddle to get the Treasure of the Sphinx. That's not as easy as it sounds though. To enter the tomb 500 units of treasure needs to be collected. Treasure is gained by doing various tasks that you will randomly be assigned as you make your way through the maze. These tasks are mini games of different kinds. Some are action based and some only depend on luck. Examples of tasks are surviving a earthquake, avoid being run over by camels, and running away from snakes. Fail with three tasks and it's game over.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Darrell Whittaker", "publishers": "Longman Group", "genres": "Quiz", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yQhsKVs2SE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109360-riddle-of-the-sphinx\n"}
