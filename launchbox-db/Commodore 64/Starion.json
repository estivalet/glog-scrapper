{"altername_name": [], "name": "Starion", "overview": "Patrol in your timeship to destroy the enemies and solve the historic puzzles. Aliens using a time machine have changed several crucial events in earth history. As Starion, a rookie starfighter pilot in 2010AD, you must correct these, in a hybrid of puzzle and action. There are 243 sectors to correct, each representing a year. After selecting one, you are involved in first-person space dogfighting, viewed from within your cockpit. Pay attention to your multi-directional scanner to locate ships and mines. There are also indicators for your fuel and oxygen levels, pitch and yaw, and engine temperature. Shot enemies release letters, which must then be flown over. Once an area is cleared, you must use the letters to form a word. Then, fly through the time gate, and decide which historical event the word relates to.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "David Webb", "publishers": "Melbourne House", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Du2Dw1RoM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109907-starion\n"}
