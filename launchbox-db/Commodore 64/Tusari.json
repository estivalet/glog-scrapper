{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tusari", "overview": "A Barbarian style game released on Zzap!64 Megatape #35 (10/1992). Some would call this a flick-screen platformer and was well received enough at the time that a sequel was mostly completed to the point that screenshots of play were made but the game was, sadly, never released. The creator, Martin Piper, has been trying to resurrect that old work and possibly get a revamped version released some time in the future.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Martin Piper", "publishers": "Element 114", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvrOv8eZbhk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/76147-tusari\n"}
