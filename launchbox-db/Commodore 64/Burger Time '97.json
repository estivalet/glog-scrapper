{"altername_name": [], "name": "Burger Time '97", "overview": "In this arcade game, which is a remake of the classic Burger Time, you are the head cook and need to prepare some hamburgers, hotdogs and sandwiches. This is very simple by reaching the corresponding ingredients over ladders and transporting them downwards by walking over them. So this gets not too easy, Mr. Egg, Sausage and Gherkin really disturb you. If you touch them, you will lose a life. As your own defense you can stop the troublesome eggs, sausages and gherkins for a short time with portions of pepper. As an alternative you can also put them into the burger. The pepper portions can be added to by collecting kitchen items that appear for a short time (as bottle of ketchup, salt caster, bowl of chips). Seven different levels of rising game speed with a maximum of 5 enemies await you and whet your appetite.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ruben Spaans, Roy Widding", "publishers": "J & F Publishing, Inc.", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmBZ-tcLdvI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/95770-burger-time-97\n"}
