{"altername_name": [], "name": "Alley Cat", "overview": "In this Hunchback inspired game, you are Thomas the cat and you have a date with a lady friend and you must move across the local area to get to her using walls. The game is a side view flick-screen game and you must move across each screen from the left to the right avoiding obstacles like flying boots and bottles. There are also gaps with gates and these must be jumped over but on later screens obstacles appear from the gaps like dogs and brooms. If you touch an obstacle or fall through a gap then you lose one of nine lives and start on the left of the screen you are on. Reaching the end of each screen gives you a bonus based on how long it took you to complete the screen. The game is essentially just a reskinned version of Robin to the Rescue, which was published by the same company in 1983.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "John P.
