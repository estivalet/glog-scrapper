{"altername_name": [], "name": "Racing Destruction Set", "overview": "An isometric racing game that sets itself apart by the large number of customizable options. The game comes with 50 built-in tracks, and the intuitive editor makes for infinite variety of races. Modify the existing ones or create one yourself. Set up sharp curves, crossovers, jumps (set the height), track width and more. Then set the track width and choose either ice, dirt or pavement for the surface. As if it weren't enough, gravity can also be modified, from a Moon-like low to a crushing Jupiter-like high that will keep your car glued to the ground, even after a jump.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Connie Goldman", "publishers": "Ariolasoft UK", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.81", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racing_Destruction_Set", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/d3RqgOk9YpE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72085-racing-destruction-set\n"}
