{"altername_name": [], "name": "Boing (Bubble Bus)", "overview": "You are Len the Programmer and in this flick-screen platformer you must collect all the royalties owed to you by a software house. You must navigate each screen collecting money bags while jumping gaps to other platforms, and while you can drop down to lower levels you can only fall so far before you are killed. Parachutes move around the screens and if collected allow you to drop down long distances once. There are also creatures moving around the screens and if you touch one, stay in one place too long or fall from a great height then you lose your only life and it is game over.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Stan Clear", "publishers": "Alternative Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1GK78a2xmE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/89778-boing-bubble-bus\n"}
