{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tiger Claw", "overview": "A relentless beat 'em up game for the 30 year old Commodore 64 home computer, developed by Lazycow and Saul Cross and released exclusively on cartridge by RGCD for backers of the C64 in Pixels Kickstarter (Fusion Retro Books, 2016). Help TIGER CLAW kick and punch his way through 24 screens of martial-arts mayhem to retrieve the four mystic scrolls before Fire Fist, Thunder Chain and Angry Tongue can reveal their true potential! TIGER CLAW was initially released as an entry in the 2014 RGCD 16K C64 Game Development Competition (where it placed 2nd out of 17 entries). Taking player feedback into consideration, the game was both further expanded and refined for the 64KB final, including the addition of extra rooms, foes and features, an arcade-style training mode and a 2-4 player deathmatch arena! The version on sale here features the same enhancements as the physical cartridge that backers of the C64 in Pixels Kickstarter received, minus the supporter text and additional easter eggs.
