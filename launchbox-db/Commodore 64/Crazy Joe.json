{"altername_name": [], "name": "Crazy Joe", "overview": "Riding a motorcycle extremely fast on a six-lane interstate highway is not everyone's idea of fun, but then not everyone is Crazy Joe. First let it be said that by normal standards, Crazy Joe is not quite right upstairs. In fact by any standards, Crazy Joe lives up to his name. A bystander would say he is suicidal, and this may be true, judging from his love of riding his motorcycle. Why is this crazy? Crazy Joe's motorcycle has no brakes, and furthermore, its idling speed is faster than many cars on the street. Now just for the moment put yourself in his shoes. Would you like to hit a car when you are going 90+ miles an hour? Neither would he, so as you play the game, weaving Joe in and out of traffic, be careful, because his life is at stake. The object of Crazy Joe is to allow Joe to enjoy life as long as possible. This is accomplished by keeping Joe on the road, and avoiding collisions with cars.
