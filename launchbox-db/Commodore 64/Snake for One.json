The next field can be reached through an exit that then opens. There is a running hourglass at the top of the screen and a counter below that shows how much time is left to collect the rest of the snakes. Below that again is the number of lives that are still available to the player. The color of this number provides information about the tens (white = 1 to 9, cyan = 10 to 19, red = 20 to 29, blue = 30 to 39, yellow = 40 to 49 and black = 50 and more). This is followed by the display of the points achieved and the three-digit display at the bottom right, which, depending on the color, has the following meaning: red = playing field number, cyan = snake speed and black = snake length.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Fami", "publishers": "CP Verlag", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86vFp0RiRks", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/127723-snake-for-one\n"}
