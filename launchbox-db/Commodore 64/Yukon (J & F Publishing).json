{"altername_name": [], "name": "Yukon (J & F Publishing)", "overview": "A solitaire card game variant developed by Maurice Jones and published in Loadstar #178. Yukon is similar to Klondike except you can move groups of cards from a tableau column even if they aren't packed in sequence. As long as the column you move the group of cards to forms a descending sequence of alternating colours at the join then it's a valid move. This is in contrast to Klondike where groups of cards may only be moved when they are in proper sequence. The other difference between Yukon and Klondike is that all the cards are dealt to the tableau at the start of the game so there is no stock to deal from.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Maurice Jones", "publishers": "J & F Publishing, Inc.", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/99242-yukon-j-f-publishing\n"}
