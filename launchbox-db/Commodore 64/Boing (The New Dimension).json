If you press the button too soon or too late, then you're finished. However, if you press fire at the correct time, the player will be able to jump over the barrel and cross the bridge. You will also score a bonus of 10 points. After the end of each stage, the barrel speeds up.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1997", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Philip Bayliss", "publishers": "The New Dimension (TND)", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/158440-boing-the-new-dimension\n"}
