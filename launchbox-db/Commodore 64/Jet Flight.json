Fuel is running dangerously low and in order to refuel your bomber, you must destroy the enemy city before landing. Use your bombs carefully as there is only one available at a time. Your skill level is increased after five consecutive landings. You may change your skill level up or down at the end of each game.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Cascade Games", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/107213-jet-flight\n"}
