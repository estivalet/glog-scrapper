{"altername_name": ["Ultima I: The First Age of Darkness"], "name": "Ultima I", "overview": "In the realm of Sosaria, a land divided by a thousand years of agony brought about by the malevolent sorcerer Mondain, a lone hero capable of turning back the tides of darkness has finally emerged. That hero is you. Your mission, a slight variation on the standard kill-the-evil-wizard theme, is to assemble a time machine, go back in time before the evil wizard developed unstoppable power and, then, of course, eliminate him. Ultima I is a remake of the classic RPG Ultima from 1981. You must travel to another world and save the land Sosaria from the evil wizard Mondain. The game features tile-based top-down overworld graphics and first-person perspective pseudo-3D dungeons. The original Ultima was re-programmed using assembly language, with updated graphics, minor changes in towns' and people's names, and some different puzzles.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "David Lubar", "publishers": "Origin Systems", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.07", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima_I:_The_First_Age_of_Darkness", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqZP51mslSg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/16939-ultima-i\n"}
