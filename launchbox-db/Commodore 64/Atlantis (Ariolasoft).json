{"altername_name": [], "name": "Atlantis (Ariolasoft)", "overview": "Atlantis is a text adventure game in which you take on the persona of an explorer. By chance, documents about the legendary lost city of Atlantis were found. A well-equipped group of scientists disappeared in search. The irresistible urge to solve the mystery involved will not let you rest for a minute. Silently expecting fame and fortune, you sell everything you own to outfit and finance a new expedition... The expedition begins in a boat on the sea near the ruins of the lost culture. The first difficulty is to take the right equipment and find your way to the outer wall of Atlantis through various adversities such as endless currents and voracious squid. After getting into the maze of passages and chambers (which is confusingly laid out to say the least), there are more valuables and pieces of equipment to find in order to lure the guardians of the untold treasure of this sunken civilization to clear the way.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Brigitte M\u00f6hle", "publishers": "Ariolasoft", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/116336-atlantis-ariolasoft\n"}
