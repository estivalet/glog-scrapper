{"altername_name": ["Warfire"], "name": "Wildfire", "overview": "A horizontally scrolling space shooter in which a spacecraft is piloted similarly to aircraft controls. You will need to continuously dodge the enemy bases and overcome the areas equipped with electrodes from which high voltage potentials generated by nuclear power plants are discharged. Other bases are equipped with areas where hammers crush, and can damage your ship beyond repair. During the flight you will be attacked by other spaceships that arrive in formations and can change their attitude making an escape route problematic. Of course you can do more than dodge, activate your weapons to take down enemies before they careen into you.
