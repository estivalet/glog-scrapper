{"altername_name": [], "name": "Atomino", "overview": "In Atomino you have to arrange atoms with each one to four free connections in a way so that stable molecules are created. The atoms fall with rising speed one after the other into a shaft, that offers space for 6 atoms, whereby the current atoms is always lowest. From there the atoms need to be placed on the game area. You can place altogether 56 atoms (7x8) there. If atoms with free connections lie next to each other they connect and as soon as a molecule without any free connections has been created, it is automatically removed from the game area. If the shaft for the atoms is more than full, the game is over.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Play Byte", "publishers": "Psygnosis", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomino", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIy6GDBvUUg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/69336-atomino\n"}
