{"altername_name": [], "name": "Escape and Evasion", "overview": "In this game you have to escape from a Nazi prison camp. There are two different ways to escape from the camp and therefore two different ways to solve the game. Your first escape always fails and you'll have to try again. Because you are only allowed to walk around in the camp during daylight and a lot of times you only have a few turns before you are captured by the guards (often only seven turns in each location), it\u2019s quite a puzzle to solve it without being captured. Luckily the game does not end when you are captured.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Keypunch Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/99240-escape-and-evasion\n"}
