{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bomb Chase: 2009 Special Edition", "overview": "Help Smudge collect 20 bombs in each arena. Watch out for the moving walls and avoid getting caught by monsters. A slightly enhanced sequel to the original Bomb Chase. A final version of the Bomb Chase game - 100% working, no errors or crashes, a game options screen and a few additional enhancements. Newer and better music + SFX option and plenty of levels to keep you gamers amused. Help Smudge gather enough bombs to advance on to the very next level, but the little fellow has to watch out. Those monsters and moving walls make his life more tougher. Avoid crashing into the walls, and monsters. Also try to avoid getting yourself into a tight spot, otherwise monsters will get you. Don't dither about for too long. Those bombs will explode if you're too late. This game was inspired by Frogger and also Alternative Software's Slug. Although I guess this game has a kind of bomberman style to it, where the player can drop mines and let them go off. :o)", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2009", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Richard Bayliss", "publishers": "The New Dimension (TND)", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpWwDijLeAs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75413-bomb-chase-2009-special-edition\n"}
