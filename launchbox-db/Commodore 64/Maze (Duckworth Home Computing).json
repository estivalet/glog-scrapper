{"altername_name": [], "name": "Maze (Duckworth Home Computing)", "overview": "An a-mazing maze game. Commodore Computing International v02-03 (Jul 1983) / from the book \"CBM 64 Programs - Volume 1\". Maze is a highly amusing and intricate journey through randomly created mazes in three different levels of complexity. The player is offered a choice of maze level and asked whether he wishes to see the maze being created. If the player opts for a maze without seeing its creation then he must be prepared to wait for a moment, until, with a flourish, the concocted maze appears. This game makes use of the four function keys on the right hand side of the 64. To manipulate the cursor through the maze, the keys' values are as follows: f1 =up f3 = left f5= right fl = down The player is timed against a seconds clock in the top left hand corner of the screen. A fast time for one of the small mazes is 26 seconds.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Richard Franklin", "publishers": "Duckworth Home Computing", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/122005-maze-duckworth-home-computing\n"}
