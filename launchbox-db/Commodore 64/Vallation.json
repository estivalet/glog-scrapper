{"altername_name": [], "name": "Vallation", "overview": "An action packed game, with over 70 rooms, beautiful graphics and an excellent soundtrack, this Cyberoid style game has the player attempting to escape from a space pirate base whilst taking out as many of the vile scum as you can. Move through the screens to see if you can find the way out. Mind the missiles - they can not be destroyed! And be very careful about the enemies that will shoot at the moment they see you. You'll have your hands full.", "platform": "Commodore 64", "release_date": "2013", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jason Kelk", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoqYZHGafRQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/76153-vallation\n"}
