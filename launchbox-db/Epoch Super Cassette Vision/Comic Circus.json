{"altername_name": [], "name": "Comic Circus", "overview": "Comic Circus is a variant of the earlier Exidy arcade game Circus which involves clowns trampolining around the screen popping balloons. In this game, while there are balloons to be caught, the main aim is to catch some doves that have escaped from their cages. There are three levels of play. The first involves a teeter-board and two clowns. You control the position of the teeter-board to catch each clown as they fall. Missing a clown will lose a life, but a successful catch will cause the other clown to rocket into the air. While in the air, the clown can pop balloons for points (if they are high enough) or catch a dove in flight. Sometimes, a dove will drop a bonus which lies on the floor for a short period of time and can be collected by the ground clown. In two player mode, the players alternate positioning the teeter-board. The second level is similar to the first, but two clowns are holding a trampoline while the third is in flight. The third level has some added trapeze artists swinging across the top of the screen. Catching the doves in the corners of the screen requires the clown to be carried across the screen from one acrobat to the next. Cut-scenes of the clowns chasing the doves are shown between levels. After all three levels are complete, the game loops.", "platform": "Epoch Super Cassette Vision", "release_date": "June 1, 1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Epoch", "publishers": "Epoch", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.62", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbm20vqqQnU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75565-comic-circus\n"}
