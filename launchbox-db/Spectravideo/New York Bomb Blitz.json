{"altername_name": [], "name": "New York Bomb Blitz", "overview": "In New York Bomb Blitz, the player is an invader from the planet TROK and assigned to destroy the city of New York. Unfortunately the player's warp drive was damaged in an asteroid belt, thus the player descends slowly. If anyone in New York is still alive when the player lands it is certain death, so there's no other option than to destroy all buildings before the time is up. The player can drop bombs one at a time to level buildings. Successfully completing a level unlocks new levels with higher difficulties.", "platform": "Spectravideo", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Spectravideo International", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/134058-new-york-bomb-blitz\n"}
