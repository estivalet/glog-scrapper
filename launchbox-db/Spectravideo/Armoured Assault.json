{"altername_name": [], "name": "Armoured Assault", "overview": "Armoured Assault is a tank battle game of the orthodox style which is enjoyed to this day. Two players start out in their home bases, with the simple goal of destroying the opposing tank. Each tank can take three hits before it is destroyed. Chasing each other uses up fuel reserves as well, and when the fuel gauge reaches zero, the tank is destroyed. The number of shots available is also limited. The screen is filled with barriers to hide behind, but each barrier has a hole in it which can be passed through both by shots and tanks.", "platform": "Spectravideo", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Spectravideo International", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/134054-armoured-assault\n"}
