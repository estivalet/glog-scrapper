{"name": "Super Bowling", "overview": "Do you really enjoy the sport of bowling, but just can't stand the ugly shoes? Have you ever wished you could bowl in your garage? In this sequel to fan-favorite SUPER BOWLING for the SNES, bowling has a whole new look and a whole new attitude. Choose a ball weighing from six to 16 pounds, adjust your power and hook, delicately pick a release point, and roll it on down the lane. SUPER BOWLING 64 features more characters than you can shake a stick at. In addition to the group of Japanese teens central to the game, you can play as a pixie, a blue giant, or a robotic penguin. Just to add to the offbeat nature of the game, bowling locations include a Japanese house, a brick-walled mansion, and a garage without gutters. If bowling is your sport, SUPER BOWLING 64 is your game.", "platform": "Nintendo 64", "release_date": "March 26, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Athena", "publishers": "UFO Interactive Games", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.55", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xV_QY6MhDWQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1178"}
