{"name": "Pyoro 64", "overview": "Pyoro 64 is a homebrew game for the Nintendo 64 released in December 2018 by buu342 based off of the Pyoro and Pyoro 2 minigames for Warioware Inc. on the GBA and is one of the most complete ones around. Done for the sake of learning more about the Nintendo 64 SDK, it is comparable even to Dexanoid in terms of polish where most homebrew games are wonky at best.<br><br>The game is fairly straight forward. After all, it\u2019s based off of a Wario Ware microgame so it has the complexity of something you\u2019d play on the Atari VCS.<br><br>You play as Pyoro, a bird with a long tongue who eats falling beans. Pyoro\u2019s tongue always shoots diagonally upwards at a 45 degree angle, which makes it difficult to aim for beginners, but provides more range and versatility than shooting vertically or horizontally.<br><br>It\u2019s an arcade-style game, so the main objective is to get a high score. The more points you get, the faster the beans start to fall and they also spawn more and more frequently. The game gets harder as you progress, so it really ends up being a race against your endurance and an increasing difficulty.<br><br>Getting hit by a bean means game over. If a bean falls to the ground, it destroys one of the floor tiles. This is bad news because it limits your movement on the screen. If too many tiles fall off, you\u2019ll become immobile and at the mercy of any bean that spawns above you", "platform": "Nintendo 64", "release_date": "2018", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "", "developers": "buu342", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZWMhdmLLs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/160223"}
