{"name": "Mortal Kombat 4", "overview": "Mortal Kombat 4 is the fourth main installment in the Mortal Kombat series of fighting games developed by Midway Games. Released to arcades in 1997, Mortal Kombat 4 is the first title from the series, and one of the first made by Midway overall, to use 3D computer graphics. It is also the last game of the series to have an arcade release. Eurocom (who had previously developed the Sega Saturn version of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3) later ported it to the PlayStation, Nintendo 64, Microsoft Windows, and Game Boy Color during 1998. An updated version titled Mortal Kombat Gold was released exclusively for the Dreamcast the following year.<br><br>The gameplay system in Mortal Kombat 4 is similar to that of the previous games; one of the most notable additions is the use of weapons and objects during fights. The storyline chronicles the attack from the corrupted Elder God Shinnok against his former comrades who trapped him in the Netherealm many years prior to the beginning of the series. The other 17 playable characters take part in the battle between good and evil, with the forces of light trying to stop Shinnok and the forces of darkness from conquering all the realms.", "platform": "Nintendo 64", "release_date": "June 23, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "M - Mature", "developers": "Eurocom", "publishers": "Midway", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.84", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_cTWumqmnM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1115"}
