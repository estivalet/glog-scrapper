{"name": "Mickey's Speedway USA", "overview": "Buckle up and get ready to race! Rally across America with Mickey and friends! Race around 20 All-American courses - from Alaska to the Everglades - as you try to track down the Weasels and rescue poor dognapped Pluto. Use Ludwig Von Drake's wacky weapons - such as the \"Antigrav-o-Kit Magno Flyer\" or the \"Stormy Weather Whenever Engager\" - to give you the edge. Then blast past your friends and listen as the drivers taunt each other using Disney's original character voices!", "platform": "Nintendo 64", "release_date": "November 13, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Rare", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.8", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBgImay06pw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1107"}
