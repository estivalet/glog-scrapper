{"name": "Gex 3: Deep Cover Gecko", "overview": "When Gex is watching TV one day, he discovers that Rez has kidnapped Agent Xtra (the agent from Gex: Enter the Gecko's backstory), head of the TV Terrorist Defense Unit, to get to him. He teleports to the batcave-like lair he has in the Media Dimension, and begins another adventure. Each level parodies a certain aspect of television culture (here the levels exist as stand-alone channels). Gex enters each level through a television set. He must collect remote controls to advance to the next level in order to complete his mission and rescue Xtra.", "platform": "Nintendo 64", "release_date": "September 29, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Gratuitous Games", "publishers": "Crave", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.64", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzwwjey8mWQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1076"}
