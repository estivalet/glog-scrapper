{"name": "LEGO Racers", "overview": "In LEGO Racers, the player assumes the role of either one of several pre-built Lego characters or a custom-built driver.  The camera is positioned behind the car, as in most racing games, and the player may make use of a variety of power-ups such as weapons and speed-boosters to increase their chances of winning.  The game supports keyboard and gamepad control, both of which can be fully customized in the game settings.  Customization: A feature in the game allows the player to build cars and drivers of their own design.  Both the driver's Lego minifigure and the car are built from scratch using a wide selection of LEGO bricks and parts.  This selection is limited when the player starts the game but expands each time the player completes a circuit.  The player may also use the Quick Build feature to play with a pre-made car.  Customization is purely aesthetic and has no effect on the performance of the car.", "platform": "Nintendo 64", "release_date": "October 22, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "High Voltage Software", "publishers": "Lego Media", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYyf5S8rTE4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1098"}
