{"name": "The Legend of Banjo-Kazooie: The Jiggies of Time", "overview": "In the game, you play as Banjo and Kazooie, a bear and a bird tasked with stopping the evil witch Gruntilda by hoarding a bunch of random shiny stuff scattered around puzzle-like platforming environments. The twist here, though, is that these environments are full, extensive, recreations of Hyrule from Ocarina of Time loaded with in-jokes from Nintendo's storied past.<br><br>The game is lovingly made, with detail and charm to spare. For example, the music consists of classic Zelda compositions but remade with Banjo-Kazooie's instrument set. Absolutely inspired! That's the kind of touch usually reserved for official collaborations like Cadence of Hyrule. Death Mountain, Kakariko Village, The Lost Woods, Kokiri Forest \u2014 they're all here and gorgeously remade and tweaked to fit the new style of gameplay. You'll travel to nine worlds with 100 Jiggies, 900 musical notes, countless eggs, Jinjos, Honeycomb pieces and more, all the while stumbling onto Easter Eggs that I can't in good conscience spoil for you. There are even custom Mumbo transformations!", "platform": "Nintendo 64", "release_date": "July 22, 2020", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mark Kurko", "publishers": "", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.44", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsLAThcwD5c&feature=emb_title", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/136005"}
