{"name": "Olympic Hockey 98", "overview": "Olympic Hockey 98 is a hockey game with the official IOC license of the Olympic Winter Games 1998 in Nagano. However, this game is identical to Wayne Gretzky's 3D Hockey; the only changes are swapped teams (14 national teams instead of 26 NHL teams) and the implementation of the Olympic tournament. The license does not cover the athlete's names, i.e. all athletes employed outside the NHL are replaced by generic ones.", "platform": "Nintendo 64", "release_date": "February 23, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Treyarch Invention", "publishers": "Midway", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "1.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVnyfCJhtb4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1145"}
