{"name": "Rampage 2: Universal Tour", "overview": "While technology may improve graphics and sound, some things never change. Rampage 2: Universal Tour is very much in tune with its history, barely deviating from the original city-stomping arcade game appearing in the 1980s. Like its predecessor, Rampage World Tour, Rampage 2 retains the original 2D worlds, but improves the graphics, completely re-rendering the characters. The premise remains the same: stomp out cities and wreck things in general. Some new features in Rampage 2 include four new characters (in addition to the original three), new attacks and combos, a power meter, and bonus rounds. The cart allows up to three people can play at once and there are plenty of new cities to destroy.", "platform": "Nintendo 64", "release_date": "March 31, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Avalanche Software", "publishers": "Midway", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "3", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.76", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4D82lskEhk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2776"}
