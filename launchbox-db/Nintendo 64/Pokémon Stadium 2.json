{"name": "Pok\u00e9mon Stadium 2", "overview": "Battles are the aim of the game here, as the crazy critters, more commonly known as Pok\u00e9mon, return to the N64.<br><br>Once again, you have the option of building a team of battle ready warriors for a range of battles against other Pok\u00e9mon trainers. Along the way, you will get the chance to fight for a range of Pok\u00e9-cups, or take your Pok\u00e9mon for a ride to a collection of mini-games for bonus prizes (or just for the fun of it).<br><br>4 players can compete in the one tournament, while the transfer pak allows you to upload your Pok\u00e9mon that you have from the range of Pok\u00e9mon Game Boy Games (including the original Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue, and the GBC Gold/Silver series). If you don't have the Game Boy games, you can choose from a selection of Pok\u00e9mon straight out of the box to get into the fight without mucking around.", "platform": "Nintendo 64", "release_date": "December 14, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "HAL Laboratory", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.09", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq6uOxZqKJQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/373"}
