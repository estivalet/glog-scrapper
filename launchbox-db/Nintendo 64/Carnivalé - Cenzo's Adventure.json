{"name": "Carnival\u00e9: Cenzo's Adventure", "overview": "Carnival\u00e9 is a game based on an obscure animated movie that only saw limited release in Europe. The game stars Cenzo, who must beat five bosses in a race to rescue his friends who have been turned into parts of the carnival rides. Most of the game will be spent grinding for coins in order to access each race.<br><br>The game was announced at E3 1999 by Vatical Entertainment and shown in an incomplete state. No playable build was available by September 2000 even though previews were written, and on February 8, 2001, it was announced that the game was cancelled at an estimate of 50-60% complete. The cancellation took the seemingly complete Game Boy Color version down with it as well.<br><br>Although the exact build date is unknown, notes for a build from July 21, 2000 were shared along with the prototype. Judging by the contents however, this build seems to post-date that one. The game can be finished but is still quite buggy and has some unfinished aspects, such as a non-functional password system.", "platform": "Nintendo 64", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Terraglyph Interactive Studios", "publishers": "", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161208"}
