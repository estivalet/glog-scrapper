{"name": "South Park: Chef's Luv Shack", "overview": "Chef hosts South Park: Chef's Luv Shack, which mixes South Park trivia with over 20 mini games in the mold of Mario Party. Most of the mini games are parodies of classic arcade games. The player chooses a South Park character (Kyle, Kenny, Stan, or Cartman) and answers the questions based on episodes from the cartoon series. If the player gets it right, they then spin a wheel, and get either cash, lose it all, or play a mini game (either by themselves, against the AI, or against other players if playing in multiplayer mode). The person who has the highest score (or the most correct answers) after a chosen amount of rounds wins.", "platform": "Nintendo 64", "release_date": "December 10, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "M - Mature", "developers": "Acclaim Studios Austin", "publishers": "Acclaim Entertainment, Inc.", "genres": "Party", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.7", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qU4PibjZwI4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/381"}
