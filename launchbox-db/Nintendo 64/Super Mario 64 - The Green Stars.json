{"name": "Super Mario 64: The Green Stars", "overview": "Super Mario 64 The Green Stars is a ROM hack made by Kampel125 and released in 2013.<br>Featuring 130 stars spread over 15 new levels and 7 secret levels, The Green Stars offers many interesting and well designed challenges, and is often compared to Super Mario Star Road, as a hack that feels much like the original Super Mario 64. Although it's not quite as popular as Star Road, The Green Stars is an excellent game for players just getting into ROM hacks.<br><br>The game is intended as a sequel to Super Mario 64, and also makes references to Super Mario Galaxy. Once again, Bowser has stolen the stars and used their power to create an army of monsters and kidnap Princess Peach. The Toads built a rocket to take Mario to Bowser, but Bowser locked it before Mario could get there, so the rocket serves as the first key-door of the game. The ending cutscene is the same as in the original game, though with minor changes. <br><br>Also listed in the credits for hacking and help are Kaze Emanuar, Frauber, and VL-Tone.<br><br>Not related to Super Mario 64: The Green Comet", "platform": "Nintendo 64", "release_date": "2013", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kampel125", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.72", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/vXapDMDTlvI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113203"}
