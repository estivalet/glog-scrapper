The game offers three playing modes: fish for fun, championship, and Custom Tournament. The first lets you choose a lake and fish there at your leisure. The second adds a competitive element. You pick one of two characters and participate in contests, where you have to catch a certain number of bass within a time limit. You start with simple gear, but every time you end up in the top 3 you gain points with which you can upgrade your gear (rods, boats, bait).", "platform": "Nintendo 64", "release_date": "July 30, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "GearHead Entertainment", "publishers": "Take-Two Interactive", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.14", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_lxbc_OxbM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1088"}
