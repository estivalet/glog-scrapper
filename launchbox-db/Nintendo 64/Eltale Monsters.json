{"name": "Eltale Monsters", "overview": "The game's story is set in Celtland, a fantastic medieval world that resembles Ireland. The playable character is an apprentice mage named Brian. Brian sets off to find his father, who has left the monastery of the mages - the player learns later that his father is looking for a thief who has stolen the \"Eletale Book\". The player must also collect elemental gems, which have been hoarded by powerful criminals, before confronting the game's final boss. <br><br>Because the North American and PAL releases of the game were considered too short and easy, Imagineer added new events and tightened some of the repetitive gameplay for the game's Japanese localization.", "platform": "Nintendo 64", "release_date": "July 9, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Imagineer", "publishers": "Imagineer", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/152316"}
