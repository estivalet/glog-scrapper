{"name": "Carmageddon 64", "overview": "The year is 2026 and fatal toxins have polluted the earth's atmosphere. Those humans lucky enough to get to the \"Climate Emulation Centers\" in time live in fear of the souls left on the surface - mutated, blood-thirsty zombies - the \"undead.\" The World Government has recruited drivers to deal with this problem. The solution is \"The Carmageddon\" - a death race in which drivers race against each other for the ultimate prize: a new life on the sun-drenched beaches of the off-world colonies. As well as a way of dealing with the zombies, it provides entertainment for the dwindling human population. You take on this challenge as Max Damage, a psychotic, cold-blooded racing machine. There is no second place. Drive to survive and let nothing and no one get in your way!", "platform": "Nintendo 64", "release_date": "August 25, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "M - Mature", "developers": "Software Creations Ltd.", "publishers": "SCi", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.14", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO5tLqNY9Qg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1048"}
