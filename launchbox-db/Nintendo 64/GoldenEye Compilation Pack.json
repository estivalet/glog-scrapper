There are some fun easter eggs to find, a bonus objective on 007 difficulty called \u201cCheese Tracker!\u201d (where you must find and destroy three pieces of cheese wedges), and a bunch of exciting cheat options (which are unlocked once the final mission has been completed on any standard difficulty).", "platform": "Nintendo 64", "release_date": "October 5, 2021", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "", "developers": "Werk", "publishers": "Romhacking.net", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162342"}
