{"name": "Rakugakids", "overview": "Rakugakids is a 2D fighting game, similar to Marvel Vs. Capcom. You select from a variety of hand-drawn cartoon characters, and fight using low, middle and high punches and kicks. As you'd expect with this type of game, special button combinations yield special, more powerful moves. There is also a 'crayon meter' that fills the more you attack your opponent - when it is completely filled, you can pull off a devastating special move.<br><br>An interesting feature of Rakugakids is that Story Mode can be played by using \"Training Mode\". In this mode, you select a character, and train them up by playing matches against any character you like. It is beneficial to train more, because you can choose to play Story Mode in 'Battle Mode'. This mode automatically plays the game for you using your trained up character. If you've trained enough, your character will react to opponent attacks in the same way that you yourself would.", "platform": "Nintendo 64", "release_date": "July 23, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "KCE Kobe", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.69", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DbU5zNjG3w", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1154"}
