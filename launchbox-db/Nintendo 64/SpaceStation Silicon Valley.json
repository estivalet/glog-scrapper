{"name": "SpaceStation Silicon Valley", "overview": "A space station that was built more than 1000 years before by Earth, shortly after its launch, vanished. The station has since then mysteriously reappeared and it's bound on a collision course with Earth. Unless Dan and Evo can stop it, all will surely perish. The idea behind the game is fairly simplistic: players take on the role of Evo, a robotic microchip that possesses the unique ability to take over the bodies of dead (robotic) animals. Evo makes his way through a variety of levels and worlds filled with different objectives and, of course, different animals.", "platform": "Nintendo 64", "release_date": "October 21, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "DMA Design", "publishers": "Take-Two Interactive", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.58", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHheSlKzS8M", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1173"}
