{"name": "Super B-Daman: Battle Phoenix 64", "overview": "Super B-Daman: Battle Phoenix 64 is based on the Japanese manga series Super B-Daman, itself based on the toy line B-Daman. Those toys are shaped like humans and kick marbles around. The goals vary, e.g. hitting opponents or a certain object, and are aimed at two or more players.<br><br>This is also the content of this game adaption. It basically consists of various mini games which all have the goal to hit various things with the marbles. To do so, a crosshair has to be moved over the screen to mark the goal. Examples for the mini games are a billiard or a \"Whack-a-mole\" variant. Besides this there is also a battle mode available in which up to four opponents walk over one of four areas and try to shoot the others over the edge. Those battles are either the scenario for three additional single-player tournaments or multiplayer. The usable characters, some unlockable through single-player successes, have different abilities like fire power or fire speed.", "platform": "Nintendo 64", "release_date": "July 24, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hudson Soft", "publishers": "Hudson Soft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.7", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/czAY6ZeK8O0?t=74", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83447"}
