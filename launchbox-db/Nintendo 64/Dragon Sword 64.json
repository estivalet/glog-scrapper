Apparently, playing through the game, gamers have only been able to get to the end of Level 7 before the game crashes. Yet, in the game's coding, two more levels are mentioned, albeit without any storyline. Setting out to locate these extra levels was my primary motivation for having a look at this game a little more closely.", "platform": "Nintendo 64", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Team Storm", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "2.46", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/bgOFtXjEW2c?t=31", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78616"}
