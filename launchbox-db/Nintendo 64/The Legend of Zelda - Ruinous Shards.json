{"name": "The Legend of Zelda: Ruinous Shards", "overview": "You are the last remaining piece of a powerful fallen god. To protect yourself as a child, you must steal the three shards of the Triforce (Power, Wisdom and Courage) and hide in the Temple of Time, until such a time when you are strong enough to take on the ultimate evil! Throughout your travels, you will see that much has changed from the Hyrule you once knew. Many items and power-ups were stolen and relocated by an infamous band of thieves known as the Order of Chaos. Many of the treasures are sprinkled throughout the world, but some of the most valuable are kept in the arduous Riddle of Time dungeon. Can you find it?....Can you beat it?", "platform": "Nintendo 64", "release_date": "March 25, 2015", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Daniel Haddock", "publishers": "Daniel Haddock", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.61", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwwNu2EXMCA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/97316"}
