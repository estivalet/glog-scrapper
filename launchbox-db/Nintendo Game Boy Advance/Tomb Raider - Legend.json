Lara comes alive with intricately animated expressions, moves and abilities. An arsenal of modern equipment, such as a magnetic grappling device, binoculars, frag grenades, personal lighting device and communications equipment, allows gamers to experience tomb raiding as never before.

Lara's character model features natural structure, realistic textures, detailed facial features, reactive eyes and fluid motion, all of which make her part of a living environment. New character animations and controls allow her to move through stunning environments with grace and precision, while an understanding of the game's original appeal reinvigorates the fundamental explore-and-solve adventure experience.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "November 14, 2006", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Human Soft", "publishers": "Eidos", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.46", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_Raider:_Legend", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrFiWrB_D4s", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/20288\n"}
