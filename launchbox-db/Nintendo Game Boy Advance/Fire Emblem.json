{"name": "Fire Emblem", "overview": "After 13 years of Japanese exclusivity, Fire Emblem finally comes to the west with Fire Emblem: Rekka No Ken, simply known as Fire Emblem in the west. This first western Fire Emblem is set 20 years before the previous game and follows three heroes; Eliwood, Hector, and Lyn as they attempt to solve the disappearance of Eliwood's father. What starts as a simple mystery turns into a conspiracy involving rival lords, mysterious cultists, and two children caught in the midst of what could herald the dreaded return of dragons into the world of Elbe. In order to save the world, the player will have to assemble an colorful army of Wizards, Theives, Knights and Mercenaries in order to make it through 25 chapters of tactical role playing strategy in order to come out on top. But be careful, as death is forever and almost no one is safe from the ravages of war.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "November 3, 2003", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Intelligent Systems", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.39", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_Emblem_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/3259\n"}
