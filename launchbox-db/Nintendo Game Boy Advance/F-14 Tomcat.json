{"name": "F-14 Tomcat", "overview": "Armed with an array of Air-Interceptor Missiles, and a 20mm \"Vulcan\" cannon, you fly a series of blue-water operations while engaging in head-to-head combat with MIG 29s, MIG 24s, and enemy targets. Numerous cockpit computer displays help you splash each enemy bogey with extreme precision, and when you've completed your sortie, attempt a heart-pounding first-person carrier landing that will challenge even the most experienced naval aviator. Fly alone or link up for some gut-wrenching head-to-head four player competition as you battle for supremacy of the skies.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "September 2, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Virtucraft", "publishers": "Majesco", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/3250\n"}
