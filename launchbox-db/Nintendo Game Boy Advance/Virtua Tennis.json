{"name": "Virtua Tennis", "overview": "Directly translated from the popular arcade stand-up, Virtua Tennis offers a light-year jump from the Pong-style tennis of yesteryear. Sporting rich 3-D graphics, crisp animation, and realistic sound effects, you'll swear you're courtside at a grand slam. But, thanks to the game's simple controls, you won't have to spend years at a tennis camp just learning a backhand. The game features hard-top, grass, and clay surfaces, all with distinct ball-bounce and sound responses. Choose one of eight internationally ranked tennis pros and play against advanced computer opponents, or plug an extra controller in and play a friend head to head. Just as in real championships, ball boys, chair umps, and even spectators react to your game.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "September 25, 2002", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Altron", "publishers": "THQ", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.62", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtua_Tennis_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xYsgeFy9Bg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/3916\n"}
