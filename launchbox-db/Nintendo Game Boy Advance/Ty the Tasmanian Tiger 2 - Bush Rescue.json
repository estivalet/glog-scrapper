{"name": "Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 2: Bush Rescue", "overview": "The Game Boy Advance rendition of Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 2: Bush Rescue is essentially a 2D-ized version of the 3D console design. The GBA title follows the exact story structure of the console platformer, right down to the still screens lifted out of the animated cutscenes. Gameplay-wise, Ty 2 is a traditional platformer that puts heavy emphasis on boomerang action. Players control Ty through huge levels that go all over the map; up, down, left, right... and each location and situation on the handheld is based specifically on the same location and situation in the console. The sprite graphics of Ty and his pals have been rendered from the 3D assets of the console bigger brother to retain a consistent feel throughout the game design. There are elements that are original to the GBA game; character profiles during conversations, for example, are supplied by drawn stills unique to the handheld game.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "October 12, 2004", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Halfbrick Studios", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.57", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ty_the_Tasmanian_Tiger_2:_Bush_Rescue", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7TBxUxU7ao", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/3909\n"}
