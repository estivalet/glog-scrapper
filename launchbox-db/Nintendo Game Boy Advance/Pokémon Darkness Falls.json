{"name": "Pok\u00e9mon Darkness Falls", "overview": "STORY: Darkrai is being controlled by the evil Team Zamrat to become its true, terrible form Darkrai-Primal, a form as strong as Arceus, which is what it was before it became good. Darkrai-Shadow is its in-between phase, a phase as strong as Kyurem. Darkrai is giving the region of Oneira nightmares. Cresselia knows of the ancient story of how Darkrai\u2019s Primal transformation energy was sealed into a stone. It informs the player of this, and warns the player that it must not let Darkrai transform into its primal state. Zygarde only knows that Darkrai is gathering a tremendous amount of energy, and picks up its scent near the beginning of the story when Darkrai is seen in an Onerian town. I haven\u2019t come up with a reason why it is in the Onerian town. It may be carrying out a mission of Team Zamrat.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "2018", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Team Salamence", "publishers": "", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/nvW9YbGKbr8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/123452\n"}
