{"name": "FILA Decathlon", "overview": "Fila Decathlon is a sports game similar to Track & Field where the player gets to compete in all ten events of decathlon (100 metres, long jump, shot put, 400 metres, 110 metres hurdles, discus throw, pole vault, javelin throw and 1500 metres). Like previous games in the genre, the gameplay involves large amounts of button mashing, but with added complexity. In all events running is done by alternatively pressing the a and b buttons. In the running events, rising at the start and dipping at the end is done with the d-pad. In 1500 meters the d-pad is used to change lane and to a fast rush. In the jumping events the d-pad is used to do the jump. To make a good jump the player first has to press down and then quickly up. The shorter the time this is done in, the higher or longer the jump will be. In these events the player also has to pick an optimal starting position. In discus throw and shot put the player has to press b quickly to gain horizontal speed and then a to gain vertical speed. Pressing a too long will lead to an over step. In javelin throw the player has to press left to draw the javelin back, then press down to minimize speed loss, and finally press right twice to make the throw. There are three game modes: championship, practice and multiplayer. In the championship the player plays all the events in the right order, while in practice the player is taught how to play them.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "March 29, 2002", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Athletic Design AB", "publishers": "THQ", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/26209\n"}
