{"name": "Motocross Challenge", "overview": "The game originally started development on the Game Boy Advance in 2004. It was cancelled by the publisher citing not enough confidence in it selling without being a licensed game. A Nintendo DS version was in development when the DS Lite was announced. Again, the publisher of the game decided the game would not fare well commercially. In 2007 the developers of the game officially released the ROM of the Game Boy Advance version for people to download. Certain homebrew companies took it upon themselves to port this game into a GBA cartridge and packaged it to look exactly like an official GBA release: although it was not. The gameplay in Motocross challenge is very similar to that in Excitebike. Players race on a track made up of different track pieces. There is a gas and boost button. Boosting will drain the boost meter, which will not work as long as it is empty. While racing using the normal gas button the boost meter will replenish.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "2007", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "", "developers": "DHG games", "publishers": "DHG games", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/129185\n"}
