{"name": "Pok\u00e9mon Emerald Genesis", "overview": "Introduction: Pok\u00e9mon Emerald Genesis is my personal remodeling of Pok\u00e9mon Emerald focused on upgrades to the Graphics, Engine itself and more generally, to present my take on modernizing the game. After following the community on and off over the last 10 years, it was exciting to finally entrench myself within the community while learning some new skills. With that said, if there's anyone that's been considering getting into hacking, I would highly recommend doing so, as it's an incredibly rewarding process to build a project from the ground up. I hope everyone enjoys the hack!
