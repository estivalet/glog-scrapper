{"name": "Avatar: The Last Airbender", "overview": "The GBA version of Avatar: The Last Airbender is different from the releases for other platformers. In this adaptation of the animated TV series Aang and his friends investigate the disappearance of the Waterbender Hiryu and discover it has been happening regularly. Controlling only Aang at the start, a group of three characters is soon formed with Katara and Sokka joining. The group moves together and the player can switch between them at any moment to take control of a specific one. It is mainly played as an action game, exploring the environment, dodging hazards and fighting enemies using a bird's-eye view, but there is also a strong element of environment based puzzle-solving. Characters can push boxes to manipulate the environment and they each have different abilities. Aang can use a high jump to reach high ledges, Sokka can activate switches using a boomerang and Katara can construct bridges. Characters have a health meter as well as a stamina meter that is drained when performing actions and then quickly refills again.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "October 10, 2006", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Halfbrick Studios Pty Ltd.", "publishers": "THQ Inc.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.63", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/20194\n"}
