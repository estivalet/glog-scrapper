{"name": "Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files: Spirit Detective", "overview": "Yusuke Urameshi was hardly a role model among Japanese schoolboys: somewhat of a ruffian, eager to get into fights, perhaps even deserving the title \"punk\". However, one day Yusuke tried to save a little boy, and was killed in the process. Unlike most of us, he has been given a second chance: he can continue living if he agrees to become a \"Spirit Detective\", a supernatural fighter who hunts down demons that plague our world. So the young man is back to his school life, with only a few people aware of his new secret identity... Based on the initial chapters of the Yu Yu Hakusho manga, Yu Yu Hakusho: Spirit Detective is an isometric action role-playing game. The player can switch between various characters from the manga and anime, including Yusuke himself, his rival Kuwabara, his love interest Kayko, and others. Most of the game consists of accepting and completing missions, which usually involve tracking down and eliminating specific demons. The characters can fight with bare hands or use special \"spirit attacks\". Experience points are awarded for defeating enemies. Once a character levels up, he/she can learn more moves (punching, kicking, etc.) and new spirit attacks, up to three per character.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "December 2, 2003", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Sensory Sweep", "publishers": "Atari", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.7", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yu_Yu_Hakusho:_Spirit_Detective", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocCsnUrUOf4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/3932\n"}
