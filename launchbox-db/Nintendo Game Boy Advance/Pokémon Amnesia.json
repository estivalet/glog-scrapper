{"name": "Pok\u00e9mon Amnesia", "overview": "Story: You're 12 years old in the region of Verde. You've already beaten the Pok\u00e9mon League and are well-known throughout most of the land. Life's going good, and one day you have a little friendly battle with your rival. Your rival's signature Pok\u00e9mon, a Dusclops, prepares to execute a Curse move on your Pok\u00e9mon. At the last second, as it unleashes the move, a small rock, a meteorite, 1/4 the size of a baseball, comes out of nowhere from the sky and streaks straight at you! The Dusclops is distracted and startled, and accidentally lays the curse on you. Your Pok\u00e9mon floats upwards and moves almost instinctively, in front of you and straight in the meteorite's path, loyally risking its own life for YOU, it's Trainer. Your Pok\u00e9mon is lethally pierced, and before you can comprehend, you're stricken, and you black out. Something strange happens...A mysterious force was at work during the meteor's hit. Later on, you somehow wake up 5 years later without your Pok\u00e9mon. After having a mysterious dream with a somewhat-familiar figure in it, you suddenly wake up from your coma in your own room. After speaking to your mother, you visit the local doctor (who coincidentally earned his M.D. in Pok\u00e9mon Research while you had been knocked out), who says that to help your amnesia, you should re-travel the land in which you had once already conquered...and to help the lazy doc get work done on the Pok\u00e9dex project assigned to him. What happens next? Why aren't you dead, and who or what prevented this from happening? Play and find out!
