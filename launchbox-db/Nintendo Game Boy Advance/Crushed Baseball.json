{"name": "Crushed Baseball", "overview": "With its unique comic-book inspired art style, Crushed Baseball 2004 will offer fast-paced arcade gameplay that will appeal to both sports and non-sports gaming fans. With its over-the-top style, players will be able to power-up characters and give them superhuman abilities and special powers called \"Mojo\" abilities. For example, a pitcher might throw a pitch that acts as a buzz-saw and slices through the hitter's bat; a batter may hit a ground ball that lodges itself in the field so it can't be picked up, and a fielder might use their suction glove ability to suction the ball into their glove to record an out.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "February 22, 2005", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Griptonite Games", "publishers": "Summitsoft", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.38", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/26171\n"}
