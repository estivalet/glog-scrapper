{"name": "Angelique", "overview": "Angelique is the first game of its series, the first game to be developed by Ruby Party and the first Neoromance IP. It is considered the first game for the Otome game genre that can be described as romantic simulators aimed for women. Originally released for SNES in 1994, the GBA version came eight years later. Angelique borrows elements from different genres: Japanese-style adventure (without puzzles), \"dating sim\", and (not overly complex) strategy. The goal is to make sure that Angelique has good relationship with the Guardians, maintaining the balance. For that, Angelique has to visit them daily, talk to them, and see what effects their powers have over the land. The situation is further complicated by the fact that Angelique - depending on the Zodiac sign the player chooses for her - has a certain affinity with one of the elements, and therefore, with one of the Guardians. This can lead to a love relationship, which will forfeit Angelique's chances to become a queen, but deliver an ending which can still be considered satisfying.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "March 21, 2002", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Koei", "publishers": "Koei", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/34010\n"}
