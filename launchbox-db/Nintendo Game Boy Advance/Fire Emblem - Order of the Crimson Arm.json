{"name": "Fire Emblem: Order of the Crimson Arm", "overview": "This is the fourth and from the looks of it on the way to being the final version of tacthack. For those that don't know, Tacthack is a hack for FE7 with a playable tactician with an original setting and characters. Issues and rebalances galore later here's an update and the first release of the FINAL version of the hack. This version goes all the way through to the epilogue and rolls endings. Not all the endings are in mind you, as we are still writing supports to see what goes where but a majority of the Single endings are in. Dialogue for the final map has been added so if you beat it and have a save feel free to go back and view it. as far as changelogs go. Light magic has been revamped Aras recieved a slap on the wrist nerf but shes still strong. Gerwulfs statline and growths have been changed hopefully for the better this time. Brendan received a buff as did sven. Some late game bosses have received changes. It's been a fun ride and I'll keep polishing it but they'll be slower more paced out updates. Thanks for all the help on this.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "", "developers": "TheMaskedRaider", "publishers": "", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/124550\n"}
