{"name": "2 Games in 1!: Dr. Mario / Puzzle League", "overview": "Dr. Mario/Puzzle League are recreations of two of Nintendo's most popular puzzle creations. Though Dr. Mario has already been released on the GBA as a Classic NES Series title, the version included in the dual-pack is enhanced specifically for the Game Boy Advance hardware instead of a straight emulation of the original NES title. Puzzle League was originally brought to life as Tetris Attack, but then re-branded on the Game Boy Color as Pok\u00e9mon Puzzle Challenge a few years back. The GBA version is also enhanced for the GBA's much more capable graphics hardware.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "September 13, 2005", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Intelligent Systems", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.55", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94SXAuMbdis", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/16949\n"}
