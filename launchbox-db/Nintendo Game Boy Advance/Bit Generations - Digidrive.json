{"name": "Bit Generations: Digidrive", "overview": "Digidrive is a puzzle game. The goal is to achieve the highest score, which can be done by elevating a fuel-propelled disc. To make the disc move, the player needs to collect fuel units, combine them and make an ignition. This can be done repeatedly, until the disc is crushed by a piston that is following it, which means game over. There is a two player mode, where players push the same ball against each other. It can be played against human opponent or CPU.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "July 27, 2006", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Q-Games", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_Generations#Digidrive", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75154\n"}
