{"name": "Fire Emblem: The Sun God's Wrath", "overview": "Fire Emblem: The Sun God's Wrath is a Game Mod of Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones produced by Blademaster. Initially conceived as The Sun God's Challenge and ultimately completed in 2020, this hack serves as a sequel of sorts to the ancient Corrupt Theocracy, one of the first custom ROM hacks to see completion. However, playing the original is absolutely not necessary, and even discouraged by the author himself. Set on the continent of Chicomoztoc, this game follows the events of the World War, in which the titular Sun God's nation, Pyronia, was absorbed into the Elemental Republic to create a new country, Amatera. With the suspiciously familiar Sun God, Pyron, returning and seizing control of Amatera, the continent is once again at his mercy. All is not lost. The country of Merv is home to a band of mercenaries known as Propater. When Amatera begins to encroach on Merv's land, Propater turns out to be the nation's best bet at stopping them. The narrative focuses on Astrea, daughter of high-ranking member Alice, as the fight against Amatera gets crazier and crazier, with monsters, dragons and betrayal alike. It won't be a war to forget.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "2022", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Blademaster", "publishers": "", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheSunGodsWrath", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czzWylUGuwo&list=PLA69XE9lKaI6bf2la_0FcQpV7VFXLnkVy", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161432\n"}
