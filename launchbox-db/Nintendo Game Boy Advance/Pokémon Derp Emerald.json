I really have no idea how this happened. There used to be a glitch where if you went onto cycling road and back out, you wouldn't be able to use the bike at all on any route, so I blocked off the entrance to the building and removed the fence so that one could still access the trainers. \u2022 Felicity's (Winona's) after battle text is sorta glitchy and I was unable to remedy it with changed text.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "August 18, 2011", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Karp", "publishers": "", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/TCr68TUNRPk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/123668\n"}
