{"name": "Daredevil", "overview": "Daredevil for the Game Boy Advance is your basic punch-kick-jump action platformer featuring Marvel's more unlikely superhero, a blind lawyer with enhanced abilities and senses. Though the game was marketed as a tie-in with the February 14th release of the Daredevil film, the GBA title is more based upon a less realistic, comic book design with bright and vibrant colors and the occasional \"Pow!\" and \"Bif!\" when knocking out opponents. Some levels cut across rooftops, others over vehicles in traffic; some go in buildings and underground. As players get through the 23 different levels, they'll uncover the game's original plot through comic book-style cutscenes.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "February 3, 2003", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Griptonite Games", "publishers": "Encore", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/26187\n"}
