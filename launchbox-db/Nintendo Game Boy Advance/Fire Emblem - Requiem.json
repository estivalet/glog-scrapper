{"name": "Fire Emblem: Requiem", "overview": "On the continent of Emire, 17 years ago, a thirteen year war (commonly referred to as the \u201cGreat War\u201d) ended as the vassals of a Emperor turned against him to remove him from power and established themselves as separate powers in the mainland, bringing about a new era peace in the lands. This hack follows those in the noble house of Olva and more specifically the two children of the head of the house, Valentine and Ash, as another noble house, Egarde, threatens them by declaring war on them. Meanwhile, a more sinister threat grows to present itself. This is an FE7 ROM hack, containing 26 chapters (prologue - ch.24 and a Gaiden chapter) It contains new events, maps, sprites, icons(not all) and story. (Not much in the way of other custom graphics, like UI, unfortunately) Supports are available between characters. (100% complete) Turn rankings have been worked out. (Sort of, the creator is not an LTC player) Hard mode is available and slightly different in some later stages.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "June 14, 2015", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sacred Blaze", "publishers": "Romhacking.net", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/115784\n"}
