{"name": "Pok\u00e9mon Resolute", "overview": "Pok\u00e9mon Emerald Enhanced Resolute is another Pok\u00e9mon Emerald Enhanced Emerald Hack that was made by wind1158. If you have played Pok\u00e9mon Victory Fire, you will know him. Since 2013, he has been developed this project and worked so hard to complete it. The result is that in 2014, the Final Pok\u00e9mon Emerald Enhanced Resolute Version was released. The latest release is Version 1.17 on November 28th, 2014. Like his previous hack, he still choose Emerald Codebase to make this Hack. I think he is a super talent creator with good skills. The game is awesome in game plot, graphics and music. I can not wait for the next releases. At the welcome screen, you can choose who you want to be. If you want to be a boy, you are LOGAN and to be a girl, your name will be ALMA. You are living with your Mom in Cedar City. With the help of Professor AVERY, you have your first Pok\u00e9mon to make an adventure around SYLON. Along your way, you gradually know about Team Mirage\u2019s plan to reform this region. You know your important mission is to stop them before you can challenge with Elite Four. Train your Pok\u00e9mon Emerald Enhanced so strong and do that. Good luck!!!", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "2014", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Wnd1158", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.95", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78831\n"}
