{"name": "Mega Man & Bass", "overview": "The story of Mega Man & Bass varies slightly depending on which player character is chosen. It begins when a robot villain named King breaks into Dr. Wily's laboratory and then the Robot Museum to collect the data blueprints for the creations of Dr. Light. Dr. Light alerts the hero Mega Man that he must go at once to the Robot Museum to confront this new enemy. Meanwhile, Bass (Mega Man's rival and Wily's greatest creation) hears of the new criminal's appearance and decides to prove himself the stronger robot by defeating King. Proto Man is the first to arrive at the scene. King divulges his plan to him; he desires to create a utopia in which robots rule the world over humans. To accomplish this, King seeks to create an unstoppable army using the data. With their own motivations, Mega Man and Bass set out to put a stop to King's plans.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "August 10, 2002", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Capcom", "publishers": "Capcom", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.87", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_Man_%26_Bass", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2218\n"}
