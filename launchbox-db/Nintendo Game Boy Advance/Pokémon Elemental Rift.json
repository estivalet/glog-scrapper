{"name": "Pok\u00e9mon Elemental Rift", "overview": "Basic information: \u2022 a Fire Red (BPRE) hack \u2022 386 Pokemon \u2022 English language \u2022 Entirely new characters/region/plot \u2022 No Fakemon The Plot: You\u2019re a young boy/girl from the sheltered Longpalm Island, located in the south of the Davoa region. The rain has been relentless \u2013 it\u2019s the wet season, it\u2019s supposed to be \u2013 but it has been particularly malicious this time around. A storm has blown some of the city\u2019s wooden fixtures into the water, and your Dad has asked you to make the quick trip to Main Island to get some supplies. The storm has caused the otherwise peaceful coastline to rise up over the beachfront, and as such wild Pokemon can attack you. Because of these more dangerous conditions, Professor Greatbeard has allowed you to take one of his Pokemon for protection. The unknowing hero makes the trip to Main Island, meeting researchers from the mainland that are currently studying the storm. Their attempts to glean the answer from some native Pokemon aren\u2019t working, unfortunately. Your journey leads you to Aquamaria Isle, where after a battle with Leader Fenton, you learn that the ancient elements are angered, and this is causing the disturbance. Fenton requests that you journey to the mainland, to learn about each of these ancient and powerful elements, and if you can, to quell their rage. Will you step up to the challenge? Features: Hacks are being released every day, all with a laundry list of changes and additions that could pretty much be copied and pasted. It\u2019s my job to differentiate this game from the others \u2013 to give you, the player, a unique experience that you won\u2019t find playing other hacked games (for a while, at least). With that said, a brief list of the features Pokemon: Elemental Rift offers you includes: \u2022 EVERY Pokemon has been modified to some extent \u2013 either in it\u2019s type, base stats, ability, movepool, or evolution method (obviously, for some). \u2022 Physical/Special Split. It is on every other hack too, but this time, all Pokemon are going to be able to take full advantage of it thanks to the changes mentioned above. \u2022 A compelling story, not necessarily fueled by an evil team that wants to take over the world, or other equally as clich\u00e9 plots. \u2022 Emulating the VGC tournaments you might be familiar with, all Gym Leader battles are 2v2. \u2022 Randomised Gym Leader battles (not yet implemented). \u2022 An alchemy-esque system for making items from the reagents you find off the ground. \u2022 Less (read: virtually no) reliance on HMs. \u2022 An entirely new evolution mechanic, making its debut in Pokemon: Elemental Rift. \u2022 I know the difference between your/you\u2019re and there/their/they\u2019re.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "2013", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "shamus24", "publishers": "", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/6psoP60wpiY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/123776\n"}
