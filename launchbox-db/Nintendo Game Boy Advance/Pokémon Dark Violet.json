{"name": "Pok\u00e9mon Dark Violet", "overview": "STORY: This world is inhabited far and wide by creatures called Pok\u00e9mon. For some people, Pok\u00e9mon are pets. Others use them for battling. There are numerous mysteries surrounding them, and they are a popular subject of research. Either way, humans live in harmony with Pok\u00e9mon, and they have done so for ages. Meanwhile, three teenagers, two from Pallet Town and one from Viridian City, decide to travel through the Kanto region to collect eight badges of Kanto, and to take on the Pok\u00e9mon League Challenge. The names of the teens are Red, Green, and Blue, and they each have received a Pok\u00e9mon from Professor Oak. They have no idea what awaits them, such as an increasingly threatening crime organization known as Team Rocket. The three of them will meet many people on their journey, some helpful, such as Blue\u2019s older sister Daisy. They will also meet Kamon, a younger boy who claims to despise Team Rocket, and is always right on their tail. What are Kamon\u2019s motives? Or more importantly, what are Team Rocket\u2019s motives? FEATURES: \u2022 210 Pok\u00e9mon available \u2022 All 210 Pok\u00e9mon will have sprites from my DS-style 64x64 Sprite Project \u2022 113 new moves added. Over half of them are Gen IV moves, a few Gen V moves, and a few custom moves. No old moves were replaced, thus there is now a total of 467 moves. At the time of posting this thread, I have spent the past two months working on a ROM base that contains these added moves, which this hack is based off of \u2022 A few old moves have new animations \u2022 Physical/Special split \u2022 Important characters have their own battle theme \u2022 Lots of redone music \u2022 Custom instruments, such as the church organ and the \"orchestra hit\" sample \u2022 All 210 Pokemon have their moveset redone (new movesets are based closely off of B2/W2 movesets) \u2022 Entire game re-scripted & re-mapped from scratch \u2022 Map layouts and architectural design of the Kanto region will be based off of how it appears in HG/SS. However, unlike HG/SS, Route 23 will actually exist. \u2022 And much more\u2026 Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald-ified features: \u2022 R/S/E style graphics \u2022 Removal of the stupid flashback feature to make it more like R/S/E \u2022 Removal of first-person view artwork to make it more like R/S/E (and every single Pok\u00e9mon game that's not FR/LG or HG/SS) \u2022 You literally face the trainer when another trainer walks up to you \u2022 Removal of colored-text based on gender \u2022 Proper item fanfares, instead of being limited to the level-up sound NEW GYM ORDER: 1.
