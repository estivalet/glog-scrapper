{"name": "Pok\u00e9mon Septo Conquest", "overview": "Information Name: Pokemon Septo Conquest Type: GBA Hack of: Fire Red Language: English Creator: Magneto20, Andyp159 ________________________________________ Story One year ago, the King of Septo was assassinated and his kingdom was stolen from him by two people known as The Dictators. Prof. Oak, who was working as the King's chief researcher, managed to rescue the King's only child and took him/her to his hometown of Faris Town. Now living with an alcholic foster mother, you, the only child to the King and the true heir to the throne of the Septo Region, must take the region back. After Oak gives you a Pokemon, you start your very own quest. The objective is to overthrow the seven Barons (minions of the Dictators), each of who rule one island. By doing that, you'll be able to conquer that island and get closer to the showdown with the two Dictators. However, there is more to it. You will also be fighting two evil teams: Team Vine and Team Solar. Team Vine are a bunch of eco-warriors who fight the save nature, but in bad ways, and Team Solar are an organisation of criminals who steal, pillage and kidnap people and Pokemon alike. ________________________________________ Features \u2022", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Magneto20, Andyp159", "publishers": "", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/124572\n"}
