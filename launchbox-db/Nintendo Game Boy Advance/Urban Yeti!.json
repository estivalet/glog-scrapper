{"name": "Urban Yeti!", "overview": "Urban Yeti is is a smooth scrolling 2 1/2-D platform adventure, and might very well be the strangest game you've ever played. You can smash your way through 4 twisting city stages, or attempt to avoid detection all together. Either way the Human AI will adapt as you progress - the more contact you have, the more aggressive they'll become. There are even some unique minigames to add to the excitement - Yeti Frisbee, managing the local \"Yeti Kingdom Of Eats\" restaurant, and catching poultry to offer to your prospective mate. You can even float down a lazy sewer river o' fun on a giant tube! Achieve the ultimate goal and show the world just what kind of Bigfoot you really are.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "August 16, 2002", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Cave Barn", "publishers": "Telegames", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.67", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_Yeti!", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/3914\n"}
