{"name": "Pok\u00e9mon Cerice", "overview": "Basically follows the R/S/E story-line, but is much harder, has tons of great new characters that support and clash with each other. Every character is important in some way. New evil team that poses an ACTUAL threat to the region. But I personally think, \"The most dangerous bad guy is the one who thinks he's doing the right thing\" which is the case in this game. Stephen (main villain) truly believes he is doing right, and you have to stop him before it goes wrong. There are actually two teams in this game, NYCTOPHOBIA (Stephen's) and REGIME (Seth's). The teams are at war with each other while at war for Hoenn. The game is a blast to play, and is really fun to Nuzlocke. Legendaries: Groudon, Rayquaza, Regis, Celebi With a revamped Hoenn Region this game is basically Pokemon Ruby but ALOT harder. There new characters, and sets up the story for the next two games in the series: Pokemon Valkyrie and Pokemon Theta Rose.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "2014", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "EUE", "publishers": "", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/14Zrv2jXUdM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/123317\n"}
