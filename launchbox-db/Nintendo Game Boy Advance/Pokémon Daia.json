{"name": "Pok\u00e9mon Daia", "overview": "POKEMON DAIA VERSION: I'm sure everyone here has played Gaia. Hack of the Year 2015, made by the man himself Spherical Ice? It's got everything: Tons of Pok\u00e9mon, amazing aesthetics, great gameplay, and a wonderful story. What's not to love? Well, I'll tell you what. There's one glaring flaw that Gaia has that makes the game virtually unplayable. What is that flaw? The name. Now, this hack is going to fix the name \"Gaia\" and make it so that you can play the hack without burning your eyeballs out. To do this I've switched every instance of the letter \"G\" In-game with a much cooler letter, \"D\". I did this by going through all of the scripts I could find and changing each letter individually. If Spherical Ice had done it right in the first place and named the hack Pok\u00e9mon Daia, I would not have had to waste my Monday night fixing his game. NOTE: When I was switching letters the D key was next to the C key so sometimes I put the wrong one by accident but it's an intended feature so don't worry. NOTE: I couldn't actually figure out how to change the title screen since Spherical Ice cheated and moved stuff around in his ROM. Because of this I would recommend you close your eyes and click the A button for the first 30 seconds after you open up the ROM in your emulator.
