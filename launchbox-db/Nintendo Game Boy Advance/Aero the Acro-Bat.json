{"name": "Aero the Acro-Bat", "overview": "Aero the Acrobat, the classic Sunsoft game for Super NES, comes to Game Boy Advance! Edgar Ektor (and evil ex-circus clown) has booby-trapped the circus with the help of a crazy flying squirrel named Zero and his fairground henchmen. Only Aero, a master of acrobatics, can diffuse the dangers of the circus and perform various death defying acts to amuse the unsuspecting audience. As the headlining act, Aero will walk tightropes, swing on trapezes, blast out of cannons and plunge off the high dive in order to find Ektor and put a stop to his evil plans. Great graphics and action-puzzle elements garnered Aero the Acrobat great reviews when it was first released in 1993. Now you can re-live the classic on Game Boy Advance.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "May 14, 2002", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Atomic Planet", "publishers": "Metro3D", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.34", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aero_the_Acro-Bat", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/17761\n"}
