{"name": "Pok\u00e9mon Cosmic Emerald", "overview": "Description: Alright, so this hack has been a long time in the making - having been worked on in little phases at a time, ever since I started learning about ROM hacking several years ago. Can\u2019t really remember when (maybe 2010?). It was put on hiatus several times due to life-stuff, and a couple of times I had even redone it from the beginning to find and remove any and all glitches/errors; I spent most of the time trying to figure out what the most minimalist/efficient ways to implement everything were. Finally it's here, and as of the latest update nearly all of the features I had planned are in! A change-log (different from the one here) has been kept documenting every single change that has been made (as well as dates-of editing, revisions and future ideas), for the sake of being able to quickly and easily pinpoint the cause of any errors. Choices in programs and how they were used have been carefully considered to avoid glitches. I am also trying to keep the save-data structure of the base ROM intact so that the regular Emerald's game saves will remain 'backwards/forwards' compatible (originally for testing scripts, graphics, etc.). This may change in the future, but it will be on a separate branch of this project. Gameplay/Summary: This is largely a \"quality of life improvement\" type of ROM hack, and does not alter the main storyline. It retains all the features the original Emerald has, but adds several things to the mix to make it more fulfilling and fun to play. Remember those days when myths like going to the Moon after a certain number of rocket launches/weeks were a thing? Several things like that will be accounted for, but with some changes/twists to how they are done. There is a moderate increase in difficulty (not really big, just aimed more towards veteran players), but there are rewards to compensate. Only a select few newer-generation features have been added, as I wanted to keep this hack\u2019s gameplay as faithful to the pre-2007 scene as possible while still adding a few of the newer games\u2019 improvements in function. However, I might add in a few newer-generation Pok\u00e9mon as special appearances/events sometime in the distant future. Apparently, expanding the Pok\u00e9Dex could cause the game to require its own exclusive saves only, but I think that will be OK as long as one does not plan on using this hack's saves with the regular Emerald (or vice-versa, I think). You may want to also keep in mind that if I happen to release an expanded-Dex version at some point, it may not be compatible with a save file from the regular version of this hack. Regardless, I will not stop updating the regular one and will still release it as well if that is the case. I would also try to find a way to make the original saves compatible with the new one. Main Features: \u25b2 The PRNG glitch has been fixed by re-incorporating Emerald\u2019s unused PRNG system. \u2022 May need someone to check this one, just to fully confirm that it has been implemented properly. \u25b2 All 386 Gen 1-3 Pok\u00e9mon available. \u2022 A New Evo Stone that evolves Trade-Evo Pok\u00e9mon. \u2022 More Roaming Legendaries, events, different sprites, etc. --- Some events based on Day/Night/etc and/or game completion status. \u2022 Pok\u00e9mon from different Pok\u00e9Dex sections have their own battle music (based on region/availability in-game). --- i.e. Encounter a wild Pidgey somewhere, it will play Kanto\u2019s Wild Battle theme; while Sentret has an exclusive Johto Wild Battle remix. \u2022 Most events/Legendaries have signature themes too (i.e. Suicune and its Crystal battle theme), though related ones share themes. \u2022 A special Event-Shiny somewhere. \u2022 Check the Game Corner prizes in Mauville City for a few surprises. \u2022 Mirage Island can now be reached in a much better (and honestly much more sane) way than in the original R/S/E. --- Available on Sunday mornings after capturing 180+ National Dex Pok\u00e9mon. The National Dex always includes Hoenn Pok\u00e9mon as well. \u25b2 Special Event Tickets are available via unlocking Mystery Gift and finding the MG Receptionist upstairs in all Pok\u00e9mon Centers. \u2022 Obtaining the Nintendo Event Tickets in this hack uses the real Mystery Gift scripts that legitimately unlock them! :) \u2022 Mystery Gift is unlocked the same way as normal: Fill out the questionnaire in a Pok\u00e9Mart with \"LINK TOGETHER WITH ALL\". \u2022 How to obtain them this time: --- Eon Ticket: Become the Hoenn League Champion. --- AuroraTicket: Defeat Steven at least once. --- MysticTicket: Raikou, Entei and Suicune all defeated/fled from or captured (Like w/Crystal Version's Ho-oh, but more lenient). --- Old Sea Map: Get 180+ National Dex captures. \u25b2 Day & Night System (Early-Morning, Morning, Day, Afternoon, Twilight, Evening). \u2022 Affects battles too, and will eventually affect music on maps in a future update. \u25b2 Graphics have been altered in many different areas/aspects (nothing too fancy, but it is an improvement IMO). \u2022 (i.e. Meteor Falls looks very different now, many menus are new colors, trees/caves different texture, etc). \u2022 New Battle Backgrounds based off of HG/SS\u2019s and recolored to match CosmicEmerald's altered environments. --- The tiled indoor trainer battle style and the Champion one were designed by me using Paint. \u2022 Edited Rayquaza\u2019s backsprite so that its lower \u2018fin\u2019 points backwards instead of oddly forward. \u2022 New (but still similar) Title Screen! \u2022 You may find that certain maps look quite a lot different than they were previously. \u25b2 Upgraded B/W Repel System (lets you choose whether to use another and which type). \u25b2 TMs are reusable. \u25b2 All Pok\u00e9balls (except Safari Balls) are reusable until capture. \u2022 Are slightly less common and cost quite a bit more for balance\u2019s sake. \u2022 No more worry about resets, savestate-abuse or running out of chances to capture a Shiny. \u25b2 Your Pok\u00e9mon receive EXP when you capture another, like at the end of a normal battle. \u25b2 Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s Natures have color-coded stat boosts/drops. \u25b2 Rough Skin Ability Fix (from Gen IV). \u25b2 EVs cap at 252 instead of 255 (in order to not waste remainder points). \u25b2 Somewhat steeper difficulty curve than official games. \u2022 Storyline-based/secret trainers are stronger, Event-Legendaries stronger, etc), but nothing too insane. \u25b2 Running While Indoors. \u25b2 Final Trainer Card is no longer Gold, but is \u2018Platinum\u2019 (well, not that literally, but it\u2019s totally different than before). \u25b2 Upgraded EXP system: All Pok\u00e9mon directly participating in a battle will receive full EXP, not half unless you use EXP Share to avoid having to switch them out. This allows you to have more options for how to train. \u25b2 Steven can now be re-matched daily, and depending on when you face him, the Champion Battle theme might play (like in R/S). \u25b2 It is now possible to \"turn off\" the random calls on the Pok\u00e9Nav (except for the scripted ones in the story) by using Prof. Birch's machine in the lab. \u25b2 The clock in the player's room now lets you know what the day of the week is before showing the time (there is a minor bug on the Playstation Portable). Because of this, it can now help you know if the in-game day is correct when you want to do a special Event! \u25b2 The Safari Zone's expansion area is now split between nocturnal and diurnal Johto Pok\u00e9mon (North and South, respectively). \u25b2 The bed in the player's room can now be used for sleeping, and possibly investigating a 'nightmare'. \u25b2 Lamps on maps that have them now have a lit/glowing animation during night hours. \u2022 Mt. Chimney's lava is also lit up at night. \u25b2 Features 4 new RSE-style music remixes I made (3 from G/S/C), + 2 hidden Crystal-Version tracks from the original. \u25b2 As another special feature for this ROM hack: Rayquaza and Jirachi have a 1/200 Shiny chance. \u25b2 A few Legendaries' movesets are very slightly different, for event battle purposes. Levels on most of them have increased, so be prepared. Some are also holding rare berries, and by researching these berries' tag info you can get an idea of who has which berry. See if you can steal them with Thief before they are used in battle. \u2022 Also, the roaming Legendary Bird Trio now have a catch rate of 5 instead of 3 to make things a tiny bit less frustrating. \u25b2 There are rumored 'prehistoric' Magikarp on Faraway Island, battle them a bit to see what is so special about them. \u25b2 Cave of Origin is now accessible permanently after fully completing the Jirachi event.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "August 15, 2018", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Skyvorpal A.K.A.
