{"name": "Pok\u00e9mon Shiny Gold Sigma", "overview": "All started when I think I need to do something special. Something different and unique. And looking ofr information about Pok\u00e9mon, I found some communities and blogs (Pokecommunity, WaH, and so on). I use a remake of Pok\u00e9mon Gold (now more simmilar to Crystal mixed with Fired Red) because I believe PKMN SG was an awesome and a potential game. So I start to make improvements and learning about the rom hacking. Tools for create your own version for this game makes a new complete world to me, so I tried to make a revolution. \u00bfWhat if I make an improve of a remake? In order to do that, I choose SG due to his simplicity, atractiveness, and gameplay. I made improvements in sound effects, graphics, Pok\u00e9mon's, trainers, history, and an unbelievable new historyline! I truly hope that you can enjoy this game and made me a critical analysis, a review, feedback, or just a comment in this section below. I would totally appreciate that! So... anyway, thanks to all \"pokeforums\" and \"pokeromhackers\" that make me do this. Specially those who can make this possible like Zel (original creator), and so many people, like Javi4315, Sayer301 and so many more at WaH and Pok\u00e9co! Thank you all very much and let's play!!", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "2015", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ash_Milotic", "publishers": "", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.59", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78837\n"}
