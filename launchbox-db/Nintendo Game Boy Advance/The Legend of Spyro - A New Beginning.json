{"name": "The Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning", "overview": "The Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning is a side-scrolling platformer based on the console game of the same name. As Spyro, players can attack with melee attacks and charge tackles. In addition to this, breath attacks are unlocked as players progress through the game, allowing Spyro to control the elements of fire, ice, earth and lightning. The R Button will let Spyro fire a stream of breath, while the L Button will hurl a ranged attack at foes. Finally, players can press L and R together when their purple Fury Meter is full to unleash a more powerful attack. A New Beginning also features mini-games such as a whack-a-mole style game, flying levels which play somewhat like a shooter in the vein of games like 1942. You'll even come across boss battles as you attempt to free the other Guardians from the evil dragon Cynder's forces.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "October 10, 2006", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Krome Studios", "publishers": "Sierra Entertainment", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.96", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Spyro:_A_New_Beginning", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21673\n"}
