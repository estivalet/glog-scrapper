{"name": "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory", "overview": "Developed by High Voltage Software and licensed by Warner Bros., Charlie and the Chocolate Factory puts players right into the world of the film. You'll find the factory rampaged by the other children, who are running amok with greed and impishness. Use your special candy powers and the assistance of the Oompa-Loompas to restore order to Willy Wonka's sugary establishment. Beyond this, Charlie will have to use a variety of candy to overcome obstacles and potential enemies. Everlasting Gobstoppers, for instance, are basically rocks that Charlie can throw around. The game features celebrity voice talent and the likeness of Johnny Depp as Wonka.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "July 15, 2005", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Backbone Entertainment", "publishers": "Global Star", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/26167\n"}
