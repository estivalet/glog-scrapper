{"name": "Pok\u00e9mon Deneb", "overview": "IMPORTANT: This is a Japanese ROM Hacks and there is no English translation available at this time. \u2022 For help, questions, or bugs please head over to their Bulletin Board System (BBS) which may be found on the index of their Wiki. Features: \u2022 The Fairy-Type is now implemented, and some Fakemon now turn into Fairy types. \u2022 Some Pokemon are no longer Version Exclusive, some Deneb-Exclusive Pokemon become Procyon-Exclusives, and some Procyon-Exclusives become Deneb-Exclusives. \u2022 The boxes with question marks means the Pokemon isn't implemented at this time. \u2022 Wikkin now becomes a Grass/Fairy-Type rather than a Grass/Ghost-Type. \u2022 Because Aurostice is now an Ice/Fairy-Type, it's fiery counterpart becomes a Fire/Fighting-Type. \u2022 Peacoptic is now a Ghost-Type rather than a Psychic-Type. \u2022 Ptervus is now #123 & Pteriarch is now #124 in the Pokedex. \u2022 It is possible to get Smalmon & Trojalmon. (Only accessible via AdvanceMap due to the Super Rod being inaccessible.) \u2022 Some Pokemon used by trainers changes if you are playing Deneb or Procyon. \u2022 A few places appear to have references to other games. \u2022 Numerous stuff are now different compared to the beta. (Ex: The Pokedex now functions differently) \u2022 Numerous Sprites are now redesigned, even their backsprites got redesigned. (Ex: Skarmory's backsprite is now it's animated backsprite from the DS Pokemon games.) \u2022 Despite #029, #032, #313, and #314 are Version Exclusives, it is possible to get them in the opposite Version, happens by breeding, and has a 50% chance. (However, I'm not counting this.) \u2022 Some Pokemon that weren't Version Exclusive now become Version Exclusives. (Ex: Skarmory is in Procyon while Tropius is in Deneb.) \u2022 New places have been added, and some places got altered as well. \u2022 It now has a ridiculously great soundtrack. Contributors note: I have played and almost 100% beaten Both Deneb and Procyon. It's a lot of fun. I'm not fluent in Japanese, if there was ever a move I was not completely sure about I would use the scan/picture option on the Google Translate app when playing on my handheld. For PC emulation I swap between Virtaal, Microsoft Translator App for Windows 10, and QTranslate each excel in their own ways. I wouldn't let the language barrier Keep you away from these two, they are astounding, especially with how far technology has come for translating, you have options.
