{"name": "Pok\u00e9mon Radical Red", "overview": "This hack is at its core a difficulty hack, but with massive additional features added to help you navigate through this game's difficulty. If I had to draw a comparison it'd be quite similar to Drayano60's enhancement hacks, which provide access to nearly all the Pokemon while also adding relevant buffs to make all sorts of different Pok\u00e9mon and playstyles viable, but with an insane amount of quality of life features added that also make many gruesome tasks far less tedious. This is a joint project with me and a friend koala4; although I've handled pretty much everything on the technical side he's assisted me immensely in balancing, giving suggestions, doing the wild Pokemon locations for the most part, testing, and more.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "September 11, 2020", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "soupercell", "publishers": "", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.57", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/144616\n"}
