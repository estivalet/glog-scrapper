Collect all 20 badges, 8 from each region and 4 from the \u2022Orange Islands, and enter the Pok\u00e9mon Championship! \u2022Variety of different environments, including space and the past \u2022Travel through snowy mountains, underwater temples, tropical islands, volcanoes, swamps, jungles and more! You also get to travel to Space with one of the organizations you will encounter to investigate the recent sightings of Jirachi. With the help of the Chronos Tribe and Celebi's power, you also get to travel back in time, and discover the origins of the regions and their secrets. \u20229 rivals \u2022Not just one, but 9 rivals to battle you along your way to be the best trainer there is! Some are new, and some are old, including Red, Crystal and Ritchie! The best part about this is that you are able to choose how to interact with each one, which means you can ignore/avoid/get rid of most of them should you choose to. However, you will be rewarded if you keep them all around by the end of the game, since every one of them is important in their own way. \u2022Decision-based storyline \u2022In the game you will encounter several organizations, small, big, evil, good, each with its own dreams. After finding out about their goals and intentions, you get to choose which one to side with, or even two. You can even not side with any organization and oppose them all. The decisions you make will heavily affect the final part of the game and the ending. \u2022Latest generation Pok\u00e9mon \u2022Currently, there are only 673 Pok\u00e9mon catchable in this game. the 649 from all 5 generations and 24 from Gen VI. I'm currently working on the sprites of the rest of the Gen IV Pok\u00e9mon, and I'm hoping to release a new patch with all 719 Pok\u00e9mon available soon! \u2022New moves and abilities \u2022The majority the new moves and abilities of the newer games have been implemented. Some new ones have also been added as well. Just like with the \u2022Pok\u00e9mon sprites, a patch with all moves and abilities so far will be released in the near future. \u2022New music \u2022Almost all the tracks in this hack have been changed. Some are familiar tracks from the latest generations, some are completely new, thanks to Link and his team from Pok\u00e9mon: Phoenix Rising. \u2022Side quests \u2022Attend the Pok\u00e9mon Ranger academy and become a Pok\u00e9mon Ranger! Rangers can take on side quests to help people in need from all the regions. There are over 30 side quests of varying difficulty, some have special rewards and new characters involved. By completing them, you get Quest Points which can be redeemed for rare items. This game was released by Christos as an April Fools joke claiming to have features like 3 regions, 9 rivals and a decision-based storyline. It's actually a short game with a few puzzles and a final boss fight. It should take around 30 minutes to complete.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "April 1, 2016", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Christos", "publishers": "", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/uuKjnj-YlvQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/122076\n"}
