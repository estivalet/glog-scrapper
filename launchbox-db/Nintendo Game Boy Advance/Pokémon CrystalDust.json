{"name": "Pok\u00e9mon CrystalDust", "overview": "Story: We've been here before, haven't we? Once again, you're put back into the shoes of either Gold or Kris, and sent on your way across the Johto region. With the most accurate scripts, text, features, and everything else compared to other remakes, you can nostalgically relive your past GBC memories and experiences in full-on GBA style on your way to becoming a Pok\u00e9mon master. Features: \u2022 Complete recreation of almost everything imaginable; sprites, sound, maps, events, and text all are almost perfect copies of their GBC counterparts, only upgraded. \u2022 May be based off of Emerald, but most things are taken from FireRed, including sprites, tiles, battle graphics, font, animations, ... \u2022 Day/Night system; remade entirely from scratch and now supports light-up windows! \u2022 More ASM hacks than I can count; even little things like Mom on the Pok\u00e9gear have been hacked to make them Crystal-accurate. \u2022 Scripts are made to the best of my ability; no more exclamation mark without the sound! \u2022 No sound glitches; this hack uses the right free space, and uses the built-in FR voice-groups.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "2010", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Diegoisawesome", "publishers": "diegoisawesome Productions", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.58", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/3IStMRqbaGw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/123412\n"}
