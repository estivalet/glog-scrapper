{"name": "Crash & Spyro Superpack: Crash Bandicoot: The Huge Adventure/Spyro: Season of Ice", "overview": "A compilation featuring: Crash Bandicoot: The Huge Adventure Crash Bandicoot makes his first appearance on the Game Boy Advance, in this, his 5th adventure against arch nemesis, Dr. Neo Cortex. This time Cortex has shrunk the world down to a tiny size and it is up to Crash to explore the 20 levels full of dangerous creatures and terrain to collect crystals that will (hopefully) change the world back to its normal size. Crash explores 4 worlds, split into 5 levels. Levels range from side-scrolling action to underwater swimming and 3D chase sequences (similar to those in the original Playstation series) designed using the GBA's unique FX features to create a 3D illusion. You will also play flying shoot 'em up levels, a boss levels at the end of each world, and the usual extra bonus levels and secret items. Spyro: Season of Ice Spyro the dragon returns for his first adventure on the Game Boy Advance. This time, Grendor has turned all of the fairies of the Dragon Realms into ice blocks, sending out his band of Rhynoc warriors to collect them, and use them to stop his headache. Only the fire power of Spyro, with Hunter and Sparx on hand to help, can save the fairies from a certain Panadol future. Unlike the Playstation series, Seasons of Ice has the player controlling Spyro through an isometric overhead camera. However, all of Spyro's skills are still available to use, including his flame breath and glide. And the flying bonus levels (similar to that of the original Sonic series of bonus levels) make use of the Mode 7 technology in order to create the 3D like perspective (as used in Mario Kart: Super Circuit and F-Zero: Maximum Velocity).", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "October 25, 2005", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Digital Eclipse", "publishers": "Sierra Entertainment", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/18386\n"}
