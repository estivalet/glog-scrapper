{"name": "Fakemon FireRed", "overview": "Overview: The main feature of Fakemon FireRed is the addition of 252 original Fakemon, plus 19 Mega Evolutions. Every single mention of any legitimate Pok\u00e9mon has been removed - including overworlds, dialogue mentions, game corner icons and much more. There are also a lot of more modern features and \"quality of life\"-features added, which I'll list below. The story remains the same as in the original Pok\u00e9mon FireRed Version, there are only a few minor \"lore\" changes to accommodate some new legendarily in place of the old ones. But nothing that changes how the events of the game plays out. The hack, as it exists now, is complete and playable all the way through. It's even possible to complete the Kanto Dex all within one save file, no trading or anything required. Not necessarily easy, but definitely doable. I have some future plans about adding Fakemon enough to complete the National Dex, but that's in the distant future. Features: \u2022 The Physical/Special Split including visual indicators. \u2022 Three new types: Fairy, Digital and Cosmic. \u2022 A ton of new moves. A lot of new moves from later generations, but also a few completely original ones. \u2022 A ton of new abilities, like Technician, No Guard, Bulletproof and Skill Link. \u2022 A ton of new items. Stuff like Eviolite, Assault Vest and a couple others. A few completely original evolution stones are included, as well. \u2022 Roughly two generations worth of Fakemon. The game should be completely free from any and all appearances from legit Pok\u00e9mon. 252 Fakemon, plus 19 Mega forms. Every non-legendary should be available before the E4. \u2022 Original cries for most of the Fakemon. 150 of them, to be exact. Not all of them, because I'm kinda terrible at inserting cries. \u2022 Running indoors! Best feature. \u2022 A day/night system. \u2022 Reusable TMs. Doesn't always work, though. \u2022 A system for checking IVs in the stat screen. \u2022 The repel system of BW2. (\"The repel wore off, would you like to use another?\" That thing.) \u2022 New evolution methods. Gender-dependent, map-specific evolutions, level-up while holding an item, day- or nighttime evolutions and so on. \u2022 Mega Evolutions. Works ALMOST perfectly, and every Mega Stone should be available somewhere before the E4. \u2022 Extra areas added to Kanto. A few areas have been expanded and extra maps have been added to house specific Pok\u00e9mon or items. \u2022 Pewter City is almost doubled in size, make sure you check out the expanded area to the west. \u2022 Molet Tunnel (formerly known as Diglett Tunnel) has been expanded drastically. \u2022 Viridian Forest has been expanded a bit. \u2022 Eggs hatch at level 1. \u2022 Poison's effect in the overworld are gone. \u2022 EV cap at 252 per stat instead of 255. \u2022 You get the regional and the National Dex the same way you normally do, but every evolution is possible from the get-go. \u2022 Lucky Egg gives just a bit more extra experience. You can pick it up in Pewter City. \u2022 Life Orb works in the same way as Destiny Knot in regard to breeding in the newer games. I'm pretty sure this works like it's supposed to, but I haven't tested it thoroughly. \u2022 Flame Body and Magma Armor halves egg hatching time. \u2022 A guy in Pewter City will tell you the exact IVs and EVs of your Pok\u00e9mon.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "September 23, 2019", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Pekin", "publishers": "", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "https://fakemonfirered.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/jLqG-wLhX-0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/123891\n"}
