{"name": "Pok\u00e9mon Clays' Calamity III", "overview": "Story: Ten years have passed sense an unnamed hero stormed Kanto and defeated the strongest Pok\u00e9mon Master in the Indigo League, Clay. The battle lasted several days, resulting in the destruction of a city and the reduction of Pok\u00e9mon gym. Without the minimum requirement of eight official gyms Kanto was knocked out of the Pok\u00e9mon League Verified Regions. One decade has passed and Kanto has now been re-entered into the League. Gym Leaders have been re-evaluated and trainers have been raising their skills. Try your hand at this new take on an old generation of Pok\u00e9mon; the conclusion of the open-world, Fire Red trilogy, Clay\u2019s Calamity III. ------------------------------- What this game offers: This game, like the previous two, is an open world Pok\u00e9mon patch of Fire Red. The available Pok\u00e9mon have been greatly expanded upon and an attempt has been made to make every Pok\u00e9mon (within the first three generations) available. All blocked passages, rival battle scripts, cuttable trees, locked doors and trainer blockers have been removed, making this a completely open world experience from the opening screen. Travel from city to city on boats, by foot or by hidden warp pads. This game, keeping with the aspect of the first two, has Pok\u00e9mon locations based upon folk-lore, type regions, environmental factors (like moon stones) and level diversity. Hidden passages litter the region and secret trainers wait to be found. Continue the journey and follow this story to the epic conclusion!
