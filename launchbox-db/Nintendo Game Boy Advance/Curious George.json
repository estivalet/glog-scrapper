When the Man with the Yellow Hat travels to Africa in search of a lost artifact, he returns with some unexpected cargo -- a curious little primate named George. Guide George as he runs, jumps, climbs and swings his way through a variety of adventure-packed levels from the jungle to the Big City, where his spunky and fun-loving nature endears him to new friends and lands him in a series of mis-adventures. Make monkey business as you help George and his friends discover the one item special enough to save the museum from the bulldozer. Loads of bonus content and challenging mini-games keep players busy long after the main story is done.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "February 1, 2006", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Torus Games", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.08", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/26172\n"}
