{"name": "4x4 Off-Roaders", "overview": "4\u00d74 Off-Roaders is a cancelled Gameboy Advance racing game that was in development by Small Rockets in 2001. The game was powered by a nice voxel 3D graphic engine, something that was not usual on the 2D-centric GBA console. We dont know why the game was never released, but it\u2019s possible that Small Rockets never found a publisher.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "2001", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "", "developers": "Small Rockets", "publishers": "", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZBeSneCIpg&t=3s", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165538\n"}
