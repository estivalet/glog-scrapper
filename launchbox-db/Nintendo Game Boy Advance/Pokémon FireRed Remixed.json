{"name": "Pok\u00e9mon FireRed Remixed", "overview": "Hey everyone! This is my first, and final hack. Ever since I've gotten into Nuzlocke, I've wanted an adventure where anything can happen. Unfortunately, everyone always catch the same Pokemon because of the small encounter lists per area. I wanted a ROM where everyone would have a VERY different collection by the time you arrive at the Elite 4. I once saw a similar ROM where you could catch gens 1-3, but most of them were only on the islands. So here it is. All Kanto, Johto and Hoenn Pokemon can be obtained in the wild. One species of EVERY evolution line can be obtained before you fight the Elite 4 (Legends an exception). A definitive Nuzlocke experience! Several additional features were added for fun. Now includes Gen 3 Special split! Features - One of every evolution line can be found in the wild - Evolutions fixed. Trade and Hold Item Evolutions now use either levels or Sun/Moon Stones. - New items added to Celadon. Training items, Evolution Stones, and cheap vitamins! - Move Relearner now lives with the Deleter in Fuschia. - Wild Legendaries! Special Legend Hunters will tell you where they hide. - [7/10/2015] Now includes a different version that has the Physical/Special split. Take your pick! And more! The rest will be detailed in the included text files.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "July 10, 2015", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "RemixV4", "publishers": "", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.12", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/115406\n"}
