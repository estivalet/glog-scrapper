{"name": "Flappy Bird", "overview": "Don't we all hate Flappy Bird? Hasn't this game been ported to every possible platform already? The answer was no, and I figured someone had to do it. I wanted to make it as close to the original as possible and therefore the game is played in portrait mode. Sorry emulator users! If you flash the game to a cartridge, set the save type to SRAM and save size to 64 kbit. Written in C, compiled with DevKitARM.
