In August 2003, Microsoft purchased the rights to the High Heat franchise from 3DO, however, Microsoft has yet to develop a new title in the series. High Heat was traditionally known for possessing more simulation-style qualities than competitors World Series Baseball, All Star Baseball, or Triple Play Baseball, but frequently lagged behind in graphical quality. At the core of High Heat\u2032s gameplay was its batter-pitcher interface, which was often hailed as the most realistic of its era.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "March 6, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "", "publishers": "3DO", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.7", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Heat_Major_League_Baseball", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhJ9c1TtA9I", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/28294\n"}
