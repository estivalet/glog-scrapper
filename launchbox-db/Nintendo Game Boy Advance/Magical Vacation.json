Japanese singer, model, and actress Mika Nakashima was featured in the television commercials for Magical Vacation. The game is a standard RPG adventure game, where the player interacts with the overworld to progress the story while battling against enemies in a turn-based battle system. There are 16 different elements in the game, each of which is stronger than another specific element, and weaker against another. Exceptions to this rule are: the love element (not stronger or weaker than any of the other elements), the dark element (stronger than all other elements except for love and light), and the light element (no weakness).", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "December 7, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Brownie Brown", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_Vacation", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73701\n"}
