{"name": "Hatena Satena", "overview": "Hatena Satena was released by Hudson way back in 2001 for the Game Boy Advance. It's similar in nature to the Picross series of games - single screen grid puzzles where you're given clues on where to chip away, eventually revealing a picture in the grid. Elements of Minesweeper are also present - each square you reveal will let you know how many of the same color square are touching it. Hatena Satena features cute, interesting character designs by Super Lovers, the fashion and art brand that (I believe) did Super Milk Chan. While the game is solely in Japanese and does feature quite a bit of text, it's completely playable by anyone regardless of language skill.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "October 4, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hudson Soft", "publishers": "Hudson Soft", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatena_Satena", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/117111\n"}
