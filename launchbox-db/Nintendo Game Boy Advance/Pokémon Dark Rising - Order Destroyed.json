{"name": "Pok\u00e9mon Dark Rising: Order Destroyed", "overview": "Pok\u00e9mon Dark Rising: Order Destroyed is the next-episode of Pok\u00e9mon Dark Rising 2 and also the prequel of Pok\u00e9mon Dark Rising 3. It is a Pok\u00e9mon hack made from Pok\u00e9mon FireRed by DarkRisingGirl, a talented female hacker. The whole Pok\u00e9mon Dark Rising series has a strange game play style. While it is not the same as the others, it requires you one chapter each time you play. Let\u2019s imagine like this: there are some episodes of this game, when you play one episode and finish it\u2026 please use the Save State function of your emulator to continue the next episode. Why do I say that? Well, this is a survival-designed hack\u2026 which means if you lose, the game is over. That is the meaning of using Save State. Pay your attention while playing and surely you will understand much more about this.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "2015", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "DarkRisingGirl", "publishers": "", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.88", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78802\n"}
