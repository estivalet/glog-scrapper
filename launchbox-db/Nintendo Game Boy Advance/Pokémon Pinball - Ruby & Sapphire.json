{"name": "Pok\u00e9mon Pinball: Ruby & Sapphire", "overview": "Pok\u00e9mon Pinball: Ruby & Sapphire has all the features you'd demand of a pinball game, including bonus tables, lots of bumpers and ways to score massive points. As with your standard videogame pinball game, the left button on the D-pad and the A-button control the flippers with the R/L triggers used to shake the table. The catch here is that everything is themed in Pok\u00e9mon. Instead of a ball, you make use of a Pok\u00e9ball. Instead of standard bumpers, you're hitting the Pok\u00e9ball against other Pok\u00e9mon, and the ultimate goal is of course to \"catch 'em all\". The game features 200 Pok\u00e9mon, two main tables, and link cable support.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "August 25, 2003", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Jupiter Corporation", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.86", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Pinball:_Ruby_%26_Sapphire", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=la15ZCuonm4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/3364\n"}
