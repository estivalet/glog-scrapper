{"name": "Pok\u00e9mon Mirage of Tales", "overview": "Story: You play the role of an orphaned sixteen year old who gained a scholarship at the Pok\u00e9mon Trainer Academy in the region of Avlar, a peaceful country with a rich history famed for its vast woodlands and high mountains. It's the day of your graduation; time for you to get a job and go out into the big wide world with your Pok\u00e9mon by your side. Open World: Wild Pok\u00e9mon and trainers in all areas grow stronger as you do, so you can go anywhere you like right from the start. Restriction does exist in situations where you might have to unlock an item to progress to some areas (e.g. you'll need Surf to cross water), but there's no random roadblocking (e.g. pointless Viridian City coffee guy). Choose Your Trainer Class: You can pick your own Career once you graduate from school. Each one will give you a different storyline and alternate quests. So, depending on the career you take you'll experience the game completely differently! There are currently 7 Careers to choose from, but you may only take one. Choose wisely! Other Features: Choice based gameplay - every decision you make will affect the story in some way. Modern battle engine, to include the the Physical/Special/Status split and Fairy type. Custom sprites for trainers and OWs by me, for a fresh new look Pok\u00e9mon from Gens 1-6.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "2019", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Avara", "publishers": "Avara", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTldrG9iEs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/122037\n"}
