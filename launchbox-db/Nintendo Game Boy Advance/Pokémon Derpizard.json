{"name": "Pok\u00e9mon Derpizard", "overview": "Info: Before you dismiss this hack as stupid or not worthy of your time, I would like to let you know, this is what I would like to call a \"comedy\" hack. This hack isn't meant to have a nice unique storyline or loveable charactors. It is meant for someone to be able to come home to after a long day and be able to sit down and laugh a bit at the sheer stupidity involved in the making of this hack. The idea for POK\u00e9MON DERPIZARD was formed during an IRC conversation over at RHO. Basically, we were all throwing around the funny looking sprties that went into the Japensese RED and GREEN versions when the sprite for Charizard came up. Features: \u2022 Replaced all the NPCs with the sprites of Pokemon. \u2022 New storyline.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "2013", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "clacla", "publishers": "", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/NjtNxwsF8Vw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/123669\n"}
