{"name": "Ready 2 Rumble Boxing: Round 2", "overview": "The Game Boy Advance version of Ready 2 Rumble Boxing: Round 2 captures most of the over-the-top action found in the N64 version, and the training mini-games help to add a little variety to the gameplay. From Mama Tua's 400 pounds of fury to Afro Thunder's funky taunts, Ready 2 Rumble Boxing: Round 2 lives up to its rep for absurd arcade action. Midway has proven itself to be a heavyweight when it comes to arcade-style sports games, with heavy-hitting titles like NFL Blitz and NBA Showtime proving that it can walk the walk as well as talk the talk. Now Midway is bringing its popular Ready 2 Rumble franchise to Game Boy Advance, complete with a 3D rotating ring and 11 boxers bursting with attitude.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "May 30, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Midway", "publishers": "Midway", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.6", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KTJX3-QvwU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21605\n"}
