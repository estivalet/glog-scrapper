{"name": "Little League Baseball 2002", "overview": "Little League Baseball 2002 is a baseball game carrying the Little League Baseball license of the organization that organizes local youth baseball and softball leagues throughout the United States and the rest of the world. Different teams are available each with different statistics based on batting, fielding and pitching. Game options include a difficulty level selection, adjusting the amount of innings and a selection of different fields. Before the start of the game the batting order can be determined. During the batting phase a behind view is used when swinging with an orange circle that can be moved around green cross-hairs to strike at the right time. When pitching the same perspective is used with a red dot moved around the green cross-hairs, a separate bar for pitching power and four options for the pitch type. During field play the perspective shifts to a bird's-eye view.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "May 27, 2002", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Handheld Games", "publishers": "NewKidCo", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21698\n"}
