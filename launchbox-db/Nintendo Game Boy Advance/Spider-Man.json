{"name": "Spider-Man", "overview": "Spider-Man, the classic comic book co-created by Stan Lee, is now a major motion picture. This conversion of the movie to the video game world takes the major storyline, characters and artwork of the Spider-Man movie and adds a lengthy backstory and new characters. The Green Goblin is the main villian here, and as Peter Parker you must defy gravity using your spider crawl, web-slinging and spider-sense abilities to track down Spidey's nemesis through the skyscapers of New York City. The major inclusion for this title over the previous Spider-Man series (on Playstation also by Activision) is aerial combat. Attack the enemy mid-air while web-slinging, rise and decend while swinging and banking around buildings create a greater emphasis on Spidey's greatest asset, the spider web.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "April 16, 2002", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Digital Eclipse", "publishers": "Activision", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.3", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man_(2002_video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJdBxJ6J2M0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/3523\n"}
