{"name": "Pok\u00e9mon Emerald Hard Edition", "overview": "Introduction: Welcome to Pok\u00e9mon Emerald: Hard Edition, this is what I call a 'enhancement' of Pok\u00e9mon Emerald, which is basically Pok\u00e9mon Emerald, same story-line, same trainers, same gym leaders etc. but with a few added features, this is not to impress anyone but to simply make this game a little more challenging and fun, I personally made this for myself just as a challenge for me but I thought why not share it and see how others enjoy it. I am aware there are others like this, i.e Pok\u00e9mon Emerald 386, but this game focuses on the difficulty concept rather than All 386 Pok\u00e9mon being catch-able, hence the name. Bare in mind that this game is still at early stages so it has very few features but if it's gets positive feedback then I will proceed to add more features and make this enhancement better, this is really just a test, you may think that this is simple and that it only takes a couple of hours to edit the features I have created in this but editing EVERY trainers, Gym Leaders, Rivals, Grunts, Elite Fours Pok\u00e9mon takes A LOT of time, effort, coordination and patience as you have to get it correct and set the reasonable levels for that certain area, I found myself working on this for 3, nearly 4 days which included A LOT of planning and preporation and I think I've put quite a lot of hard work into this so I hope you enjoy this as I have tried to make it as hard, but fun as possible! Features: \u2022 Increased Difficulty \u2022 Gym Leaders all have teams of six with ALOT higher levels! \u2022 Trainers difficulty and level increased, including ALL trainers in Hoenn, ALL Magma/Aqua Grunts, Admins & Leaders and your Rivals team is much more complex, that's right, no more having to put up with Mamga & Aqua grunts using the same Pok\u00e9mon over & over! \u2022 Rematch trainers edited to a very high level. This means EVERY trainer & Gym Leader registared into the Pok\u00e9nav, when you rebattle them, their teams will be ALOT stonger, and tougher! \u2022 Elite Four Team tweaked, every member has 6 Pok\u00e9mon plus higher levels. \u2022 EVERY trainer has been edited, some with there original team, some with different Pok\u00e9mon and harder Pok\u00e9mon, this also includes Team Magma & Aqua grunts, Admins, Leaders and your rival. \u2022 386 Pok\u00e9mon obtainable in the grass areas, caves, water, all around Hoenn! \u2022 Evolutions changed, i.e Kadabra would normally evolve to Alakazam via trade but now Kadabra evovles to Alakazam at level 40. (See List on pokecommunity) \u2022 No more constant Poochyenas & Zubats battles for Team Magma & Aqua! \u2022 More features to come!", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "2016", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "blue Gucci", "publishers": "", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/UTVFejck5H0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/123792\n"}
