{"name": "International Superstar Soccer Advance", "overview": "International Superstar Soccer Advance is the second Konami football game to appear on the GBA, with several updates compared to its predecessor. The game contains 58 national teams, up from 40 in the previous game. There no longer is a license for real players' names, though, so all players are fictional. Returning game modes are friendlies, the international cup and penalty shootouts. The new Super Star Mode is a series of do-or-die three-minute matches against superstar teams. The view on the pitch has been adjusted from the isometric perspective of the predecessor to a view from the sidelines. As before, the game allows to set a variety of formations and strategies. It also includes a choice of weather, different stadiums and referees, and again, running commentary by Jon Champion and a two-player mode via link cable.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "January 24, 2003", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Evolution Studios", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/23340\n"}
