{"name": "Metal Slug Advance", "overview": "A survival training camp for new Peregrine Falcon recruits has just begun, where the recruits must survive on an unnamed island with limited supplies and weaponry. However, a large blimp begins to hover above the island, as General Morden's troops parachute down and attempt to build a new base, while successfully capturing many of the new recruits. Players play as either new recruits Walter Ryan or Tyra Elson as the survival training soon becomes a full-fledged assignment for the remaining recruits as they pierce through enemy lines.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "November 2, 2004", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Noise Factory", "publishers": "SNK Playmore", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.29", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Slug_Advance", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVxr47jkufM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/10743\n"}
