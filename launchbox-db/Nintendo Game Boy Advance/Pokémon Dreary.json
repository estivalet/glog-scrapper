Dreary was started on August 24, 2018, and was completed on January 28th, 2019. My goal is to tell a short story that I whipped up in my head during one of my regularly scheduled dozing-off sessions. By no means is this a hack that is meant to bedazzle you with its technical prowess! By all means, this is a hack that is meant to make you think, challenge you, and be an all around memorable experience. Let me know what you think! Stumble upon a glitch? Have a suggestion? I appreciate any and all feedback! I hope you enjoy playing Pok\u00e9mon Dreary as much as I enjoyed making it.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "March 26, 2019", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Anthroyd", "publishers": "", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/IhFMQH7VL4Q", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/123688\n"}
