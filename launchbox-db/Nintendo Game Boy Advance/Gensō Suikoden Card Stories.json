Both were released in the fall of 2001 in Japan, neither have been translated into other languages. Unlike other areas of the Suikoden franchise, in which the storyline is a major element of gameplay, Card Stories focuses mainly on the card battles themselves and less on the plot. Most of the cards feature characters who appear in both Suikoden and Suikoden II of Konami's role-playing video game series. Several cards also feature characters who would later go on to appear in Suikoden III. The GBA game retells the story of Suikoden II with a few changes to how they transpire.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "September 13, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Will", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/30522\n"}
