{"name": "Ms. Pac-Man Maze Madness", "overview": "Ms. Pac-Man Maze Madness is a combination of classic Pac-Man (or in this case, Ms. Pac-Man) action, maze exploration and Sokoban-like puzzle elements. Players take on the role of Ms. Pac-Man and have to save Pac-Land once again. Although the game is in full 3D, players can only move along designated paths. The four Wonders, mystical regions separated from the rest of Pac-Land by force fields, contains four Gems of Virtue: Generosity, Truth, Wisdom and Courage, each holding enough power to help keep Pac-Land safe from evil. However, an unknown enemy has transformed the Enchanted Castle into a haunted house, in turn starting a chain reaction of evil all around Pac-Land and the four Wonders. It is up to Ms. Pac-Man to enter the 3D designed worlds of the four Wonders and put the evil to rest for good.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "November 3, 2004", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Full Fat Productions Ltd.", "publishers": "Namco Hometek Inc.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ms._Pac-Man_Maze_Madness", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB2vvnmr508", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21708\n"}
