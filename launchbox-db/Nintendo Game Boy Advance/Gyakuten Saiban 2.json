{"name": "Gyakuten Saiban 2", "overview": "Order in the court! Phoenix Wright, Ace Attorney is back for more defense attorney action! Taking place a year after the events of the previous game, Phoenix encounters many faces from the previous game... some friends... some foes. Using your keen deduction skill, and armed with the evidence, you'll be able to guide Phoenix through four new cases as you pick apart witnesses' inconsistencies and lies. Justice For All is a courtroom simulation and adventure game. Players gather evidence and interrogate witnesses as they try to help Phoenix Wright prove his client's innocence. New to the sequel is the addition of \"Psyche Locks\", which cover a person when they are hiding a particularly dark secret. You'll need to break open these locks by presenting enough evidence to convince the person to tell the truth. In addition, Phoenix's courtroom blunders are now represented by a \u00absoul energy\u00bb meter instead of set hit points. This means that some mistakes can cost you a lot more than others!", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "October 22, 2002", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Capcom", "publishers": "Capcom", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.19", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/85223\n"}
