{"name": "Classic NES Series: Zelda II: The Adventure of Link", "overview": "The Adventure of Link bears little resemblance to the first game in the series. The Adventure of Link features side-scrolling areas within a larger world map rather than the bird's eye view of the previous title. The game incorporates a strategic combat system and more RPG elements, including an experience points (EXP) system, magic spells, and more interaction with non-player characters (NPCs). Link has extra lives; no other game in the series includes this feature.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "October 25, 2004", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Nintendo EAD", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.65", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zelda_II:_The_Adventure_of_Link", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/189\n"}
