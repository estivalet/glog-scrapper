{"name": "Pok\u00e9mon FireRed Backwards Edition", "overview": "About: Have you ever thought \"You know, man... if you like, went south of Pallet at the beginning of the game, you would TOTALLY be able to go through Kanto backwards\"? Yeah, didn't think so. But a while ago, I did, and I decided to make it a reality. Fire Red: Backwards Edition (also going by the title Der Erif when I try to seem slightly more creative), is a a hack of Fire Red in which the maps and scripts are messed with in a way that makes the player go through the gyms in the following order: Cinnabar Fuchsia Saffron Celadon Vermillion Cerulean Pewter Viridian. Other changes: \u2022 Many Pokemon have been buffed. In particular, plenty of bugs are stronger. \u2022 Some gym leader TMs have been changed so you don't get overpowered moves early. \u2022 Some typings have been changed. Not many, though. \u2022 Surf has been given a lower base power. \u2022 Cut has been given a higher base power and made steel type. \u2022 Naturally, every trainer has been changed. \u2022 Wild Pokemon have been changed as well. This hack has nearly every Pokemon between Gens I and III, with the exception of legendaries and a few others. \u2022 \"Teleport\" is now a psychic type explosion. \u2022 Pokemon appear in puddles, like Gen V. \u2022 There is a post-game, so be sure to make your file saves without savestates. Known Bugs: \u2022 Moltres doesn't disappear if you catch it, but it does if you kill it. \u2022 Some tiles in Saffron, the swamp, and Diglett's cave are clear when they should not be. \u2022 The rival grabs his Pokemon from the wrong spot.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "2012", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Slike", "publishers": "", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/EL4i7oA7OpY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/123884\n"}
