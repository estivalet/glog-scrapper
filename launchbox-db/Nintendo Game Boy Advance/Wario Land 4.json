{"name": "Wario Land 4", "overview": "Hey! You! Yeah, you! Listen up when Wario's talking to you! I just read about this legendary Pyramid of Gold, and you're gonna help me go explore it. There's lots of treasure in there for the taking, and I want it all. I'm sure there are gonna be all kinds of weird enemies and big, bad bosses in there, so if you don't think you can hack it, put the game down now. I don't want any losers making me jump into bottomless pits, you hear me?", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "August 21, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Nintendo", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.26", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wario_Land_4", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdnOeiEFrjM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/5233\n"}
