{"name": "Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories", "overview": "Kingdom Hearts comes to the Game Boy Advance with an all new battle system and story that ties straight into Kingdom Hearts II. Lured to the mysterious Castle Oblivion by a man in a black robe; Sora, Donald Duck and Goofy are stripped of their powers and abilities which are transformed into cards. With the promise of reunion with their lost friends Riku and King Mickey enticing them, our heroes resolve to climb to the top of the castle and face whatever lies in their way. But it won't be easy as each floor of the castle is accessed by a card that consists of memories of their past adventures and populated with friends and foes alike, foes that can only be fought with the power of Castle Oblivion's cards. With the rules of battle suddenly changed, this castle may be Sora, Donald, and Goofy's most perilous adventure yet. But what does the man in black want with Sora? Why is Sora suddenly remembering a girl in white? And just what happened to Riku and King Mickey to begin with?", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "November 11, 2004", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Jupiter Corporation", "publishers": "Square Enix", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.7", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_Hearts:_Chain_of_Memories", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D38FrDB-Eso", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2213\n"}
