{"name": "Pong Fighter", "overview": "The game is based on the classic Pong, if you have never played it before where have you been for the last couple of decades? \ud83d\ude42 Basically think of Pong as a game of Tennis, you control the racket and must return the ball to your opponents half of the court. If you miss the ball you will loose a point. However in this version to keep in tune with the Street Fighter theme you will loose a portion of your energy \u2013 no energy = game over. Players can now also launch fireballs at their opponent which if properly timed will stun them for a few vital seconds which could make them miss the ball.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "November 12, 2007", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "GUYFAWKS", "publishers": "", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "https://pdroms.de/files/gameboyadvance/pong-fighter-v1-2", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/114823\n"}
