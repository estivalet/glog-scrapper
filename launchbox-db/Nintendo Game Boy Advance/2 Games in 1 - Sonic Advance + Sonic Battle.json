{"name": "2 Games in 1: Sonic Advance + Sonic Battle", "overview": "This double pack has two Sonic GBA games combined on one cartridge: In Sonic Advance, the evil Dr Eggman is at it again, with a brand new scheme to trip up Sonic and his pals. Manoeuvre your way through obstacles, traps and puzzles to collect the Chaos Emeralds and defeat the vile Dr Eggman before it's too late. Sonic Battle brings furious combat action to the Game Boy Advance, as Sonic and his friends set out to determine which one of them is really the best fighter! Choose from eight characters such as Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Choose the arena, set the rules, customise your special attacks, and then engage in non-stop battles. With three types of special attacks, as well as Ground, Aerial, and Defence fighting techniques, you can customise your character to suit your fighting style. You'll also need to strategically plan and execute your attacks to take full advantage of each character's unique abilities. Up to four friends can link their systems together using the Game Boy Advance Game Link cable for team battles, and then combine special attacks into devastating combos! If you prefer to battle solo, work through the Story Mode to develop your own AI fighting partner. Either way, Sonic Battle is the ultimate showdown between Sonic and his friends.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "November 11, 2005", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dimps Corporation", "publishers": "THQ Entertainment GmbH", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.57", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/122758\n"}
