{"name": "Rhythm Tengoku", "overview": "Rhythm Tengoku is a music game based around good timing and rhythm. The game has music supplied by the record production company J.P. ROOM, and is developed by the team responsible for Wario Ware. This is visible in the quirky presentation of the game. As with Wario Ware, the game is actually a series of shorter games bundled into one package. Before each game starts, you are presented with a short tutorial that gets you ready and practice before you begin the real thing. Control is normally very simple - usually, only the A Button is required, but some games make players press multiple buttons for different actions. Players will punch in time with a karate expert as pots and rocks are thrown; pluck hairs off of an onion; march in time to an instructor; hit a baseball while the screen zooms in and out; shoot ghosts with arrows; chop demons as a samurai; and much more. At the end of each set of stages is a 'remix stage' - in this stage, sections of the previously played stages are combined and thrown at you at random, all while a single song plays.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "August 3, 2006", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "J.P.
