{"name": "Mario vs. Donkey Kong", "overview": "After years of apparent goodwill, Mario and Donkey Kong are at it again--this time, on Game Boy Advance. Donkey Kong has stolen all the Mini-Mario toys from the Mario Toy Co., and now it's up to Mario to hunt down his longtime nemesis and retrieve the pilfered goods. As Mario, you must race through challenging levels while finding keys and releasing Mini Marios before time runs out. Along the way, you'll master new moves that can help you overcome new puzzles.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "May 24, 2004", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Nintendo", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.16", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_vs._Donkey_Kong#Mario_vs._Donkey_Kong", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVJ0bsFXhXY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6396\n"}
