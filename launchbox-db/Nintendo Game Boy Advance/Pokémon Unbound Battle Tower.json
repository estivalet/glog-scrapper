{"name": "Pok\u00e9mon Unbound Battle Tower", "overview": "Introduction: As of now, there are two versions available for Pokemon Unbound. The first, a slightly older version, contains content up to just past the second Gym. If you are more of a casual Pokemon player, then this is the version I'd recommend for you. The second, a relatively newer version, showcases Unbound's new battle engine by granting unrestricted access to the Battle Frontier. This version was created in the format of a mobile game; meaning daily rewards, monthly distributions, and unlimited playtime. If you enjoy battling, then you'll find no shortage of things to do with the over 100 different possible battle combinations. With that being said, enjoy Pokemon Unbound! Story: Welcome to the Borrius Region, a region rich in history. Many years ago the Borrius region fought a brutal war with the Kalos region. The people of the Borrius region summoned a dark force to help them defeat their enemies; however the war ended in defeat when the king of the Kalos region unleashed the ultimate weapon. With the war over, the dark force was sealed away never to be used again. However, many years later, an organization known simply as \u201cThe Shadows\u201d seems bent on releasing the dark force once again. It\u2019s up to you to stop them and save the Borrius region from ultimate destruction. Features: \u25b2 Updated Graphics: All of the Fire Red graphics have been updated to Gen IV styled graphics.
