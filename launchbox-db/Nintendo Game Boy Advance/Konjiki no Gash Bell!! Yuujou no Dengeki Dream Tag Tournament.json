{"name": "Konjiki no Gash Bell!! Yuujou no Dengeki Dream Tag Tournament", "overview": "Konjiki no Gash Bell!! Unare! Y\u016bj\u014d no Zakeru Dream Tag Tournament (translated Golden Gash Bell!! Wish! Electric Shock of Friendship Dream Tag Tournament) is a 2D fighting game and a sequel to Konjiki no Gashbell: Unare Yuujou no Zakeru 2. It was released on the Game Boy Advance on November 24, 2005 in Japan only. This installment quite changes the style of play with respect to its predecessors who used a pair of humans and suckers fighting together. Instead, he uses a more traditional one-on-one system, where mamodos fight alone and their human companions can be briefly invoked to assist in a special attack. The biggest novelty of the game is that the player chooses two different mamodos to form a dream team and fight against two enemy mamodos. However, they do not fight together and cannot be exchanged during the fight and can only be exchanged at the end of the round. Even so, inactive mamodos can be invoked just like human partners for fleeting assistance. The game features - 18 Playable Characters - Thunder Class Tournament (This Game's Story Mode) - Dream Match Tournament (This Game's Arcade Mode) - Free Battle - 2 Player Versus - Training Mode - 4 Mini-Games - Collectables", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "November 24, 2005", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Banpresto", "publishers": "Namco Bandai / Banpresto", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKWD1O0Bja0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/117841\n"}
