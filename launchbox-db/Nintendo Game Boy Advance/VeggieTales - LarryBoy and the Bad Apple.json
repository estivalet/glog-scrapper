{"name": "VeggieTales: LarryBoy and the Bad Apple", "overview": "The action-adventure game features LarryBoy, the popular plunger-headed crime-fighting cucumber featured in several best-selling videos, in his quest to save the citizens of Bumblyburg from temptation. When trouble appears, the citizens of Bumblyburg call world-famous crime fighter LarryBoy! Aided only by his trusted butler Alfred (played with zest by Archibald Asparagus), LarryBoy is everything that his alter-ego Larry the Cucumber is not: bold... confident... relentlessly driven... brazenly heroic! Well, actually, that's not entirely true. While he tries to create this impression, inside, LarryBoy is still plain-old Larry. LarryBoy attempts to save the day with clever use of his super-suction ears and the many features of the Larry-Mobile. Call him a kinder, gentler, slightly slower superhero!", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "August 1, 2006", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "DC Studios", "publishers": "Crave Entertainment", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZKqRJjbsW0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/28093\n"}
