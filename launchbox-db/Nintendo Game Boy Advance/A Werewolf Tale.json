{"name": "A Werewolf Tale", "overview": "A Werewolf Tale is another fantastic Game Boy Advance homebrew game by the developer of two other fantastic homebrew GBA games, Holy Hell and .PowerPig. A Werewolf Tale differs a lot from his previous two games, its designed with the idea of being incredibly hard to complete, so expect to be defeated time after time. The game is sort of a beat-em-up styled game where you run along the walls and have to defeat creatures. Though you have to be careful as those creatures do an awful lot of damage. The developer personally describes it as a game that would fit into the metroidvania genre. But then also goes on to say that its close to popular action puzzle games like N+ and VVVVVV", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.12", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4zuWGkucGg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/140799\n"}
