{"name": "Celeste Classic", "overview": "Celeste Classic is the prototype of the hit indie game Celeste. It's a difficult platforming game that demands precise wall jumps and air dashes. I've ported it to one of my favorite consoles: the Game Boy Advance! Now it can be played on not only the GBA, but anything else with a GBA emulator. It's almost a direct conversion with minor graphical alterations.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "2019", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Matt Thorson", "publishers": "", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.7", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/127929\n"}
