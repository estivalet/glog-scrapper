{"name": "Pok\u00e9mon Dark Rising II", "overview": "STORY: The sequel to Dark Rising 1. This hack continues the story of you trying to rescue your father, releasing Arceus from it's sealed chamber, and defeating the dark entity known as Darugis. The Adventure Continues... You, the player, wake up from a sudden dream you had in the region known as Core, where you live. In the dream, a Pokemon told you of a dark force that has begun its reawakening & asks for your aid in stopping it from causing chaos upon the world. You soon discovered that your best friend also had the same dream as well. After helping your town's professor, you set out on your own adventure paired with your Dragon-Type Pokemon with many unanswered questions in your mind. What is Darugis, the dark force the Pokemon spoke of? Along your journey, you discover Darugis can control the minds of people and Pokemon alike. You meet a man named V, who was a former assistant of your father, who Darugis now has captured along with the Pokemon from your dream. As your journey continued, you met many enemies, some who became rivals, and even friends. Sydney, a young woman who watched Darugis' reawakening cause the death of her family and her village. Dray, a strong-willed Pokemon trainer who's father assisted your father in defeating Darugis years ago. And Florina, another strong trainer with a genius mind when it comes to technology. Together, along with your childhood friend, Pete, as well as assistance from a once enemy, Kayo, defeated Adrian, the champion of the Omni Region who happened to be one of Darugis' main puppets. Though this time, you've grown to become a very strong Pokemon trainer, even battling the likes of Ash Ketchum himself, the world's greatest trainer. You've also gained the ability to connect and bond with Legendary Pokemon. As some questions became clear with answers, more begin to grow in your mind. For example, what is the true connection between the 3 Chosen Ones? You have the power to Bond and communicate with Pokemon. A young man known as Light has the power to create Pokemon through energy. And your best friend, the 3rd Chosen One, what is his ability? There's still so much unanswered... Now, You and the rest of your friends(Team Dark Rising) have set off to the Omni Region in search of Darugis & saving your father. Three days have passed since the events at Malice Castle...The team has changed their gear and left all traces of events within the Core Region behind them, including their Pokemon(Except their Dragons).
