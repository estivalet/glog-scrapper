Obstacles, jumps and opposing racers bring the world and the races to life. Unlock new environments as you progress and upgrade your skates with the money you earn. How are your wheels? Do you need to patch up those injuries with a health boost; can you afford those dream speed skates? All these will change as you progress, keeping interest in the game alive. Wheels can also be tweaked to give emphasis on speed increase & stability or maneuverability & instability, giving the player an advantage against other competitors.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "March 30, 2003", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "The Code Monkeys", "publishers": "Crave Entertainment", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFl-viOa4lU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/26414\n"}
