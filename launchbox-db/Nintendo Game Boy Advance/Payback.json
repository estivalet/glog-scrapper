{"name": "Payback", "overview": "If you'd always wondered what it would be like to be a master criminal, then Payback is the game for you. It's entirely non-linear - to complete a level you simply have to obtain a certain number of points - how you get those points is entirely up to you; you can do what the local kingpin tells you, uncover secret missions or just go on a mad killing spree. This GBA action game takes inspirations from Rockstar/DMA's classic GTA series, but features unique gameplay elements, plus a visually stunning 3D GBA engine full of special effects and a smooth framerate.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "November 19, 2004", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Apex Designs", "publishers": "DSI Games", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.8", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/18851\n"}
