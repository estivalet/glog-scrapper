{"name": "Mario Kart: Super Circuit", "overview": "Whoever hands out driver's licenses in the Mushroom Kingdom is about to be in some serious trouble. Classic Mario Kart action is back once again, this time in a colorful, lightning-fast game that you can take anywhere. Mario, Luigi, Peach, Toad, Wario, Yoshi, and Bowser are all tearing up the track, tossing Koopa Shells and laying banana peels along the way. Mario Kart: Super Circuit puts your driving skills to the test on 40 tracks, each littered with wild weapons and obstacles. Four players can compete in Mario Kart: Super Circuit using only one Game Pak. If each player has a copy of the game, bonus features and new modes of play become available.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "August 27, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Intelligent Systems", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.18", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Kart:_Super_Circuit", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQBQRcC20ks", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/8375\n"}
