{"name": "2 Games in 1: Monsters, Inc. / Finding Nemo", "overview": "The Game Boy Advance version of Finding Nemo adapts the Pixar film as a side-scrolling action game with light puzzle and exploration elements. The game's 12 levels follow the plot of the film. Depending on the level, the player either controls clownfish Marlin or his son Nemo. Goals in the levels might include simply finding the exit, finding certain characters or items, reaching a certain point within a time limit, or simple survival, like when Marlin and his friend Dory are chased by Bruce the shark. The levels are full of unfriendly sea creatures that shouldn't be touched and environmental hazards like strong currents. Simple puzzle solutions are used to get around some obstacles, like dropping a pearl into on oyster for it to close, pushing a piece of rock on a hole to block a current or flipping switches to open barriers. In Monster's Inc Boo has returned to Monstropolis and it is your job as Sulley to get her back home. However, to make things difficult, Randal has destroyed her door. Avoid Randall and the CDA (Child Detection Agency) as well as other dangers as you try getting Boo home. This platform scroller will have you trying to find out where you have been as you make your way through multiple doorways, up and down ladders, and more. Pick up items along the way as you jump and dodge enemies, use your roar attack, push items, sneak, and more. The game includes a random map generator so every game is different as you play in three difficulty levels.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "June 8, 2005", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Vicarious Visions", "publishers": "THQ", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/116553\n"}
