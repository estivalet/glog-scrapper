{"name": "Shining Soul II", "overview": "As monsters begin to appear in the kingdom Klantol, King Marcel announces a grand tournament at the coliseum to find a hero that can protect the country. Now, as a mighty Brawler, Priestess, Dark Wizard, or Ninja, you must accept the king's challenge. Each character has certain strengths and weaknesses that can mean the difference between victory and defeat in single-player, multiplayer, or cooperative multiplayer modes. In addition to valuable weapons and armor, you can equip your party with Force Links, which, when combined, create a Shining Force--a powerful weapon capable of decimating the enemy forces.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "April 20, 2004", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Grasshopper Manufacture", "publishers": "Atlus", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.37", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shining_Soul_II", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/11171\n"}
