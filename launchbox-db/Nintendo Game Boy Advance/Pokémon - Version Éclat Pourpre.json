{"name": "Pok\u00e9mon: Version E\u0301clat Pourpre", "overview": "The region is overwhelmed by a wave of crime. An organization by the name of TEAM ROCKET carries out mass kidnappings of Pok\u00e9mon, creating unprecedented panic. The police forces are doing all they can to put an end to this period of repression, but the organization of criminals is such that it is insufficient. Some trainers therefore decide to face TEAM ROCKET on their own, but without real success either, and this despite the success of some in thwarting some plans of the organization. Thus, to strengthen trainers and to avoid centralizing Pok\u00e9mon in laboratories or centers, a measure has been put in place, consisting in equipping all trainers deemed able to fight a Pok\u00e9mon to defend themselves. Will this be enough to end the period of turmoil in the region ?", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "2015", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mickey", "publishers": "", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151383\n"}
