The game features an extensive word list based on the official Scrabble word list, 10 ability levels, the ability to customize the game to suit your own preferences, and single- and multiplayer game modes that let up to four Scrabble fans go head-to-head against each other.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "April 12, 2005", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Runecraft", "publishers": "Ubisoft", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/26449\n"}
