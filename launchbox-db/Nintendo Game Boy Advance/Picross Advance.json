{"name": "Picross Advance", "overview": "In picross you must use the numbers above the columns and beside the rows or you're not going to get far at all. The clues beside the rows are read from left to right, so 1 2 3 means that there is one block [maybe space before it], then some space and two blocks in a row, followed by some more space and three blocks in a row [perhaps with more space beyond them]. Similarly the clues above the columns are red from top to bottom and correspond to chiseled blocks from top to bottom.
