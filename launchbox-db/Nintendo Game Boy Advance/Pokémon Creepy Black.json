{"name": "Pok\u00e9mon Creepy Black", "overview": "Description: Upon booting up the game, you can see the normal introduction of Pokemon Fire Red with Nidorino and Gengar. After choosing New Game and viewing Professor Oak\u2019s unusual speech, you will see another unusual thing: there is a Pokemon called Ghost in your party. Later on, you will face the most creepy part of this game. When using the Ghost Pokemon to battle, your opponents cannot move. There is only a move named Curse in your Fight menu. Choose it, your screen will turn to black. Then, you may hear the cry of that opponent but in a very much lower pitch and it has been distorted. The battle screen will be back again, but there is no Pokemon at your opponent\u2019s side. Well then, the Pokemon was dead. You see: \"DEAD!\" What\u2019s even stranger is after using the Curse move on any trainer you face, the sprites of trainer is gone. Instead, a tombstone like the ones at Lavender Tower is placed where that trainer stood! You can feel a terrible, scary atmosphere with the infinite loop of the soundtrack Lavender Town. This is the main music of this version, so you cannot change anything unless you turn off the volume. Prepare to sense and feel the mysteries of darkness and death in this game. What will happen at the end? Nobody has come back alive to tell the tale.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "2012", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Creepy", "publishers": "", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/bm0uCyY70Qk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/123417\n"}
