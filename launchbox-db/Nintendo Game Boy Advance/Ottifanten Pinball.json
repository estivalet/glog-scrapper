{"name": "Ottifanten Pinball", "overview": "As the title says, it is a pinball game featuring the Ottifants, which are comic characters created by the German comedian Otto Waalkes. The game consists of two tables, \"city\" and \"coast\", which are displayed in a top-down perspective like in Pinball Dreams. There are no options available, like changing the number of balls for example. Apart from using Waalkes' characters, some of the sound effects are samples from Waalkes' shows and in the menus, the game plays audio extracts from old shows instead of music.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "December 15, 2005", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Independent Arts", "publishers": "Trend Verlag", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/118139\n"}
