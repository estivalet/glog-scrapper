{"name": "Pac-Man World", "overview": "Unlike most \"Pac-games,\" Pac-Man World is a platform-adventure in which the round, yellow hero progresses through over 20 levels of action. He still faces opposition, however, from ghostly nemeses like Inky, Blinky, Pinky, and Clyde. He must also run, jump, and swim his way past other malevolent creatures, such as skeletons, spiders, and killer fish. Thankfully, Pac-Man has a variety of attack methods. Excluding ghosts, most baddies are susceptible to projectile \"Pac-Dots,\" the \"Ultra Butt-Bounce\" (which also helps him jump higher), or the \"Rev Roll,\" a speed burst allowing Pac-Man to make lengthy jumps off ramps. When disposing of ghosts though, he must first ingest a good old-fashioned Power Pellet, then devour them before its effects wear off.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "November 17, 2004", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Namco", "publishers": "Namco", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man_World", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/5228\n"}
