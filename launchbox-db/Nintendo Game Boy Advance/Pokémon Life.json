{"name": "Pok\u00e9mon Life", "overview": "Your story... Yours is not an average, simple story; yours is a story spanning many dimensions of reality, exploring the very idea of life itself. Generally, you consider your concepts of reality to be accurate... They're not. Reality is unstable. All you really know is that time is running and the Earth is spinning. You are one in seven billion like you, but you are still different. On your island, Nendios, you dream the same dream that all young trainers like yourself do -- to triumph over the Elite Four, conquering independence... But there's more to the journey ahead than you could ever know. Again, there are seven billion like you -- unfortunately, however, only a handful are as pure. Many will try to manipulate you and anyone similarly pure; to use you to their own ends or even to simply impede your progress out of envy. You must take heed of this. Life, the world, and the people within -- they are all unpredictable, despite what some may think. Certainly, stride forth -- just be cautious.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dionen", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/105579\n"}
