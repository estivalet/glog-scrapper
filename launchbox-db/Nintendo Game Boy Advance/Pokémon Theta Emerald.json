{"name": "Pok\u00e9mon Theta Emerald", "overview": "This is a project that I have been working on for almost a year, and now I can finally say that this game is ready for a release. This is completely different from the regular Emerald game you are used to. However, it is different, in a very fun and cool way :) Features: 650 Pok\u00e9mon: This may not be the first Emerald sideshow game to have more Pok\u00e9mon than just 386, but, as of May 2015, this is the Emerald sideshow game with the most Pok\u00e9mon to catch. Not only that, but every single one of them is catchable, either through an event, or in the wild. Not only that, but the Trainers, Gym Leaders, Evil Teams, Elite Four, and Champion have new Pok\u00e9mon as well. 100+ new moves: In order to compensate with the new Pok\u00e9mon, there has been quite a few new moves added to game to add to everyone's movesets. Some with new animations, and some with new effects. Physical/Special Split: To make the game more current, a proper Physical/Special Split has been implemented to the game, including icons to denote each move. \"Have Specific Pok\u00e9mon\" Events: In order to encounter certain Pok\u00e9mon, or more specifically, legendary Pok\u00e9mon, you must have one to three Pok\u00e9mon in your party in order for the event to work. Fairy-type: Yes, the Fairy-type that has been shown in Pok\u00e9mon X & Y, has been added to the game. Updated Stats: Also, Pok\u00e9mon that got their stats updated in X & Y now have them updated in this game. New Evolution Methods: Pok\u00e9mon that evolved through trade have a different means of evolving. Not only that, but because of the new Pok\u00e9mon, completely new evolution methods have been added, like Map Name Evolution, Move Evolution, etc. That, and three new evolution items have been added. The Dawn Stone and Dusk Stone from Diamond and Pearl, and the Link Cable from Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon. Running Shoes Update: Like the newer generation games, you can use the running shoes to run inside of buildings. Reusable TMs: Introduced in Pok\u00e9mon Black & White, TMs can be used as many times as you like. Egg Hatching Level: The levels of eggs that hatch are now at Level 1, just like in the newer games. Catch EXP: A mechanic introduced in X & Y, now when you capture a Pok\u00e9mon, your Pok\u00e9mon will gain EXP. De-capitalization: NO MORE OF THIS. Maybe a few spots, but I'll fix them as time goes on.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "May 20, 2015", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "LCCoolJ95", "publishers": "LCCoolJ95", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90878\n"}
