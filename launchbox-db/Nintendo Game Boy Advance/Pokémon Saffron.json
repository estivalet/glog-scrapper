{"name": "Pok\u00e9mon Saffron", "overview": "Azira is a dense region in South America that is home to many species of Pok\u00e9mon while they migrate across the globe. Once every decade, a majority of the migration paths sync up and cause the region's Pok\u00e9mon population to skyrocket! This event is known as the Great Migration. Trainers, gym leaders, professors, and adventurers come from far and wide to experience this grand event. Your family is from the Hoenn region, where your brother ventured out to become a Pok\u00e9mon master! Now it is your turn. You and your mother have moved to Haba island, a small landmass located just off the coast of the mainland. Upon arriving, Professor Oak recruits you to help him with his studies. He believes the migration paths are directly related to the behavior of legendary and mythical Pok\u00e9mon, and needs your help to collect data for his research on this phenomena. Explore Azira while you discover the secret to the migration routes, uncover Team Rocket's nefarious plan, and encounter some familiar faces along the way!
