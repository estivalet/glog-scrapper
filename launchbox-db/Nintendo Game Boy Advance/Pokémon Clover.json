{"name": "Pok\u00e9mon Clover", "overview": "ABOUT: Pok\u00e9mon Clover is a ROM Hack of Pok\u00e9mon Fire Red featuring the two brand new regions of Fochun and the Ebin Isles, as well as 386 original fakemon! Started in 2015 as a janky rehash of the base game, Pok\u00e9mon Clover has since evolved into a complete overhaul with all-new characters, story, maps, and music. The main point of Clover is to be both a parody of 4chan\u2019s imageboard culture as well as a parody of Pok\u00e9mon as a whole, thus it contains themes and language not suited for the faint of heart. STORY: Pok\u00e9mon Clover\u2019s story follows a young Trainer from Veepier Town in the Fochun region as they get their starter from Professor Stump and go on a good old fashioned Badge-collecting journey, and battle the nefarious Team Karma, a mysterious group supposedly hunting for the most powerful meme in the world.
