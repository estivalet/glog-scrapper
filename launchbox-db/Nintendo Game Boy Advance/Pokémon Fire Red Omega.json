{"name": "Pok\u00e9mon Fire Red Omega", "overview": "Pokemon Fire Red Omega is a hack of Pokemon Fire Red with numerous significant changes to make the game an intriguing and sophisticated experience for knowledgeable players. The first and most obvious change is the sheer volume of available Pokemon-- over 30 are available just in the opening routes/Viridian forest, and all 389 are incorporated into the game. Furthermore, evolution stones are easily accessed earlier and trade-evolution Pokemon instead evolve by level up, making everything fair game. Wild Pokemon (and trainers) all tend to be at higher levels too, and your Pokemon grow quickly as a result. But, you're going to need all the extra strength you can get-- because the battles are real challenges. All the gym leaders have 6 Pokemon, and they are TOUGH. You can't just catch a grass and expect to beat Brock when Rhyhorn uses Flamethrower and OHKO's your Shroomish. You can't expect Nidoking or Diglett to win you the match against Surge when Raichu outspeeds and OHKOes you with Surf. Because of the sheer challenge of bosses, not all Pokemon can be useful throughout the entire game-- you can't just keep grinding an early game Pokemon and expect to come out on top. Also with the high availability of high level and powerful teammates, switching the team up partway through becomes a real considerable strategy. You can't just think to rely on old R/B favorites like Nidoqueen and Snorlax and expect to walk through the game! It's a frontier where we Poke nerds can really be put to the test!", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "2009", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147826\n"}
