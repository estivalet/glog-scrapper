{"name": "The Legend Of Zelda : Sacred Paradox", "overview": "The goal of this game is to fully replace the Pokemon experience with a Zelda experience similar to the Gameboy Zelda games. You will play as Link as you journey through a familiar yet new version of Hyrule... as a monster tamer. The battle mechanics of Pokemon will take over for this game, as you collect and capture creatures inside of Soul Gems. Gyms are out of the equation, as now you must complete dungeons by solving puzzles and capturing or defeating bosses and minibosses. Many characters from all around the Zelda timelines will make an appearance in this game, making this a fanservice fangame. The \"Sacred Paradox\" itself will stem from a villain capturing Zelda and entering the Sacred Realm to create an altered world to rule over, bending reality to fuse two worlds into one. Link must defeat this villain to rescue Princess Zelda and save Hyrule!", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "November 14, 2016", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Meowth", "publishers": "", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.86", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/z2chHJ109NQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/117055\n"}
