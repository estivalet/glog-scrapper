{"name": "Super Army War", "overview": "In a time of war, it's up to you to pilot your aircraft across enemy lines to attack the opposition and defend American ground troops. In the cockpit of either a chopper or fighter plane, you must lay down suppressing fire, shoot missiles at enemy bunkers, and deploy soldiers to reclaim lost territory. As you fight for your country, remember to rescue any civilians who are caught in the cross fire. See if you have what it takes to survive 16 missions over a variety of terrain, including frozen wastelands and palm tree-laden beachheads.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "February 22, 2005", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Atlus", "publishers": "Atlus", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.44", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Army_War", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mV1GjXFQl1U", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/3539\n"}
