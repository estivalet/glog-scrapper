{"name": "Countryball: Catch 'em All!", "overview": "How did it start? The idea for Countryball as a Pok\u00e9mon hack started circa 2017, when /flag/ members from /int/ stumbled upon a gif of Canadian maple leaf evolving into the flag of Norfolk island. It took a few months until they decided it would be fun to make another ROM hack, similar to /vp/s' critically-acclaimed Pok\u00e9mon Clover, with /flag/s' being centered around flag-related memes. Since then, the project has grown in size and scope, with many people from other internet communities helping and contributing. So what is it about, anyways? Set in the region of Terra, the player will set out on a quest to defeat the eight Flagmasters of the region and advance to the Flag League! But be wary, a regime of the past grows stronger every day...
