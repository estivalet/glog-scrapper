{"name": "Super Bubble Pop", "overview": "Publisher Jaleco Entertainment steps back into the gaming arena with a bubble-popping puzzle game. The quirky title, which was developed by Runecraft Software, lets players choose a character from a selection of five dancing DJs and selecting a skill level, players jump immediately into the guts of the game. The point is to maneuver the selected DJ from left to right and shoot bubbles at their colored counterparts as they slowly advance across a nine-by-nine grid. It's fairly simple stuff, but it is made slightly more complicated as three matching bubbles, be them in horizontal or vertical form, cancel each other out, award players points, and help clear the battlefield.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "January 3, 2003", "game_type": "", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Runecraft", "publishers": "Jaleco Entertainment", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21707\n"}
