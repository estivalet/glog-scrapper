{"name": "3 in 1: Rugrats: I Gotta Party / Spongebob Squarepants: Supersponge / Tak and the Power of the Juju", "overview": "The Rugrats are playing hide-and-seek in the house, and it is up to the player to find them. Doing so opens up several different minigames: cookie (and worm) catching, racing, and puzzle solving are featured in the gamut. SpongeBob wants to get a autographed photo of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy for his friend Patrick for a birthday present. The two elderly superheroes want nothing to do with SpongeBob and instead sent him to find random objects around Bikini Bottom. There is a prophecy that speaks of a Legendary Warrior, and it says that he would restore the Moon Juju, defeat Tlaloc and bring peace to the Pupanunu people. Tak and Lok are both apprentices of Jibolba, Tak being the younger of the two, but after Lok is turned into a sheep, it's Tak's turn to take the quest of restoring his friend to his human form.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "November 25, 2005", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Climax Studios", "publishers": "THQ Inc.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.42", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/122846\n"}
