{"name": "Pok\u00e9mon Emerald Double Version", "overview": "About: Pokemon Emerald, but every trainer battle is a double battle. Yup, inspired by Colosseum and XD, every trainer battle will be changed to a double battle! There is also increased difficulty and level curve! Features: \u2022 Double battles everywhere! Every trainer completely reworked, with interesting (but still theme-consistent) teams, using a much greater variety of Pokemon! \u2022 Double wild battles in almost every location! (Except the water. Oh.) \u2022 A steeper level curve, to make the games a fresh challenge. Expect level 40s by the 4th Gym! \u2022 Emerald Battle Engine Upgrade- Physical/Special split, Fairy type, up-to-date moves/abilities/learnsets and more \u2022 Super tough main-character battles that challenge you with advanced moves and techniques, from Gym Leaders, your rival and Maxie/Archie! \u2022 An extra starter, Eevee, with methods provided early on to evolve, including Umbreon and Espeon! \u2022 TMs, especially double-centric moves, are now available early on in Pokemarts, and are now infinite use \u2022 General avoidance of HM requirements except Surf, Dive and Waterfall (7.8 too much water), especially in the late game \u2022 Rematches with Gym leaders have been enhanced for the post-game, and you can find Maxie and Archie... somewhere! \u2022 386 obtainable Pokemon (breeding/evolving still required). \u2022 Secret extras! Known bugs: \u2022 U-turn does not work! To do with the battle engine, cannot fix. Please save often! \u2022 When you enter a double battle with only one Pokemon (in your party or not-fainted), the game will either clone your only Pokemon or bring a fainted Pokemon into the battle (who can't attack or gain EXP). Finishing the battle will enable normal progression \u2022 The bag sprites are glitched permanently. Cosmetic only. \u2022 When fighting a single trainer, if both you and your opponent lose a Mon, then when you put your replacement in, it says \"enemy trainer sent out your Pokemon.\" \u2022 Not all normal rematches are in. Okay, not a bug, and something I might change one day, but not for now.
