{"name": "Crash Bandicoot: The Huge Adventure", "overview": "Tired of endlessly doing battle with meddling bandicoots, the nefarious Dr. Neo Cortex shrinks the entire Earth, and Crash and Coco along with it, to the size of a wumpa fruit. Luckily, Coco invents a machine to reverse the effects, but she needs crystals from around the world to power it. Crash must retrieve the crystals to help return the entire planet to its natural state. Experience Crash's biggest adventure yet, with gameplay modes ranging from side-scrolling to 3D chase levels to aerial dogfight combat sequences. Battle your way through over 20 huge levels and six unique locations to defeat Cortex and save the world.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "February 28, 2002", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Vicarious Visions", "publishers": "Universal Interactive", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.94", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crash_Bandicoot:_The_Huge_Adventure", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdZ-BFRbmOU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/3193\n"}
