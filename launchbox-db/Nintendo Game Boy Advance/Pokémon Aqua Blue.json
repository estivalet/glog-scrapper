{"name": "Pok\u00e9mon Aqua Blue", "overview": "Story: This takes place after the events of Fire Red. You are an average kid living in Saffron City. You're looking forward to your first ever Pok\u00e9mon coming in through an ordering service, and after several weeks of waiting the day has finally arrived! Professor Oak contacts your mother and prepares to meet you in the Saffron City Pokecenter. However, when you arrive, things don't quite go as planned. During your visit at the Pok\u00e9center, a meteor crashes into Silph. Co.! Before you know it, you're hurled into an adventure larger than you're prepared for. Upon arriving at Silph. Co., you find nothing but rubble and three mysterious figures who later reveal themselves to be Team Rocket. When things take a turn for the worst, you're forced to battle with them, and you find out the Pok\u00e9mon you ordered was shiny! Despite your victory, they manage to steal the meteor. After a heated battle you black out only to wake up back in your home, being greeted by Professor Oak and your mother.
