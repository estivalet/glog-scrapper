{"name": "Pok\u00e9mon Verde Musgo", "overview": "With the Pokemon Verde Musgo Game, players are brought inside the world of Pokemon, but in a new and exciting way. Players are going to be challenged to find their way through this new world to collect all their favorite Pokemon in a way that only Pokemon could. The game is a mix between a puzzle and a platformer. There is a lot of work that goes into designing a game, and this next game from Pokemon is proof of that. It is a free game to play with no in-app purchases. The goal is to evolve the game by defeating gym leaders and gyms, becoming the best Pokemon trainer, and catching all the Pokemon. There are three game modes, a story mode, time mode, and battle mode. The story mode is where the player meets and battles with characters from the show. The time mode is where the player battles other players and the game uses a time limit. Battle mode is where players can battle gym leaders and gyms. Pokemon Verde Musgo is a new game that is currently in development. It is a role-playing game that takes place in the Sinnoh region. The game will have a new type of Pokemon called the Murkrow, which was not in previous games. There will also be a new battle system where players can use items and battle tactics to win.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Purple Brothers", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162709\n"}
