{"name": "Pitfall: The Lost Expedition", "overview": "Deep in the Peruvian Jungle, assume the role of Activision's classic platform hero, Pitfall Harry, a fearless, rough-and-ready treasure seeker who battles evil using his athletic ability and a knapsack filled with adventure gear. Harry competes against a rival explorer to find hidden treasures. The game features over lots of perilous levels, including lush rain forests, creature-ridden caves and vast glacial mountains. Players cross treacherous jungle terrain and dark areas filled with puzzles, tricks and traps, and -- true to the series -- swing on vines, avoid crocodiles and dodge rolling logs as they unearth artifacts and use their cunning to defeat dangerous foes.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "February 18, 2004", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Torus Games", "publishers": "Activision", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.28", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7f7FFZq_nI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/3362\n"}
