{"name": "Sonic the Hedgehog: Genesis", "overview": "In honor of its beloved mascot's 15th birthday, SEGA brings the game that started it all to GBA Sonic The Hedgehog. The game will feature two new additions to the classic 1991 debut, including Sonic's famous Spin-Dash move and a new save ability. Burst the videgame speed barrier wide-open with Sonic the Hedgehog. Blaze by in a blur using the super sonic spin attack. Loop the loop by defying gravity. Plummet down tunnels. Then dash to safety with Sonic's power sneakers. All at a frenzied pace. Sonic has an attitude that just won't quit!", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "November 14, 2006", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Sonic Team", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.76", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/20604\n"}
