There are five modes in the game: Destroy All Enemies: the player must destroy a set number of enemies in one of the two types of battle: Floodgate (with statues that spawn new enemies until destroyed) or Timed battle (all enemies must be destroyed in a set number of moves). Pursuit: the player must chase down and destroy a demon before it reaches a certain spot on the map. Timed Destination: the player must guide at least one member of the team to a designated square on the map, with demons trying to stop him. Timed Floodgate: the player must wait a set amount of time on a square on the map until the floodgates are destroyed; afterwards, the player must destroy the remaining demons.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Advance", "release_date": "November 18, 2004", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Sensory Sweep Studios", "publishers": "Atari", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.07", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yu_Yu_Hakusho:_Tournament_Tactics", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5xs8GBiNTA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/3933\n"}
