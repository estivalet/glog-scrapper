{"name": "The Enforcer", "overview": "Your job is to gun down dozens of bad guys as they pop up from beind trash cans (that's American dustbins), peer out of windows. The game is played Operation Wolf style, though the screen won't move - you have to kill a pre-determined number of goons before you can progress any further down the street. There are also nice little bonus levels in between locations, involving loads of bottles of booze and some blokeys trying frantically to pack it. Your job here is to shoot the whiskey before it gets packed.", "platform": "Amstrad GX4000", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Trojan", "publishers": "Trojan", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/77432"}
