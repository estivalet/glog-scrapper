{"name": "Tree of Knowledge", "overview": "The Tree Of Knowledge is an interactive program which teaches categorization. The student first educates the computer about a particular group of objects - for example, plants or birds. The database, or 'tree' created in this way is then used to play guessing games in which the student thinks of an object and the computer works out what it is. Databases are saved and loaded from within the program and two sample databases are supplied on the ROM Cartridge.", "platform": "Acorn Electron", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Acornsoft", "publishers": "Acornsoft", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/81641"}
