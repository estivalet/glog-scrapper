{"name": "Frak!", "overview": "The Scrubblies and their friends have put all the special keys in hard-to-get places. Help Trogg collect all the keys, but watch out for the balloons and daggers!<br><br>If you run out of time it becomes night-time. You can continue to play in the darkness, but you can't yo-yo balloons or daggers.<br><br>There are a few things that Trogg can do that aren't obvious at first sight. If you hold the yo-yo key down, Trogg yo-yos further. If that still doesn't reach where you're trying to yo-yo, move a step or two closer (if you can) and try again. You will need to do this halfway across the first sheet and again later.<br><br>Trogg can walk past one rope and catch the next one along or walk off a platform and grab hold of the rope beside it. This is useful at the start of the fourth sheet (hold the \"Down\" key down and walk right off the log-end). If you're having jumping across gaps, go to the top of the first bit on sheet one and practise up there. You'll have Trogg leaping around in no time at all!<br><br>If you're wondering what everything does: bulbs give you more time before it goes dark, gems boost your score, and all the keys must be collected to finish each screen. Remember that Trogg has a big nose that helps get keys - although it often gets in the way!
