{"name": "The Sorceror of Claymorgue Castle", "overview": "Long ago, in times passed beyond remembrance, Solon the Master Wizard and wearer of the Secret Cloak lost the 13 Stars of Power. The grasping Vileroth believed the Stars to be the only source of Solon's expert wizardry. But, unbeknownst to Vileroth, it was the Secret Cloak that controlled the Stars and protected the wearer from their awesome powers. Unable to master the Stars, Vileroth was undone.<br><br>In his final days, as Vileroth's strength slipped from him, he concealed the thirteen Stars of Power within the Castle of Claymorgue, determined that no-one save he should possess them. Solon, learning of Vileroth's destruction, despatched his faithful young apprentice Beanwick to retrieve the Stars.<br><br>\"Tread carefully, O Beanwick! Would that I could assume this quest myself, but alas, I can only send with you these few spells. Claymorgue Castle harbours further spells, but beware - one unskilled in the arts cannot predict their outcome.\"", "platform": "Acorn Electron", "release_date": "December 1, 1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Adventure International", "publishers": "Adventure International", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/81714"}
