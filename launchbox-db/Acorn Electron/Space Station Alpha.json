{"name": "Space Station Alpha", "overview": "This game was also published by Tynesoft as Cylon Invasion.<br><br>Space Station Alpha is a shoot 'em up where the player as the commander of the last orbiting space station has to prevent a fleet of Cylon spaceships from attacking and destroying Earth. All the action takes place on a single screen and is seen from a first person perspective. The attacking ships appear one at a time from the top right corner and launch missiles towards Earth.<br>The player moves a crosshair over the screen and has to shoot down the missiles or the ships before they reach the planet. It's necessary to shoot sparingly since the weapon might otherwise overheat and thereby be out of function for a few seconds. Earth has a shield rating that decreases when hit. It starts at 9,999 and when under 1,000 the planet will start glowing red indicating a near end. When it reaches zero the planet will explode and the game will end. Enemies attack in fifty waves, getting gradually faster in each.", "platform": "Acorn Electron", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Icon", "publishers": "Icon", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73310"}
