{"name": "Killer Gorilla", "overview": "The object of the game is to climb to the top of each level as quickly as possible while avoiding the hazards. There are four levels and if you complete all four, you will go back to the first one, but there will be some extra nasties\"!<br><br>You will be given an extra life the first time you complete level 3. Extra points will be awarded if you collect the heiress's belongings on the way up (handbag, umbrella, etc.). It is possible to jump up and grab the hammers and then for a limited length of time you can smash the fireballs, barrels or bowls of custard. You cannot climb ladders or jump gaps with the hammer. You must complete each level before your bonus runs out, or you will die of exhaustion. Good luck, you will need it.", "platform": "Acorn Electron", "release_date": "May 1, 1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Micro Power", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/142974"}
