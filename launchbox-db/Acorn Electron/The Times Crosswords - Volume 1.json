{"name": "The Times Crosswords: Volume 1", "overview": "The 60 puzzles in this collection are typical of the modern Times Crossword, all having appeared in the first nine months of 1983. The only exception is the last puzzle, number 60, which was used as the Crossword Championship Eliminator Puzzle designed to reduce the qualifiers in the 1983 Championship. It is a sobering example of how fiendish crossword compilers can be if they really try, but is included as an interesting challenge to those puzzlers who refuse to be beaten.", "platform": "Acorn Electron", "release_date": "September 1, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Akom", "publishers": "Akom", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/81720"}
