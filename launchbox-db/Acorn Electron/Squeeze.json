{"name": "Squeeze", "overview": "Squeeze is a game of strategy for both children and adults. You and your opponent each have a shape. The aim of the game is to squeeze your opponent out and to put as many of your shapes onto a board as possible. There are lots of different shapes and board sizes from which to choose and three levels to master.<br><br>You are able to go from a simple movement up, down or sideways to one which turns or flips the shapes. Squeeze encourages its players to visualise and to estimate how shapes relate to each other in a given space.", "platform": "Acorn Electron", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ian Stewart", "publishers": "Acornsoft", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/82066"}
