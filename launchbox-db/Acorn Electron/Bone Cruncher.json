The levels are filled with dirt (which vanishes when Bono walks over it), monsters , and glooks (basically rocks with eyes). Monsters can only travel on ways without dirt and their touch is hazardous - some even eat up the skeletons. There are 25 skeletons to find in each level and specific steps have to worked out to reach them (e.g. using a glook to cut off a specific monster's path), giving the game a puzzle-solving character.", "platform": "Acorn Electron", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Martyn Howard", "publishers": "Superior Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/41418"}
