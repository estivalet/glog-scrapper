{"name": "Impact", "overview": "Trapped - in a 1970s arcade game! Every escape route is blocked by a wall of brightly coloured bricks. Powerfully addictive, Impact has 80 built in screens, but if you prefer you can design your own - as hard, as simple, as much fun as you like. Hidden on each screen are special tokens - catch them if you can. Use them to buy one of nine powerful weapons, or keep them until the end of the screen to score a bonus. If you thought the fun had gone out of computer games, then Impact is the game that'll change your mind!\"", "platform": "Acorn Electron", "release_date": "April 1, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gary Partis", "publishers": "Audiogenic", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-1MNSGaRbw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/82031"}
