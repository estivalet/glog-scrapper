{"name": "Graham Gooch's Test Cricket", "overview": "GRAHAM GOOCH'S TEST CRICKET is an accurate simulation of the game which allows you to stage test matches in your own living room - with the aid of your home computer.<br><br>There are two modes of operation. Simulation mode is like watching a game of cricket - once you've chosen the teams and the game is under way, you can just sit back and watch it if you like. However, you needn't just be a spectator - whether your team is batting or bowling, you can make tactical changes whenever you wish. In arcade mode, you must be alert at all times. A careless stroke or a loose over could cost the match.", "platform": "Acorn Electron", "release_date": "September 1, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Audiogenic", "publishers": "Alternative Software", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/81880"}
