{"name": "Palace of Magic", "overview": "A game along similar lines to Citadel. Using over a hundred individual screens, this great platform adventure has you playing a guy who spends most of his time finding keys, solving puzzles, opening doors, and bribing wizards! This game was tougher than Citadel, with some downright frustrating screens and puzzles. The graphics are similar, but perhaps slightly better than Citadel, with better sprite resolution.", "platform": "Acorn Electron", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Martyn Howard", "publishers": "Superior Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73226"}
