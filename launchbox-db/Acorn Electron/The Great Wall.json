{"name": "The Great Wall", "overview": "As a Roman Army runner you have been ordered into training by your Commander. Your training could prove to be very hazardous, if not deadly!\"<br><br>In the days of old, army commanders required \"runners\" to keep in touch with their headquarters. You have been chosen to train for this dangerous occupation.<br><br>The training consists of running along the top of the great wall that divides two waring nations. Sounds easy? It's not. You will encounter many hazards and obstacles along the way. Some of the obstacles you will meet are: rocks, arrows, unpleasant guards and fast moving cannon balls. There are other hazards; these you will find out for yourself. Contact with any of the obstacles will result in the loss of one of your lives, remember you only have four, don't waste any.<br><br>Your performance is assessed by how quickly you manage to cross each section of wall, if you run out of time you will forfeit a life. There are eight levels to conquer, each level contains sixty four sections, a total of five hundred and twelve sections, not a task for the faint of heart.<br><br>At the end of your trial you can enter your name on the roll of honour if you're good enough, accompanied by a choice of four fanfares.", "platform": "Acorn Electron", "release_date": "December 1, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Artic Computing", "publishers": "Artic Computing", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMvHMRptPI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/81939"}
