{"name": "Loopz ", "overview": "It couldn't be simpler. You get pieces of different sizes and shapes. One by one you put them down on the playing board - soon you've made your first loop. Yeaaaah!<br><br>Now it's not so easy. This time you didn't get the pieces you wanted. Never mind - just start another loop.<br><br>All of a sudden the board's getting just a little too crowded. Now you're struggling to find a place to drop the pieces (who cares where they go, you can't afford to let the timer run down because you'll lose a life).<br><br>Now it's getting really hectic. Did you honestly think this game was simple (and this is just the first level of Game A)?<br><br>Pretty soon you'll be dreaming about Loopz. Wondering if next time you'll be able to make a longer loop than ever before - or more loops than your record. Will Loopz drive you crazy?
