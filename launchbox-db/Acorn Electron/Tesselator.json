{"name": "Tesselator", "overview": "Shapes are said to tesselate when they can be used to cover a flat surface without leaving any gaps. The simplest tesselation can be seen in the tiling of a bathroom wall. Square tiles arranged in rows will cover the wall completely but circular tiles, no matter how they are arranged, will always have gaps between them. Squares, then, will tesselate, circules will not. Rectangles, hexagons and some triangles are other well-known tesselating shapes.<br><br>Many artists and designers have used tesselations in their work. Usually this has meant long hours of 'trial and error' as it is not always easy to see if even quite simple shapes will tesselate. Now, with the programs in Tesselator you can avoid all the donkey-word, and experiment freely with complex and natural patterns, gaining a deep insight into this fascinating area of geometric art.<br><br>Tesselator is divided into four sections, each of which concentrates on a particular aspect of the subject.", "platform": "Acorn Electron", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Addison-Wesley", "publishers": "Addison-Wesley", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/81667"}
