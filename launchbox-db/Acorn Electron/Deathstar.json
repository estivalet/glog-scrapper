The space ship always moves forward and it can be rotated left or right in turns of 22.5 degrees, making up sixteen directions in total. There are two additional actions: shooting regular bullets and launching a starbomb. To win a level and move on to a next zone, the player has to defeat a large space craft called DeathStar.<br>When the Deathstar is blown up, a warp drive is activated to move on to the next zone: Worker Zone, the Warrior Zone, the Planetoid Zone and finally the Void Zone. Between each zone there is a bonus screen.<br>The player starts with three lives. There is a radar image near the top of the screen where the various objects and opponents are shown as dots: the player's ship (white), warriors (blue), workers (red), Deathstar (white).", "platform": "Acorn Electron", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Peter Johnson", "publishers": "Blue Ribbon", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/76333"}
