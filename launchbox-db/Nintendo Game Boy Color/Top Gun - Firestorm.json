{"altername_name": [], "name": "Top Gun: Firestorm", "overview": "The popularity of the original film lives on, and thus an update on the time-honored story. The movie that rocketed Tom Cruise's popularity to its height makes for an excellent game, as TOP GUN: Firestorm is packed with the dogfights, strategy, and interpersonal tensions that made its source material so cool. You'll pilot an F-14 Tomcat through many levels of training, fighting, and trick flying. The four different terrain types provide a wide variety of unique challenges for would-be aces, and the collection of enemy fighters is mighty, to say the very least. There are 12 missions in all, and each one will require a different skill set and all of the weapons you can get your hands on. Making the most of its access to full-color graphics, this GBC take on the game boasts incredible animations and detailed terrain from takeoff to landing and everywhere in-between. Whether you're a fan of old action movies or you're just looking for an exciting game, this one's a major score.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "December 4, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Fluid Studios", "publishers": "Titus Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21233-top-gun-firestorm\n"}
