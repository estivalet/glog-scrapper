{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sanrio Timenet: Mirai Hen", "overview": "Sanrio Timenet (Japanese: \u30b5\u30f3\u30ea\u30aa\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8) is a monster-battling game developed by TOSE for the Game Boy Color, which is also compatible with the Game Boy. It was released in two editions, named Sanrio Timenet: Kako Hen (Japanese: \u904e\u53bb\u7de8) and Sanrio Timenet: Mirai Hen (Japanese: \u672a\u6765\u7de8); literally Sanrio Timenet: Past and Present Edition. There are small differences between the versions, including different available monsters and each version being originally set in its respective time periods (past for Kako-Hen or future for Mirai-Hen). Players build up a team of creatures (\"monsters\"), often by catching them using items known as Get Cards (or later in the story, a Digital Camera) and use them to battle against other creatures. The games support the Game Boy Game Link Cable; which can be used to battle with other players and exchange information. Pictures of monsters and Sanrio characters met in the game can be printed using the Game Boy Printer.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "November 27, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "TOSE", "publishers": "Imagineer", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/117527-sanrio-timenet-mirai-hen\n"}
