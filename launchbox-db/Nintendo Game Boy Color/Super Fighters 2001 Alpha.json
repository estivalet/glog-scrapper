{"altername_name": ["Chao Ji Ge Dou 2001 Alpha", "Super Fighter 2001 Alpha"], "name": "Super Fighters 2001 Alpha", "overview": "This one is a straight-up followup to Super Fighters S, with its name translating to Super Fighters 2001 Alpha. As such, it reverts back to being Basically A KOF Game, but presumably the standards of VF's own-label releases didn't allow them to quite commit to an outright copy-job, so all characters are recoloured in the artwork and their names changed to random stuff like \"Oswald\" and \"Jason\". This time we have 24 characters, with a roster loosely based on KOF '99, except with not-Rugal appearing as final boss, and Dina and Cio making a welcome return from Queen Fighters. There is a cool new Yishen Liao soundtrack and a cool intro and a cool title screen and all. Another unique addition for this one is a training mode where you can practice your moves against an inert CPU character. Based on the same Takara fighting game engine. The game features both single player and multiplayer modes, both in single and team format.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "2001", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "", "developers": "Vast Fame", "publishers": "", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/163623-super-fighters-2001-alpha\n"}
