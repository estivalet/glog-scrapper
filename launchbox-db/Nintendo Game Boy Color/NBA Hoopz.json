{"altername_name": [], "name": "NBA Hoopz", "overview": "Are you ready to hoop it up with the pros? Do you have the skills to make it to the next level and take your opponent out like the trash? Are your moves too much to handle? Well, then you might just be ready for the most extreme three-on-three action that videogaming has ever seen. In the bold tradition of arcade classics like NBA JAM, NBA HOOPZ focuses on totally unrealistic, terrifically acrobatic basketball. Fly through the air as you pull off summersault dunks, mind-blowing alley-oops, and graceful outside jumpers. There are no complicated plays or boring rules to hold you back do what you have to do to wrestle the ball away from the other team and put it in the hole. Shaquille O'Neal takes the spotlight in this one, but there are plenty of other NBA stars to play as (though some need to be unlocked by winning games). Choose which players you want to play on your NBA franchise, then jump it up and see who's the best. Other than the regular gameplay, you can try your hand at 2-Ball, Around the World, Twenty-One, and the Three-Pont Shootout.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "February 25, 2001", "game_type": "", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Torus Games", "publishers": "Midway Home Entertainment", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.8", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21288-nba-hoopz\n"}
