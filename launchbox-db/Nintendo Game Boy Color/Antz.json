{"altername_name": [], "name": "Antz", "overview": "Based on the hit movie from DreamWorks, ANTZ for the Game Boy Color is a wild platform adventure that spans 19 levels. Playing as both Z and Princess Bala in this single-player adventure from Infogrames, you'll advance through side-scrolling scenes taken straight from the movie. Beautifully-detailed graphics capture the essence of the jaw-dropping movie visuals in each of the levels, and varied mission goals keep the gameplay fresh throughout. Use pick-axes to dispatch your foes, but look out for common ant disasters like the dreaded magnifying glass. Even a simple shoe can prove to be a major problem when you are ant-sized! Can you defeat the evil General Mandible and save your colony? Save your progress with a handy password feature when you're finished playing for the day. ANTZ is giant-sized fun for everyone!", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "September 28, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "CLCE", "publishers": "Infogrames", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.61", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antz_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/20238-antz\n"}
