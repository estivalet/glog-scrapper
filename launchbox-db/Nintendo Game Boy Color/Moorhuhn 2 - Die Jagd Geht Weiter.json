{"altername_name": [], "name": "Moorhuhn 2: Die Jagd Geht Weiter", "overview": "Moorhuhn 2 is the sequel to the famous shooting game. Similarly to its predecessor, the player goes on a hunt for the eponymous birds. The player can shoot the passing birds with his mouse, reloading the rifle with the right mouse button. Each round lasts 90 seconds, and the goal is to gain as many points as possible. Apart from scoring points by shooting the passing Moorhuhns, the player can also shoot other objects in the environment, such as spiders, rocks or passing planes--some of these give points when shot, others give the player a score penalty.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "April 6, 2001", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Similis", "publishers": "Phenomedia", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/117136-moorhuhn-2-die-jagd-geht-weiter\n"}
