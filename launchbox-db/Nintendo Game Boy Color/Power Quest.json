{"altername_name": ["Gekit\u014d Power Modeler"], "name": "Power Quest", "overview": "The gameplay of Power Quest is a mixture of two genres: RPG and fighting game similar to Hissatsu Doujou Yaburi, Tenkaichi Bushi Keru Naguru and Metal & Lace: Battle of the Robo Babes. You venture around the town in which you live on an overworld map where you can go to different locations. Once you arrive at a location, a character appears on the screen with some dialogue. More often than not this dialog involves the character challenging you to a fight. After you are challenged by a character, the game switches to a one-on-one fighting game engine. This is the RPG's battle system which differs from the usual turn-based battle engine's of the genre. You can buy new parts for your Model which is how you gain experience throughout the game. You progress through the game by challenging a certain amount of people before the next event is triggered. Then special events pop up throughout the game after this number is met which usually involve a tournament or beating some strong boss-type character.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "December 1, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Japan System Supply", "publishers": "Capcom", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.14", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Quest_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA-38H-EJOY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/8317-power-quest\n"}
