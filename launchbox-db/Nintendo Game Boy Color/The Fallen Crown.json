{"altername_name": ["TheFallenCrown"], "name": "The Fallen Crown", "overview": "Cursed and fallen, you will unravel the mysteries of your past as you hunt for the truth behind the ancient monolith known only as 'The Tower'. Play the way you want. Smash your way through obstacles and rush to the finish line, or be cautious and stealthy, taking your time to sneak up on enemies and scour every corner for secrets. At its heart, The Fallen Crown is a Metroidvania. You will create many shortcuts in an interconnected world, while acquiring new skills and gear to reach new areas. You will wield daggers, staves, axes, throwing daggers or the classic sword and board, engaging in visceral combat. However, you will also have to be quick on your 'feet'. You'll find yourself jumping off of ledges, pouncing on enemy heads and shooting projectiles more in line with classic games like Super Mario or Megaman.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "April 5, 2022", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "", "developers": "AtavistGames", "publishers": "itch.io", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/fP19j9QkEgo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/370260-the-fallen-crown\n"}
