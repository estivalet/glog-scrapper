{"altername_name": ["Daikatana", "Daikatana GB", "\u5927\u5200"], "name": "John Romero's Daikatana", "overview": "Daikatana is a Role-Playing game, developed by Ion Storm and published by Kemco. The Game Boy Color version of Daikatana was only released in Europe; Kemco decided against the North American and Japanese release due to the poor reputation of the Daikatana brand. This version's gameplay differs greatly from the N64 and PC versions. At John Romero's request, the title was adapted to the platform as a top-down dungeon crawler, in the style of early Zelda games such as the NES original and The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "June 30, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Will", "publishers": "Kemco", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.06", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daikatana#Game_Boy_Color_version", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/8285-john-romeros-daikatana\n"}
