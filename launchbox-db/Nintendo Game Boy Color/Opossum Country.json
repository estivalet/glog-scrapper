{"altername_name": [], "name": "Opossum Country", "overview": "Opossum Country is a very creepy little Game Boy horror game where a pizza delivery man encounters oddball characters and suspicious behaviour as he makes a delivery to a mysterious trailer park. Created for the SCREAM FM game jam, in Opossum Country you follow the adventure of a pizza delivery man whose curiosity gets the better of him as he discovers a very strange trailer park during one of his deliveries. The trailer park in question is inhabited by an eclectic bunch of oddball residents and seems to be led by an elusive character called Bill. After an unsuccessful attempt at delivering the pizza you\u2019re keen to leave, but there\u2019s a mysterious girl that you\u2019d like to rescue from this nightmarish place first. Taking around 15 minutes to play through, it\u2019s an excellent little horror game with a very unsettling atmosphere and an intriguing story that contains some great twists. The pixel artwork is particularly impressive, with each of the residents rendered in all their grotesque beauty. It does a great job of allowing you to get to know the personalities of each resident and getting to know them as people, which makes the ending that much more poignant. Highly recommended.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "2020", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Ben Jelter", "publishers": "", "genres": "Horror", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7E_a0gKQmc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147459-opossum-country\n"}
