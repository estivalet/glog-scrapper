The game is divided in 5 worlds (The Studios, Ice World, City, Gogo Dodo's world, Looniversity) with varying numbers of sublevels. Getting to the candy is made complicated by conveyor belts, trap doors and fans as well as dissolving bridges etc. To add to the trouble, clones of popular Tiny Toon characters (Plucky Hamton, Furrball etc.) are programmed to attack the player. Extras can be collected for extra energy, time etc. The game is presented from a top down perspective. Estimated playtime approx. 30 hours.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "October 1, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Conspiracy Entertainment", "publishers": "Crave Entertainment", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.86", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/32833-tiny-toon-adventures-dizzys-candy-quest\n"}
