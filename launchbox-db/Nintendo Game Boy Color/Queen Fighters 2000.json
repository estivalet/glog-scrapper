As you might have surmised by now, it was their take on an all-female fighting game, no doubt taking inspiration from SNK Gals Fighters for the Neo Geo Pocket Color. The game itself uses Takara's fighting engine for their The King of Fighters games. The game has difficulty settings, a sound test, single player team and one-on-one matches and multiplayer. There are 16 fighters to choose from, although the ending for each is the same.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "November 1, 2000", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "", "developers": "Vast Fame", "publishers": "Vast Fame", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/163619-queen-fighters-2000\n"}
