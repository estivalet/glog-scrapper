Unlike the DX demo, the full game is here, and it's pretty much a Metroidvania-style Castlevania game on the Game Boy Color, which Konami themselves never attempted. In fact, from the small amount of it I've played, I'd say this is better than any of Konami's official Castlevania games for the Game Boy. The soundtrack is taken from Belmont's Revenge, which was a very good call.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "2003", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "", "developers": "Sintax", "publishers": "", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.bilibili.com/s/video/BV1wL41187NJ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165269-shengui-diguo-zhi-emo-cheng\n"}
