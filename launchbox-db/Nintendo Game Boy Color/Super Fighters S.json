{"altername_name": ["Super Fighters 99", "The King of Fighters 2000", "The King of Fighters 2002"], "name": "Super Fighters S", "overview": "Super Fighters S, re-released as Super Fighters 99 is a unlicensed entry of the The King of Fighters series, mostly based on Takara's The King of Fighters Game Boy ports while taking its character roster from the official The King of Fighters '97. A few things are unusual about this unlicensed The King of Fighters game. First is that it is a unlicensed game that comes with a border when played on a SNES Super Game Boy. This is very uncommon with unlicensed titles. The second thing of note is that unlike the official The King of Fighters Game Boy games, that the characters are actually set up into teams instead of having random characters from all the teams. The only ones not set to teams are Iori and Shingo, who did not have teams in The King of Fighters '97. While many of the characters are taken from the previous official King of Fighters ports done by Takara, several of them are new sprite sets that were designed specifically for this game and do not appear in any official GB ports. The new characters are possibly rescaled in order to fit the regular sprite size. The gameplay engine is based in Takara's original engine used in their official The King of Fighters ports, so the gameplay is very well done to be based on the GB hardware. All gameplay aspects including team/single options and the actual fighting engine is the same as those found in Takara's originals, with the exception of link play, which was removed.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "", "developers": "Vast Fame", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133083-super-fighters-s\n"}
