{"altername_name": [], "name": "Road Rash", "overview": "Jump on a motorcycle and beat up the competition in ROAD RASH. You must race 15 other competitors to the finish line, but there's a catch: your opponents are equipped with weapons including chains, clubs, and pipes, and they have no problems using them on you when you get too close. Luckily, you can kick to get rid of these guys, or you just might be able to catch one and steal his weapon. Keep in mind, though, that the cops are patrolling and will not hesitate to pull you over. By placing in the top three of any race, you will be awarded some cash to spend on new bike parts or a whole new motorcycle. If your friends want to join the brutal action, they can with the Link Cable mode. Are you tough enough to take out the competition in ROAD RASH?", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "November 29, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "3d6 Games", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.38", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_Rash_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-msIMN1A4DI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21281-road-rash\n"}
