{"altername_name": ["Yars' Revenge: The Quotile Ultimatum"], "name": "Yars' Revenge", "overview": "The classic Atari 2600 game YAR'S REVENGE has made its way to the Game Boy Color. You take control a giant space fly known as a Yar, and you must destroy the Qotile base on the other side of the screen. But you must first get through the large shield that guards the base. Fortunately, you have an unlimited supply of missiles to destroy the shield, or you can fly into the shield and eat a brick. Once there is an opening in the shield, touch the Qotile base with the Yar to activate the Zorlon Cannon. Once activated, you can fire the cannon to destroy the base. As you progress through the 250 levels, the game moves faster and becomes more challenging. Help Yar destroy the Qotile in YAR'S REVENGE.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "September 1, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Vatical Entertainment", "publishers": "Telegames", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.3", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yars%27_Revenge#Remakes_and_rereleases", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dq2lHxFdLr8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/8338-yars-revenge\n"}
