{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ken Griffey Jr.'s Slugfest", "overview": "All of the action of professional baseball has been shrunk and put on the Game Boy Color with KEN GRIFFEY JR.'S SLUGFEST. You can play as any Major League team, complete with real players. Once you have the right team, play an Exhibition game to work on putting all aspects of the game together. If you want some extended competition, play a 26, 78, or 162 game Season, during which all of the performance stats for each player are tracked. If you don't want to deal with the ups and downs of a Season, skip right to the World Series and try to win it all. And if you don't have time for a full game, see how many dingers you can hit in the Home Run Derby. Will you be able to handle the pressures of professional baseball? The only way to find out is to play KEN GRIFFEY JR.'S SLUGFEST.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "June 1, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Software Creations", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.33", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Griffey_Jr.%27s_Slugfest", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Vlgcg4W0Ps", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21373-ken-griffey-jrs-slugfest\n"}
