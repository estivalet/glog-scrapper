{"altername_name": [], "name": "Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine", "overview": "The Communists are trying to reassemble a machine that will open the door to a parallel universe. However, many of the key parts are missing. It is up to you as Indiana Jones to search the globe and recover the pieces before the Soviets do. You will have to run, jump, swim, and fight his way through 19 levels of action. Luckily, you can use a whip, pistol, machine gun, and grenades on the Soviet soldiers, spiders, scorpions, snakes, wolves, jaguars, sharks, jellyfish, and poisonous lice you encounter. After completing a level, you will be treated to a cinematic clip that will advance the plot and reveal the password you need to continue the game. The world will only be safe when the missing parts are recovered and the Communist threat is quelled in INDIANA JONES AND THE INFERNAL MACHINE.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "March 22, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "HotGen Studios", "publishers": "THQ", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.54", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21367-indiana-jones-and-the-infernal-machine\n"}
