{"altername_name": [], "name": "SWiV", "overview": "SWIV is a vertically scrolling shoot-em-up which plays in a typical fashion to other games in its genre. The player chooses between using either a helicopter or a jeep at the beginning of the game and then plays in their chosen vehicles through scrolling levels, shooting at oncoming enemies. Certain enemies when shot drop shield power-ups which can be either picked up to afford temporarily invincibility or detonated to destroy all enemies onscreen. Every so often a boss enemy will attack. The destruction of these bosses will give upgrades to the player's forward firing gun.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "March 16, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "TCC", "publishers": "SCi Games", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWIV", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5b8UVoO4rA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/32831-swiv\n"}
