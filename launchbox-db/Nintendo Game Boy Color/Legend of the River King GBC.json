Travel throughout the world and blaze trails to find the best fishing holes. Be careful though, because you might have to fight wild animals with your bare hands. You can catch fish with either bait or lures, each with relative strengths and weaknesses. After catching a small one, keep it stress-free in an aquarium and watch it grow. Hopefully, you will be able to find the Guardian Fish and save your sister in LEGEND OF THE RIVER KING.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "November 23, 1999", "game_type": "", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Natsume", "publishers": "Natsume", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/14729-legend-of-the-river-king-gbc\n"}
