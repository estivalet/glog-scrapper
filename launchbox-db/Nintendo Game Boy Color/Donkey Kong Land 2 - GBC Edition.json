{"altername_name": ["Donkey Kong Land 2: Game Boy Color Edition"], "name": "Donkey Kong Land 2: GBC Edition", "overview": "This patch will convert Donkey Kong Land 2 from a monochrome Game Boy game to a Game Boy Color game. With this, the entire Donkey Kong Land series is now in color! In addition, two new options can be accessed by pressing Select on the overworld: Follower Kong and New Kiddy Mode. Follower Kong attempts to recreate the system from the SNES games where the Kong you are not currently playing as will follow behind you, while New Kiddy Mode is an easy mode where Kiddy Kong functions as an extra hit. In addition to these, a custom rain effect based on the one used in Donkey Kong Land III will be used on the levels Topsail Trouble and Kreepy Krow. A sound test can be accessed by pressing Select at Klubba\u2019s Kiosk that will play songs from Donkey Kong Land 2, Donkey Kong Land III, and Conker\u2019s Pocket Tales. For full information on known bugs and more detailed information on the added features, please check the included readme.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/6866/", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/169186-donkey-kong-land-2-gbc-edition\n"}
