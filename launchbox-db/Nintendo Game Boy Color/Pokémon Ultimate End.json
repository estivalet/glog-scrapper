{"altername_name": ["Pokemon Ultimate End"], "name": "Pok\u00e9mon Ultimate End", "overview": "Pok\u00e9mon Ultimate End is a good Pokemon Crystal Hack. It is not for those who like nice graphics because it uses Pok\u00e9mon Crystal Codebase with GBC graphics. But it is really for those who want a quality game to play with harder mode and new features. This hack is a lot more difficult than Pok\u00e9mon Gold/Silver/Crystal you have played and after you meet Lance GYM Leader, your rivals own Level 100 Pok\u00e9mon and so hard to beat them. Good Luck!!! Not like the original version, you live Ice Cave which is next to New Bark Town (instead of New Bark Town). You start to do your dream to beat the strong Pok\u00e9mon Trainers, GYM Leaders and Elite Four. Along your way, you have chances to meet a lot of strong trainers with high level Pok\u00e9mon. So you must prepare your team carefully with suitable Pok\u00e9mon to enter battles.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "2010", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Miksy91", "publishers": "", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78736-pokemon-ultimate-end\n"}
