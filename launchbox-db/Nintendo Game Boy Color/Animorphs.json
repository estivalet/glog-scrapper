{"altername_name": [], "name": "Animorphs", "overview": "ANIMORPHS is a single-player RPG based on the popular children's book series and television show. You assume the role of the Animorphs, a group of kids with the ability to transform into any animal they touch. As an Animorph, you must use these unique abilities to stop an invasion of your planet by a group of aliens known as Yeerks. You'll change into a large variety of animals including an elephant, a fish, a bird, a mouse, and many more as you fight for the survival of your planet. Explore four large areas in search of microprocessor chips that control the Yeerk ship. Make sure no one sees you using your special powers, though, or you'll be the government's newest guinea pig! Keep an eye out for the Yeerks as well, as they are more than willing to put an end to your quest. Fortunately, you can battle back with the power of the beasts. Save your progress with the password save function to continue the search another day.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "November 7, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Run and Gun!", "publishers": "Ubi Soft Entertainment Software", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.92", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/16922-animorphs\n"}
