{"altername_name": ["Chiki Chiki Machine Mou Race", "Autos Locos, Los", "Los Autos Locos"], "name": "Wacky Races", "overview": "Dick Dastardly, Muttley, Peter Perfect, Penelope Pitstop, and the whole gang from WACKY RACES have come to the Game Boy Color. Choose from eight vehicles based on the cars from the television series. Once you have the perfect vehicle, try to finish in third place or better to continue to the next race in the Arcade mode. In Endurance, the player in last place at the end of each lap is eliminated, while the Championship mode has you race through all nine tracks, earning points based on what place you finish in. If you don't like crowded tracks, go as fast as you can on an empty track in the Time Trial mode. No matter what mode you play, you will have to deal with challenging tracks filled with jumps, bonuses and traps. Try to finish in first place with WACKY RACES.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "June 9, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Velez & Dubail", "publishers": "Infogrames", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.87", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wacky_Races_(2000_video_game)", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNedYpA7BRg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21480-wacky-races\n"}
