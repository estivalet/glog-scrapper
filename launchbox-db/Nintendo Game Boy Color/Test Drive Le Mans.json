{"altername_name": ["Le Mans 24 Hours"], "name": "Test Drive Le Mans", "overview": "Take a little trip around the world for grueling, 24-hour race action. Based on the annual racing series that takes place in the south of France, this version will lead you from Toronto to Detroit, to the peaks of Everest. Take your pick from 10 real racing vehicles, like the Nissan R390 and the BMW V12VMR. With more than 10 courses to race on, you'll certainly have your work cut out for you. Along the tour, you'll use oil slicks, engine upgrades, invincibility power-ups, and more to get an edge on the competition. The better you do, the more cars you'll be able to unlock, and thereby improving your chances of taking the cup. There are three different play modes: Le Mans pits you against tough competition in a real Le Mans circuit; Championship takes you through a full season; and Arcade allows you play a single race. The graphics are great, the gameplay is smooth, and there are more options than you could ever ask for. Buckle up and put the pedal to the metal!", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "June 1, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Velez & Dubail", "publishers": "Infogrames", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21285-test-drive-le-mans\n"}
