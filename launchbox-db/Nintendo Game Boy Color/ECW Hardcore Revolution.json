{"altername_name": [], "name": "ECW Hardcore Revolution", "overview": "When the wrestling-license musical chairs ended last year, Acclaim must have felt like it was on the hurtin' end of a Stone Cold suplex, what with EA snagging the WCW license from THQ and an enraged THQ, its spirit meter jacked up to stratospheric levels, responding by wresting the prized WWF license from Acclaim's grasp. All's fair in love and corporate lumberjack matches, though, so Acclaim pulled itself off the canvas and went out in search of a new franchise. The answer lay as close as the nearest TV, where Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) holds court weekly on The Nashville Network. Sealing the deal for a long time to come, Acclaim has invested some of its many WWF and Turok bucks in the ECW.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "February 1, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Crawfish Interactive", "publishers": "Acclaim Entertainment", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.91", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nHKgoGMj_c", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21341-ecw-hardcore-revolution\n"}
