The hack uses the Pokered Disassembly from the users at Skeetendo as a base. It is intended both as a Rombase for people who want an updated Red Version as a starting point (although admittedly, some of the features wouldn't appeal to all Gen 1 hackers it seems), and as a stand-alone game for people that want to relive the nostalgia of Gen 1 without some of the broken mechanics and with added features.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "2015", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mateo", "publishers": "", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78628-pokemon-red\n"}
