{"altername_name": [], "name": "Perfect Choro Q", "overview": "While Perfect Choro Q is a racing game, it does not control the same way as most racing games. Perfect Choro Q is turn based racing and controls much like a golf game. The player takes turns with the computer opponents, which starts out with the player choosing which direction the car will go in (which is represented by a dotted line.) Once the desired direction is chosen then the power will be chosen by pressing the A button to stop the moving power meter. Perfect Choro Q also has some role-playing elements in that the player drives a car along an overworld map and has multiple destinations that can be chosen.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "August 11, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Electronics Application", "publishers": "Takara", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/129201-perfect-choro-q\n"}
