{"altername_name": ["Razmoket, Les: Voyage dans le Temps"], "name": "Rugrats: Time Travelers", "overview": "The Rugrats are about to find out that the only thing more exciting than traveling through your own backyard is traveling through time. After discovering a time machine, the kids accidentally scatter themselves throughout history, and you're the only one who can reunite the famous babies with their beloved cohorts. Each of the game's 12 levels puts you in charge of a different character, charging you with tasks like finding a lost toy, locating fellow Rugrats, or tracking down mysterious items. The whole debacle begins when Chuckie won't enter the time machine with the other babies, but he changes his mind as soon as the rest if the gang disappears and leaves him all alone. Chuckie's attempt to track down the others puts him in the 1800s, but none of his friends are there. In fact, Tommy is in ancient Egypt, Angelica is at an old circus, Phil is trapped in prehistory, and Dil is, somehow, lost in space! Can you collect all of the lost items and round up the babies before it's too late?", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "November 1, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Software Creations", "publishers": "THQ", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.06", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21430-rugrats-time-travelers\n"}
