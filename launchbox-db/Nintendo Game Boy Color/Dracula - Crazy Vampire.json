{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dracula: Crazy Vampire", "overview": "Dracula: Crazy Vampire is a 2D top-down game, starring count Dracula. The game uses cartoony \"big-heads\" stylized graphics. Dracula slept a long time. Now, he has a new enemy - Grand Inquisitor Torquemada - and must find 11 of his fellow vampires. The Count explores the castle, and fights against various opponents by shooting bats. Drinking the enemies' blood replenishes health. Dracula must also solve some puzzles by moving crates, flipping switches, opening doors, or lowering drawbridges. He can talk to other characters. The game has eleven levels, some of which take place outside the castle. In those levels, Dracula must avoid the deadly sunbeams.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "October 9, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Planet Interactive Development", "publishers": "DreamCatcher Interactive", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.22", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21313-dracula-crazy-vampire\n"}
