{"altername_name": [], "name": "Flipper & Lopaka", "overview": "Flipper & Lopaka is a licensed side-scroller based on the Australian cartoon of the same name. The premise of the show is that Flipper the dolphin has taught Lopaka (a native Pacific islander boy) the secrets of the ocean, allowing him to survive underwater for long periods and communicate with sea life. Together the two must usually stop the evil plans of Dexter, a mean octopus. The game has you trade off between the two characters: Lopaka must find a magic crystal in his sprawling platforming levels, then Flipper must take the crystal and place it on an altar in his Ecco the Dolphin-style levels. Flipper also handles the boss fights, and the bonus levels that are accessed by collecting 100 pearls.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "March 16, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Planet Interactive Development", "publishers": "Ubi Soft Entertainment Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/32803-flipper-lopaka\n"}
