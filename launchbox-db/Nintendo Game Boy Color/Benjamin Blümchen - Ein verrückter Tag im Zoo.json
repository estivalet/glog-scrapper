{"altername_name": ["Benjamin Bluemchen: Ein verrueckter Tag im Zoo"], "name": "Benjamin Bl\u00fcmchen: Ein verr\u00fcckter Tag im Zoo", "overview": "Benjamin Bl\u00fcmchen: Ein verr\u00fcckter Tag im Zoo (\"A Crazy Day at the Zoo\") is based on the long-running German children's audio play series starring talking elephant Benjamin Bl\u00fcmchen and his friends. In the game, Benjamin and his friend Otto are hired by newspaper reporter Karla Kolumna to take some photographs of the zoo animals for an article she's writing. This of course leads to all kinds of trouble for the two: they must navigate ice floats to get to the polar bear, take part in an animal race and must get back the camera when it's stolen (twice). Images in comic style illustrate the story between levels. The game consists of six action-filled levels, with most of them featuring a unique gameplay mechanic. Level progress is saved via passwords. It is always possible to play completed levels again, trying to get a better score by using less tries or by finishing in a better place in the race.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "November 6, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "BVM Produktion", "publishers": "Kiddinx Entertainment", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.86", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/117384-benjamin-blumchen-ein-verruckter-tag-im-zoo\n"}
