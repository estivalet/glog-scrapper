{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pokemon Wasteland", "overview": "Embark for a short, yet challenging Pok\u00e9mon adventure! Discover Dakos, a small region set in a hostile wasteland, with a unique story. Goals Dakos is a small region with only 3 towns, all accessible from the beginning. I\u2019ve created an exciting hack offering players a short, immersive adventure. With this game, you can start and finish in a single run but expect a challenging and captivating experience. The storyline is coherent, and much effort has gone into the dialogue to keep players engaged. It\u2019s highly recommended that players engage with non-playable characters (NPCs) to understand their surroundings and progress through the adventure. However, players who prefer to grind can also do so. The wasteland theme of the game is evident in the storyline and tileset, with trainers and the wilderness being particularly hostile, especially at night. Furthermore, items are scarce in Dakos so players won\u2019t find any potions in this ROM.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "2023", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "z3bra", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/373296-pokemon-wasteland\n"}
