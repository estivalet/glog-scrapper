{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pokemon Peridot Version", "overview": "A brand-new region for the player to explore. Previously unused Pokemon from various points in Gold & Silver's development. These feature fanmade names, stats, and typing. The player will have two rivals. Both will challenge the player to a battle periodically(Only one per character in this demo). Shiny Pokemon will have a Defense and Special DV of 15, the Attack DV calculation remains the same as regular Generation 2 games. Speed is not taken into account at all. This results in a 1/512 shiny chance. Borrowing from Pokemon Sun & Moon, certain routes will have a trainer that will refuse a challenge until every other trainer on that route is defeated. Move Tutors are scattered around the maps, sometimes in hidden areas. They will mostly teach moves that were exclusive to events in Gold & Silver. Every starter will be available through in-game trades. Prompt to use another repel when one runs out.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "2020", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "", "developers": "Sea_Tree", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/373255-pokemon-peridot-version\n"}
