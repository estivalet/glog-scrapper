{"altername_name": [], "name": "Micro Machines 1 and 2: Twin Turbo", "overview": "Tiny cars race through the house in MICRO MACHINES 1 AND 2: Twin Turbo. Take 15 vehicles including jeeps, helicopters, tanks, speedboats, and sports cars onto 60 different tracks like the breakfast table, the garden, and the pool table. Each track has its own obstacles and hazards, so keep your eyes peeled. For example, watch out for the rubber ducks, soapsuds, and whirlpool drain in the bathtub. The biggest hazard is falling off of the track, which costs time and puts you way behind. As an added bonus, there is a Two-Player mode that can be played on one Game Boy: one player uses direction pad and the other uses the buttons to steer his vehicle left or right, the goal being to push the opposition off of the track. With all of the track and vehicle choices, there is plenty to keep you playing MICRO MACHINES 1 AND 2: Twin Turbo.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "January 1, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Virtucraft", "publishers": "THQ", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.58", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21320-micro-machines-1-and-2-twin-turbo\n"}
