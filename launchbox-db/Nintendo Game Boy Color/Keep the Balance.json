{"altername_name": [], "name": "Keep the Balance", "overview": "Keep the balance! is a puzzle game, where you have to balance a big weighing scale. The longer it stays in balance the more point you gain. To do this, you have a catapult at your disposal, the objects you need to use to balance the scale are given to you by conveyor belt. One on the left and one on the right. But these objects differ in weight, so you must carefully choose the scales bucket you're going to put the objects in. To make things worse, all kinds of trouble appear on screen to make it just a little bit more challenging. Like crocodiles that eat object or jokers that throw around playing cards offsetting your carefully balance scale. The game stages 5 different game worlds each divided into 16 levels.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "November 2, 2001", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Karma Studios", "publishers": "JoWooD Productions Software", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/31227-keep-the-balance\n"}
