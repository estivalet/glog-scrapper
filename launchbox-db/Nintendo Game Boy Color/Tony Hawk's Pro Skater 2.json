{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2", "overview": "The gameplay in this Game Boy Color adaptation of the long-running skateboarding franchise is much more akin to a balls-out side-scrolling action game than the cautious Kathy obstacle course runs of the first Tony Hawk. Developed by Japanese studio Natsume, gameplay allows several types of grinds that can link combos on the game's infinite rails, and aerial tricks are nearly as detailed as their 32-bit home boys. GBC owners can choose from 12 professional skaters and skate through seven different locations. No battery save, but the password save system supports the Game Boy Printer for easier logging.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "November 1, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Natsume", "publishers": "Activision", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.96", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hawk%27s_Pro_Skater_2", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxE13yPe_cw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21466-tony-hawks-pro-skater-2\n"}
