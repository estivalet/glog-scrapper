{"altername_name": ["Pocket Monsters Go! Go!", "Pokemon Go! Go! Go!"], "name": "Pocket Monsters Go! Go!", "overview": "Monster Go! Go! Go!! is a hack of The Smurfs 3 released in the late 1990s for the Game Boy Color. The Smurfs 3 was originally in monochrome, but was colorized in this hack - it was later re-released officially in color as The Smurfs Nightmare, and a subsequent version of the hack was based on this release. Almost all the graphics from the original game are replaced, and so does the intro and ending text. Bizarrely, the intro text appears to be replaced with a poorly translated version of My Heart Will Go On by C\u00e9line Dion. Aside from the title screen, the game's use of color is limited, which gives it the appearance of a Super Game Boy game. The game suffers from extreme slowdown, running consistently at about half speed, possibly due to the colorization process.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133081-pocket-monsters-go-go\n"}
