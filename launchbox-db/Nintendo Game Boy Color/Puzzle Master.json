{"altername_name": [], "name": "Puzzle Master", "overview": "The Goblin King has corrupted the elements and is flooding the world, and it's up to you to save it. Groups of four elements fire, water, stone, and wood fall from the sky. You must position the elements in such a way that three of the same type touch each other, and are thus eliminated. However, there are some complicating factors: monsters will appear on the play field and will throw pollution blocks that cannot be removed. Further, each round has some tasks which range from watering a flowerpot to triggering a drawbridge that will eliminate several rows which need to be completed.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "December 1, 1999", "game_type": "", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Metro3D", "publishers": "Metro3D", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21417-puzzle-master\n"}
