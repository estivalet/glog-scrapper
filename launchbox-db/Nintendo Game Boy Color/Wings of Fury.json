{"altername_name": [], "name": "Wings of Fury", "overview": "World War II is in its final days. Your mission is to escort the carrier USS Wasp to port for repairs. Along the way, you will fly 15 sorties in an F6F Hellcat fighter plane to destroy enemy craft that might pose a threat to the Wasp. Luckily, you are armed with a wide variety of weapons, some of the most useful being bombs, rockets, and torpedoes. However, use these weapons wisely, as they affect only certain types of enemies. To keep from being shot down, there are several maneuvers you can use like barrel rolls, dive bombs, and the split S. After eliminating all of the targets in a particular mission, you must return to the Wasp and land if you crash, the mission is a failure. Will you be able to get the Wasp (and yourself) home safely? Play WINGS OF FURY to find out.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "December 1, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Ed Magnin and Associates", "publishers": "Mindscape", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/17233-wings-of-fury\n"}
