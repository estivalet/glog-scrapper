Power up by digging yourself and going ahead and finding items. By picking up and using the \"stones\" that have fallen in the dungeon, the parameters will increase. There are many types of stones, such as \"fire\" and \"water\", which are attribute parameters, in addition to stones that increase the basic parameters \"attack power\" and \"defense power\", so you can use the stones to grow your own poyon.
