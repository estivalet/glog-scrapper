{"altername_name": [], "name": "Zoids: Shirogane no Juukishin Liger Zero", "overview": "Designed specifically for the Game Boy Color, this game features the adventures of Allstar and his silver Liger Zero. During a battle, he and his rival Solid (who pilots a Super Geno Saurer, a variant with four long-range cannons) fall into an underground world. Allstar teams up with a girl he meets there, Party, to combat the unpiloted Berserk F\u00fchrer that has been attacking villages, as his Liger Zero is foretold to be the underground world's savior and thus the only one that can stop it. They search through old ruins to find the Liger Zero's three armours, which are needed to complete the game, and restore peace to the underground world by stopping the confused AI computer driving the Zoids mad and defeating the Berserk F\u00fchrer. Party appears to grow quite fond of Allstar and the Liger along the way, happily declaring as much when she follows him back home at the end of the game.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "June 15, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "TOMY", "publishers": "Tomy", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/117194-zoids-shirogane-no-juukishin-liger-zero\n"}
