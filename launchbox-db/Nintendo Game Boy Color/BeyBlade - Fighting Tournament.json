{"altername_name": ["Beyblade: Tournament Fighting"], "name": "BeyBlade: Fighting Tournament", "overview": "Beyblade Fighting Tournament was the second video game released. This game features some concepts and ideas that were later abandoned within the Beyblade franchise, though many ideas were continued on within the manga and anime. The standard game play involves visiting locations and the player fights their way through tornements to advance to the next stage of the game. As each tornement was won, more parts and bit-beasts are made able to be bought from the games shop. The player could only start with one of 4 arch-types, \"Dragoon\", \"Draciel\", \"Dranzer\" and \"Driger\". Intially by default the player could only choose Dragoons, although codes were released in magazines to acess the other arch-types. Within each match, however, aside from the launch the player had virtually no control on the beyblade once it was in the arena, resulting in many matchses being won more based on luck and the beyblades strength then player skill.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "August 11, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Rokumendo", "publishers": "Hudson Soft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tba3g8a25b8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/74100-beyblade-fighting-tournament\n"}
