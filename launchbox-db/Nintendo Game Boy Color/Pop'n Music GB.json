Notes scroll toward the bottom of the screen, and the player must tap the correct buttons in time with the music to play along. Play well, and the \"groove meter\" increases, but play poorly and it will drop. If the groove meter is high enough at the end of the song, the player can move on to the next song. The 9 buttons of the original game have been reduced to 5 for the Game Boy's control setup, and there are 25 tracks included; 15 arranged tracks from the first three arcade and console releases, along with 10 new original tracks. The game includes a single-player Original mode, as well as a 2-player Versus mode.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "March 30, 2000", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Bemani", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop%27n_Music_Mickey_Tunes", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/79668-popn-music-gb\n"}
