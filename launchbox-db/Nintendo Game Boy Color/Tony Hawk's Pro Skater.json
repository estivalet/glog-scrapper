Try to score as many tricks as possible in the Halfpipe mode, where the biggest rewards come with complexity and originality. In the Tournament mode, you must compete against professional skaters in five different skate parks, navigating through the park and performing tricks. Hopefully, you will be able to beat the competition to the finish line. If your friends want in on the action, you can challenge them to a race with the Versus mode, where you can compete via the link cable. But don't enter the Versus mode unless you are prepared; the best preparation comes by playing the One-on-One mode against the computer. Get all of the skateboarding action you can handle with TONY HAWK'S PRO SKATER.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "March 30, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Natsume", "publishers": "Activision", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.10", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hawk%27s_Pro_Skater", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/17138-tony-hawks-pro-skater\n"}
