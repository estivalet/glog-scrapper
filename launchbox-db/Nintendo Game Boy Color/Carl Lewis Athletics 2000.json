{"altername_name": [], "name": "Carl Lewis Athletics 2000", "overview": "Carl Lewis Athletics 2000 is a sports game focusing on Decathlon and its ten disciplines: pole vault, long jump, shot put, discus throw, javelin throw, high jump and running (100, 110, 400 and 150 metres). The controls follow the traditional mechanics: rhythmic button mashing, if necessarily followed by pressing an action button. Besides the traditional championship mode, the player can also participate in the arcade mode in which a certain performance must be met in order to qualify to the next event. Unlockable by winning the Decathlon is a special mode with three additional disciplines: hurdles (200 and 400 metres) and 100 metres relay race. The player creates an athlete who is saved on the cartridge and can be improved by training. Up to two players can participate simultaneously; some disciplines also offer a hot-seat option with only one cartridge. Best times and a ghost can be transferred via infrared. A side effect of this feature is the possibility to race against the own ghost.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "September 15, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Planet Interactive Development", "publishers": "Ubi Soft Entertainment Software", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/24766-carl-lewis-athletics-2000\n"}
