It's a sequel to 1999's Wizardry Empire using mostly the same gameplay-system. Notable changes include: It's again possible for the Thief, Ninja and Kunoichi to fail at trap-identification and disarming. When encountering a treasure chest a timer will start, gradually lowering the quality of the loot in the chest until it's successfully opened. Changing a Thief into a Ninja with the Thieves' Dagger retain all level and stats of the Thief instead of functioning like traditional class change. The equipment needed to change to the Special Classes are acquired from specific events rather than being random drops.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "December 22, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Starfish", "publishers": "Starfish", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113762-wizardry-empire-staff-of-resurrection\n"}
