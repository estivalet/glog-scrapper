In it, Pierce Brosnan's Bond must investigate the murder of a British oil tycoon and attacks on his new pipeline, which leads to a larger sinister plot requiring gunplay and frequent flier miles to diffuse. In contrast to the Nintendo 64 and Playstation versions, this game only has eight missions and features a 2D overhead view instead of a 3D first-person. There is no multiplayer, no difficulty levels, and no save feature. Passwords are used to skip to later levels and unlock certain cheats.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "September 1, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "2n Productions", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.26", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_Is_Not_Enough_(2001_video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lvz0HjSFTAQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/20106-007-the-world-is-not-enough\n"}
