Featuring two classic arcade action titles, ARCADE HITS is packed full of fun. In SPY HUNTER, you play a super spy trying to thwart the nefarious plots of your adversaries. Take to the road in your souped-up roadster in a thrilling overhead chase. Collect power-ups to increase your firepower, oil slicks to give the baddies the slip, and more. Take out as many of the enemies as you can, but watch out for civilians or you'll have some explaining to do! MOON PATROL takes you to the surface of the Moon, driving a fully armed dune buggy in side-scrolling mayhem. Blast away at the Moon critters that are out to get you, and keep an eye out for craters! Both games are perfect graphical reproductions of the vintage arcade machines.
