{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX", "overview": "The Game Boy Color gets its own BMX trick game with DAVE MIRRA FREESTYLE BMX. You'll play through eight different stages that will give you the chance to pull off some wild stunts and spectacular jumps. Each course will challenge you to complete a variety of objectives, ranging from specific stunts to collecting items. Perform each of the objectives to earn points, unlock new stages, and upgrade your bike for better tricks. The game is played from a ?-overhead perspective, which allows you a maximum view of the surrounding area. Each of the levels has a multitude of obstacles and items to perform tricks on and, with careful timing, you'll be able to create wild trick combinations off multiple objects. You can play a Tournament mode with up to three friends by passing the system after each run, and you can save your progress and high scores using the password save function.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "November 10, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "NEON Software", "publishers": "Acclaim Entertainment", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.64", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Mirra_Freestyle_BMX", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ-LTKrVi8k", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21306-dave-mirra-freestyle-bmx\n"}
