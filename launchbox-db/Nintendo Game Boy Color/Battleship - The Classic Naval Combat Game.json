{"altername_name": ["Battleship"], "name": "Battleship: The Classic Naval Combat Game", "overview": "Now it's your turn to sink your opponent's battleship in this Game Boy Color rendition of the classic strategic board game. Players deploy all four of their ships to different areas on a grid, and take turns firing shots at various parts of their opponent's grid. Hit each ship the required number of times, and the ship is removed from play. In a unique twist on the classic game, each ship has new weapons. For the solo player, there are 48 missions to complete with animated full-color cutscenes to inspire you to victory! The real challenge however, is taking on a human opponent via a link cable. Forget setting up the board and looking for missing pieces, this is the real way to play Battleship!", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "January 1, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Use", "publishers": "Majesco Sales", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.19", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21226-battleship-the-classic-naval-combat-game\n"}
