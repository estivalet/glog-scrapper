{"altername_name": [], "name": "Kakurenbo Battle Monster Tactics", "overview": "Players take control of a young trainee monster hunter named Kevin who has been cast to the Iraldi Kingdom to defeat all of the monsters that are running amok there. Later, he got two partners joining in with his journey: Kaen and Tarren. Due to the world of Iraldi being shrouded in darkness, players must use a flashlight to guide themselves into it. Monsters are hidden in the darkness and must be found before battles begin; however, players have a skill level that lets them determine whether it is a good idea to fight a monster or not. The MonTac Skill scanner can allow players to find out a monster's skill, and then prepare themselves to battle it with skill rings.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "November 21, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Spiral", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/117438-kakurenbo-battle-monster-tactics\n"}
