{"altername_name": [], "name": "Resident Evil", "overview": "Following the success of the original PlayStation edition of Resident Evil in 1996, Capcom expanded the game in a number of ports - one of those planned was for the GameBoy Color. In 1999, HotGen Studios, Ltd., a company in the United Kingdom, was selected by Capcom to port the game. HotGen designed the game to be a direct-conversion of the PlayStation version following the same single-player paths as other versions with options to play as either Chris Redfield or Jill Valentine. New additions were also planned including a greater variety in enemies and the ability to disarm traps. A new save feature was also in development, removing the need for Ink Ribbons and finding save points. However, after sending the finished product to Capcom for evaluation, the company turned it away. Their official statement in 2000 claimed that they were \"not confident that the product would have made both consumers and Capcom happy.\"", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "HotGen Studios", "publishers": "", "genres": "Horror", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.63", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz85kB1ZWk4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/26920-resident-evil\n"}
