More than just an updated sequel, this racing game is packed with mechanic's gadgets and gizmos. For instance, now you can modify your car before a race--tweak the suspension, transmission, steering, or even change the engines. Pick the parts you'll need to leave everyone else in your rear-view mirror. Winning provides you with enough spending money to customize your ride at the garage or paint shop. With both single-player and versus modes, you can test your modified cars against your Game Boy Color or your best friend.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "January 1, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Kemco", "publishers": "Vatical Entertainment", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.68", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/8332-top-gear-pocket-2\n"}
