The farm, situated on an island, needs plenty of work, so you need all your skills to get things working correctly. Your many tasks range from tending to the farm animals, keeping an eye on the budget while purchasing goods at the local stores, and so forth. And although the main aim is to build and maintain the farm, there are plenty of opportunities to take care of yourself (go to the movies, buy pets, find a girlfriend/boyfriend).", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "November 14, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Natsume", "publishers": "Natsume", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.74", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest_Moon_3_GBC", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/18231-harvest-moon-3-gbc\n"}
