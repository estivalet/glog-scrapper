Players control K\u00e4pt'n Blaub\u00e4r in levels made up of tiles. The goal is for players to help K\u00e4pt'n Blaub\u00e4r walk over a set amount of star tiles per level and then make it to a life preserver tile to finish the level. The tricky part comes as when K\u00e4pt'n Blaub\u00e4r walks over a star tile it instantly converts to a pool of water which will cost K\u00e4pt'n Blaub\u00e4r his life if he enters it. So players have to contemplate on how to move K\u00e4pt'n Blaub\u00e4r or else they can unwittingly cut of his path and trap him in an unwinnable situation. The game worlds also have some other types of tiles to contend with like conveyor belts and wood tiles that crack and will cost K\u00e4pt'n Blaub\u00e4r his life if he stands on them for too long. The game consists of 6 worlds made up of 15 levels each for a total of 90 puzzles to solve. In between worlds there is a small mini-game in which K\u00e4pt'n Blaub\u00e4r pilots a submarine and has to avoid crashing into ocean life and also has to collect air bubbles so the subs oxygen doesn't deplete.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "January 10, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Shin'en Multimedia", "publishers": "Ravensburger Interactive Media", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVRyaVv__VE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/117388-kaptn-blaubar-die-verruckte-schatzsuche\n"}
