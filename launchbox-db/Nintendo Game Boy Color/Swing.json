{"altername_name": [], "name": "Swing", "overview": "Swing was a Germany exclusive Game Boy Color puzzle game. A multilanguage prototype with an English option also exists. The object of the game is to score points by dropping balls onto sets of see-saws, in rows of three or more of the same colour. The twist, however, is that each ball has a different weight, determined by the number written on the front of it. The higher the number, the heavier the ball. This means that if a ball is placed onto one side of the see-saw which is heavier than the total value of the balls on the other side, the balance would be upset, sending the top ball flying across the playing field to land on another column. Cascade 'throws' can be achieved, and the game is over if a column reaches too tall. A variety of bonus balls, all with special uses, also feature.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "October 20, 2000", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Software 2000", "publishers": "Software 2000", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/29652-swing\n"}
