It is the first sequel in the Tales series, which normally does not have connected storylines. The story begins 205 years after the beginning of Tales of Phantasia. Due to the limits of the Game Boy, the game uses a battle system called Petit LMBS, a turn-based variation on the Linear Motion Battle System used by the rest of the series. As in normal LMBS, the player controls only one character and does so via button combinations instead of a dialogue choice, while party members are computer-controlled. A remake of the game was later released on PlayStation Portable called Tales of Phantasia: Narikiri Dungeon X.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "November 10, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Wolf Team", "publishers": "Namco", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.83", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_of_Phantasia:_Narikiri_Dungeon", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/34816-tales-of-phantasia-narikiri-dungeon\n"}
