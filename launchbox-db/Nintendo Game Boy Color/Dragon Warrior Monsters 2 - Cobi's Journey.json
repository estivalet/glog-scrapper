The island's prince, Kameha, and his ill-willed accomplice, Warubou, quickly confront the brother-and-sister team. Now, the dastardly pair has embarked on a plot to sink the entire island, and you'll have to train an army of Dragon Warrior Monsters to help stop the evil crime. This installment casts you as the brother, Cobi challenging you to find hidden keys and prepare all of your monsters for battle. There are more than 300 battling beasts in all, which means that you'll have your work cut out for you if you hope to effectively utilize your troops. As you wander through the land, you'll encounter different monsters, which you can persuade to join your team by offering up treats. You can also trade beings with other players who own the game or have a copy of DRAGON WARRIOR MONSTERS 2: Tara's Adventure (the parallel release, which follows the story of Cobi's sister).", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "September 15, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "TOSE", "publishers": "Enix America", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/8290-dragon-warrior-monsters-2-cobis-journey\n"}
