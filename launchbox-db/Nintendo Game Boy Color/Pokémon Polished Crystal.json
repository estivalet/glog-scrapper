{"altername_name": ["Pokemon Polished Crystal"], "name": "Pok\u00e9mon Polished Crystal", "overview": "Hack of Pok\u00e9mon Crystal Version by Rangi. Features: This isn't a complete list, just a summary of the notable ones. Pok\u00e9mon: \u2022 The entire Pok\u00e9dex of 253 Pok\u00e9mon can be caught in one game. Some Pok\u00e9mon, like Houndour, Murkrow, and Misdreavus, are available at sensible locations in Johto without having to wait for Kanto. \u2022 Added: Leafeon, Glaceon, Sylveon, Togekiss, Weavile, Honchkrow, Mismagius, Electivire, Magmortar, Magnezone, Tangrowth, Rhyperior, Porygon-Z, Yanmega, Gliscor, Mamoswine, and Munchlax. \u2022 Removed: Spearow, Fearow, Lickitung, Goldeen, Seaking, Hoppip, Skiploom, Jumpluff, Shuckle, Aipom, Stantler, Cleffa, Igglybuff, Smoochum, and Delibird. (I miss them too. :( ) \u2022 New evolution methods work, like Eevee evolving into Glaceon near Ice Rock, or Yanma evolving into Yanmega when knowing AncientPower. \u2022 Item trade evolutions (like Seadra holding a Dragon Scale) now evolve by leveling up while holding the item. \u2022 Machoke, Graveler, Haunter, and Kadabra evolve by having sufficient stat exp in Attack, Defense, Speed, and Special respectively (five Protein, Iron, Carbos, or Calcium is enough). \u2022 Magneton evolves into Magnezone near the Lodestone in Rock Tunnel. Moves: \u2022 Added: Aerial Ace, Air Slash, Aqua Tail, Astonish, Avalanche, Bug Buzz, Bulk Up, Bullet Punch, Calm Mind, Dark Pulse, DazzlinGleam, Disarm Voice, Dragon Claw, Dragon Dance, Dragon Pulse, Drain Kiss, Earth Power, Energy Ball, Extrasensory, Fairy Wind, Flare Blitz, Flash Cannon, Focus Blast, Gunk Shot, Hail, Hex, Hone Claws, Hurricane, Hyper Voice, Ice Shard, Icicle Crash, Iron Head, Metal Sound, Moonblast, Nasty Plot, Night Slash, Play Rough, Poison Jab, Power Gem, Psystrike, Seed Bomb, Shadow Claw, Stone Edge, Water Pulse, Wild Charge, Will-O-Wisp, X-Scissor, and Zen Headbutt. \u2022 Removed: Acid Armor, Amnesia, Barrage, Beat Up, Bide, Bind, Bone Club, Bone Rush, Bubble, Clamp, Comet Punch, Constrict, Conversion2, Cotton Spore, Detect, Fissure, Frustration, Guillotine, Horn Drill, Jump Kick, Kinesis, Lovely Kiss, Meditate, Mega Kick, Mega Punch, Mimic, Mind Reader, Mirror Move, Poison Gas, Powder Snow, Present, Psych Up, Psywave, Razor Wind, Rolling Kick, Sharpen, Skull Bash, Smog, Snore, Spider Web, Spite, Sweet Scent, Synthesis, Tail Whip, Vice Grip, and Withdraw. \u2022 Learnsets have been updated close to Gen VI, with missing moves replaced by similar, egg, TM, or event-exclusive moves. Battle mechanics: \u2022 The Fairy type, with the Pink Bow as its type-enhancing item. \u2022 Type chart, base stats, and move attributes all updated to Gen VI. \u2022 Physical/Special/Status split. \u2022 Natures (determined from DVs since personality values don't exist in Gen II) thanks to FredrIQ. \u2022 Gain experience from catching Pok\u00e9mon. \u2022 Play low-pitched cries when a player or foe Pok\u00e9mon faints. \u2022 Money loss formula from Gen V. \u2022 Shiny Pok\u00e9mon now have an odd Attack DV, 2, 3, 7, or 11 Defense, 5 or 13 Speed, and a perfect 15 Special; so 1 in 1,024 Pok\u00e9mon is shiny. \u2022 Type-enhancing items raise by 20%, not 10%. \u2022 Many battle mechanics have been updated to Gen VI, but not all. (For example, Waterfall has a 20% flinch chance, but sound-based moves don't bypass Substitute. Yet.) \u2022 Wild Pok\u00e9mon have more common held items (50% chance for a common one and 5% for a rare one). Giving an Amulet Coin to your lead Pok\u00e9mon increases this to 60% and 10%. Overworld mechanics: \u2022 Hold B to use Running Shoes, or turn on the Option to always use them. \u2022 Unlimited-use TMs. \u2022 Continuous Repel system. \u2022 Cure poison when it reaches 1 HP outside a battle. \u2022 Eggs hatch at level 1. \u2022 Trees randomly give 1, 2, or 3 Berries. \u2022 Surf at Bicycle/Running Shoes speed. \u2022 Maximum $9,999,999 money and 50,000 coins. \u2022 Maximum 30 items and 16 Balls in your bag pocket. \u2022 Bill calls to switch boxes when one is full. Nuzlocke mode: \u2022 Available in the Option menu at any time. \u2022 A fainted Pok\u00e9mon can't be revived, by items, Pok\u00e9mon Centers, or events. The only exception is your first rival battle, when you just have your starter. \u2022 You can only catch the first Pok\u00e9mon you encounter in a new location. \"Location\" is defined with the Town Map mechanics, so Sprout Tower is separate from Violet City, but multiple floors of Union Cave or multiple sections of the Safari Zone count as one location. And nothing is counted until you receive your first five Pok\u00e9 Balls. \u2022 Every Pok\u00e9mon gets a nickname, no asking whether you want to or not. Of course, you can cancel out to give the default name. \u2022 The dupes clause is in effect. If you've caught a Pidgey and encounter one on a new route, it won't count unless you catch it. \u2022 The shiny clause is also in effect. Shinies can always be caught. \u2022 Gift Pok\u00e9mon do not count as encounters. Static encounters like Sudowoodo, Snorlax, and Suicune do. Maps: \u2022 Restored locations from R/B/Y and HG/SS: Viridian Forest, Pewter Museum, Celadon Hotel, Silph Co., Pok\u00e9mon Mansion, Seafoam Islands, Cerulean Cave, Goldenrod Pok\u00e9Com Center, and Bellchime Trail. \u2022 Original locations, including Cinnabar Volcano, a new floor of Rock Tunnel, Cherrygrove Bay, Goldenrod Harbor, Route 35 Coast, the Ecruteak Shrine from Pok\u00e9mon Christmas, custom-designed Pok\u00e9Walker routes, and others. \u2022 Decorative features added to cities and routes, often from HG/SS. \u2022 HG/SS-style Town Map. Events: \u2022 Team Rocket has another plan to thwart. \u2022 Random Wonder Trades in the Goldenrod Pok\u00e9Com Center, including random held items and original trainers. \u2022 Catching all 26 Unown is worthwhile\u2026 \u2022 Move Reminder in the same house as the Move Deleter. (Code borrowed from TPP Anniversary Crystal, thanks to its developers graciously making their source code public.) \u2022 21 move tutors throughout Johto and Kanto. \u2022 Falkner is in Dark Cave, encouraging you to beat Sprout Tower first. \u2022 Photographing your Pok\u00e9mon at the Cianwood Photo Studio once a day now makes it happier, like haircuts or massages. (No more GameBoy Printer support.) \u2022 The Mystery Gift girl in Goldenrod Dept. Store gives you a random Berry once a day. (No more Mystery Gift support.) \u2022 The Pok\u00e9 Seer is replaced by the Stats Judge. \u2022 Lt. Surge's electric fences are back. \u2022 Celadon Dept.

(Suicune roams instead of appearing in Bell Tower.) (Also respawns Sudowoodo.) Trainers: \u2022 Lyra from HG/SS is your friendly rival. She battles you and gives you some items throughout the game. \u2022 The four Rocket Executives from HG/SS are introduced. \u2022 New trainer classes: Elder, Rich Boy, Schoolgirl, Cowgirl, Battle Girl, Hex Maniac, Guitarist\u2640, Officer\u2640, Sr. & Jr., Couple, Breeder, PI, Dragon Tamer, Ace Duo, and Roughneck. \u2022 Battle Lorelei, Agatha, Bill, Valerie, and some other special characters. \u2022 Battle Cal in Viridian City's Trainer House if you're a girl, Kay if you're a boy. \u2022 Rematch the Elite Four at higher levels after earning all 16 badges. \u2022 Rematch Gym Leaders and other special trainers in the Fighting Dojo after earning all 16 badges. \u2022 Battle Tower has new trainers. \u2022 A few NPC trainers have shiny Pok\u00e9mon. \u2022 Breeders can be rebattled like in B2/W2.

(Did this annoy anyone else when making huge maps of Johto?) Difficulty: \u2022 Default Set battle style. \u2022 Enemy AI doesn't fail an extra 25% of the time with sleep or poison-inducing moves, or 40% of the time with stat drops. \u2022 No badge boosts to stats or types. \u2022 Improved some trainers' rosters, movesets, held items, and DVs (particularly Gym Leaders, the Elite Four, and other bosses). \u2022 AI improvements, such as not trying to paralyze Electric types or burn Fire types. \u2022 A smoothly increasing level curve, with the final trainer of the game at level 100.

I know that not everyone likes this kind of change, so I've provided two ROM patches. The \"faithful\" patch keeps the canon Pok\u00e9mon stats and move attributes. Graphics and music: \u2022 Restored original Japanese sprites for Beauty, Fisher, Medium, Sage, and Swimmer\u2640. \u2022 Replaced Twins sprite with a devamped one from B/W. \u2022 New music ported from RBY and devamped from future generations. \u2022 Unique mini sprites for each Pok\u00e9mon (thanks to this patch). \u2022 Revised some shiny palettes (Dragonite is blue like Dragonair, Nidoqueen is pink like Nidoking, Scizor is silver, Espeon is sky blue, Electabuzz is red, etc). \u2022 Unown isn't the only Pok\u00e9mon with variant forms\u2026 \u2022 Color-coded starter Pok\u00e9 Balls. \u2022 Item balls for TMs are blue (inspired by Gen VI's yellow). \u2022 Surfing on Pikachu uses the minigame music from Yellow version. More tweaks: \u2022 Lowercase Pok\u00e9mon, moves, items, types, names, etc. \u2022 Fast text by default. \u2022 Stereo sound by default. \u2022 Third Trainer Card page for Kanto badges. \u2022 Fourth stats page for capture data formerly told by the Pok\u00e9 Seer. \u2022 Move stats include type, category, power, and accuracy. \u2022 Updated language (Pack \u2192 Bag, Enemy \u2192 Foe, Cooltrainer \u2192 Ace Trainer, Fisher \u2192 Fisherman, Elixer \u2192 Elixir, Pink Bow \u2192 Silk Scarf, new Berry names, etc). \u2022 Brass Tower \u2192 Gong Tower (\u304b\u306d kane can mean \u91d1 \"metal\" or \u9266, a gong-like bell). \u2022 Nidorina and Nidoqueen can breed, and will produce eggs of either Nidoran gender. \u2022 Fly to the Rock Tunnel/Power Plant Pok\u00e9mon Center. \u2022 The Mineral Badge, not Storm Badge, makes Pok\u00e9mon up to L70 obey, like in HG/SS. \u2022 The Zephyr Badge lets you use traded Pok\u00e9mon up to level 20, like in HG/SS. \u2022 Flash does not require the Zephyr Badge. \u2022 Fishing works 75% of the time, not 50%. \u2022 Always show numbers in Pok\u00e9dex, even in Johto order. All this and I haven't even mentioned some of my favorite additions.
