{"altername_name": [], "name": "Looney Tunes", "overview": "The Looney Tunes have been a staple of popular culture since the 1940s. Now, they have come to the Game Boy Color. You must navigate through seven stages that are reminiscent of Saturday morning cartoons. In each of the levels you must help a different character get through a tough situation: Bugs and Daffy must use Frisbees to destroy enemies and defeat the boss at the end of a stage; Porky pilots a spaceship to destroy satellites and an evil star that wants to eat him; Tweety must fly through his stage avoiding bottles and Sylvester; and Speedy Gonzales must enter an Aztec temple to defeat Dracula. If you love the Looney Tunes, then you need to get a copy of LOONEY TUNES for the Game Boy Color.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Sunsoft", "publishers": "Sunsoft", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.82", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Looney_Tunes_video_games", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21220-looney-tunes\n"}
