{"altername_name": [], "name": "Wendy: Der Traum von Arizona", "overview": "Wendy: Der Traum von Arizona is an action-adventure for children of any age. You play the party of Wendy, a German children's cartoon star. She and her friend Bianca are dreaming of going on a riding holiday in Arizona. To get the money required for it, they have to win horse tournaments. There are seven levels. They are divided into two types: There are action-adventure levels where you have to accomplish different tasks -- like helping your parents or shoeing your horse. To do this, you have to speak to different people, find and use items at the right location and succeed in some mini-games, all the while keeping a safe distance from evil animals (like sheep...) which hurt you when touched. Between these action-adventure levels, there are the tournament levels in which you perform in several different riding disciplines, often with some qualification stage before. At the end of the game, there is another arcade sequence in which you have to drive the taxi to the airport. If you have done this, you can enjoy the ending. After finishing the game, you can switch to a \"tournament mode\" where you can replay each tournament to get as much points as you can.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "2003", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "BVM Produktion", "publishers": "Kiddinx Entertainment", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/160785-wendy-der-traum-von-arizona\n"}
