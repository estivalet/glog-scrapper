You can choose from four different heroes and take control of part of a map. The goal is to defeat the other three warlords and rule the entire map. In order to do this, you must travel throughout the land, finding new areas and new towns. If you can get a town to help you, you can recruit new warriors and uncover information to find artifacts that will increase your powers and abilities. When you encounter the enemy, the armies square off in tactical combat where you can try to cut down the opposition with ranged attacks or cause status problems with magic spells. Destroy the opposition and rule the world in HEROES OF MIGHT AND MAGIC.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "April 29, 2000", "game_type": "", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "KnowWonder", "publishers": "3DO", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.62", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/16928-heroes-of-might-and-magic\n"}
