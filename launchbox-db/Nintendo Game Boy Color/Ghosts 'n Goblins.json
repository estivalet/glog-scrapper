{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ghosts 'n Goblins", "overview": "Capcom's arcade-turn-console action platformer Ghosts 'N Goblins is a true 2D classic. The game, which stars Sir Arthur, a knight on a mission to rescue Princess Guinevere, travels players through six huge 2D scrolling levels rained with obstacles, enemies and other infuriating hazards. It was all too easy to meet one's doom at the near end of a stage as the difficulty level is unforgiving and have to start all over, but because of the clever coin-munching design and atmospheric presentation, the drag to keep playing never loosened. It's still regarded as one of the greats. The GBC version, released in 2000, is a direct port of the NES game.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "January 1, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Digital Eclipse Software", "publishers": "Capcom", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.61", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghosts_%27n_Goblins", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/8294-ghosts-n-goblins\n"}
