{"altername_name": [], "name": "Scooby-Doo! Classic Creep Capers", "overview": "Jinkies! Join up with the entire gang of meddling kids (Shaggy, Scooby, Fred, Daphne, and Velma) as you try to crack three separate mysteries each based on classic episodes of the beloved cartoon program. Taking the TV episodes \"What a Night for a Knight,\" \"That's Snow Ghost,\" and \"A Tiki Scare is No Fair,\" the game runs the three stories together with a unifying plotline. You play as Shaggy, trudging through haunted forests, creepy basements, and abandoned buildings with your trusty pal, Scoob. Rather than having a \"death\" meter, as in most games of its kind, SCOOBY-DOO: Classic Creep Capers has a courage meter Scoob and Shag flee the scene if they get too scared. There are plenty of clues hidden throughout the game's expansive levels, but if you're not careful the bad guys might get to you before you can solve the mysteries. While the game certainly offers something for nostalgic fans of the series, it's a hilarious, original take that will keep gamers challenged as well.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "February 20, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Digital Eclipse Software", "publishers": "THQ", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.61", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21437-scooby-doo-classic-creep-capers\n"}
