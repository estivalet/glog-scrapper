{"altername_name": ["Ms. Pac-Man: Special Colour Edition"], "name": "Ms. Pac-Man: Special Color Edition", "overview": "All of the action and fun of the first feminist arcade game can be put in the palm of your hand with MS. PAC-MAN: Special Color Edition. You take control of the yellow disk adorned with lipstick and a pink bow, better known as the lovely Ms. Pac-Man. The goal is to guide her around the maze and eat all of the dots, avoiding the four ghosts that chase you. There are power pellets located in each corner of the maze which, when eaten, turn the ghosts blue. Once this happens, the ghosts can be eaten. Occasionally, fruit will float into the maze, which can be munched for extra points. If your friends want to play along, there is an alternating Two-Player mode. As an additional bonus, a complete version of SUPER PAC-MAN is included on the cartridge. Play as the first female arcade hero in MS. PAC-MAN: Special Color Edition.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "November 2, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Namco", "publishers": "Namco", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.07", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/8310-ms-pac-man-special-color-edition\n"}
