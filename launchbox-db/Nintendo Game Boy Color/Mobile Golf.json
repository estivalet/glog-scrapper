{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mobile Golf", "overview": "Mobile Golf is a Game Boy Color game released exclusively in Japan in May of 2001. It was the last game on the system to be released in Japan due to the Game Boy Advance taking its place. The game came with an adapter that allowed the user to play over the internet with others playing on mobile phones. The game was published by Nintendo and developed by Camelot, the same people behind the Mario Golf series, of which this is very similar. Like Mario Golf, it has four human characters to choose from at the beginning. They must be trained in the same fashion by playing golf in an RPG manner and gain experience. Players are also given the ability to unlock characters as well by beating them, such as the four champions of the game: Bean, Rozary, Powert, and Bird. Several human characters from Mario Golf can also be unlocked and played in story mode. Mario characters unlock that can be connected to using a mobile phone network, unlockables include Mario, Peach, Yoshi, and Foreman Spike.
