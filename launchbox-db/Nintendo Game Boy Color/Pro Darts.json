You can play as eight different characters (two have to be unlocked), each with unique ratings in strength, nerve, and accuracy. Once you have selected your character, use the Practice mode to learn the rules of the six different games Cricket, 301, 301 Double Out, Around the World, 501, and 501 Double Out. When you are ready for some competition, you can challenge the computer to a game on three different difficulty settings. If your friends want to get in on some of the action, you can challenge them to a game without having to use a link cable. No matter how you play, you must aim the dart and use a power meter to send it flying. Play PRO DARTS, and get all of the darts action you could ever want.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "February 7, 2002", "game_type": "", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Vicarious Visions", "publishers": "Vatical Entertainment", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.7", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21415-pro-darts\n"}
