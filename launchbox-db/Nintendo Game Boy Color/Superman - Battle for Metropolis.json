{"altername_name": [], "name": "Superman: Battle for Metropolis", "overview": "Developed by Neon Studios and slated to be published by Infogrames, this game was canceled after failing to impress the license holder for Superman. Regulations that were imposed on the character prohibited the developers from making the game they wanted, and so this prototype was created as a compromise to meet some of the demands of the licensor. The game remained relatively unheard of, as it doesn't seem like the game was ever mentioned in the media or present at any tradeshow at any time during its development. The game was presumably canceled around the time that this specific build was created and possibly never had an opportunity to see the light of day in any form.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Neon Studios", "publishers": "Unreleased Prototype", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0aOEwD70Ug", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/124003-superman-battle-for-metropolis\n"}
