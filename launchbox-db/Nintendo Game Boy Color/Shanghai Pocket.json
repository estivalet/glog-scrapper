{"altername_name": [], "name": "Shanghai Pocket", "overview": "Shanghai has been a popular PC game for quite some time. Now the game has come to the Game Boy Color with SHANGHAI POCKET. The game has a Mah-Jongg tile set arranged in an organized pile. The player must remove matching pairs of tiles, but only if the two can be moved freely. Removing all of the tiles or getting to a point when no moves are available will end the game. In addition to the standard Single-Player mode, there are two different Two-Player modes. In one, the players are given the same set of tiles and whoever clears all of them first is declared the winner. The other Two-Player game, removing certain combinations of tiles will cause new tiles to be dumped onto your opponent's pile. Try to become a master with SHANGHAI POCKET.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "December 30, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Sunsoft", "publishers": "Activision", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.56", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21440-shanghai-pocket\n"}
