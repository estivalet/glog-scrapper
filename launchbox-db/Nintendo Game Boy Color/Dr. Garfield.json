{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dr. Garfield", "overview": "Three kinds of ugly, nasty viruses are on the loose. But these germs are fun to catch. Garfield throws multi-colored vitamin capsules into the bottle. You can move, shift or spin the capsules as they fall. Arrange them to align with other capsules on top of the virus. If you can get 4 or more of the same color in a row, POOF! The viruses disappear! Destroy all the viruses in the bottle and you progress to the next round, where things get even more difficult. Play alone or enjoy simultaneous 2-player action, on your Nintendo Entertainment System, Nintendo Game Boy or Game Boy Color.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "November 19, 2020", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/372520-dr-garfield\n"}
