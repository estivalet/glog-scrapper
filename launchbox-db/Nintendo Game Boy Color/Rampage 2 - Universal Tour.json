{"altername_name": [], "name": "Rampage 2: Universal Tour", "overview": "Giant monsters are attacking the world's cities and you just happen to be one of the monsters. You can choose from six different beasts, including a gorilla, wolf, rat, lizard, lobster, and rhino. Each character has unique strengths and weaknesses, plus a unique special attack. Earn points by demolishing all of the buildings, downing helicopters, destroying tanks, and eating the helpless citizens. When you are hit by the human defenses, you lose power from your life meter. As luck would have it, health power-ups are located in each level, including a special food for each character that boosts their abilities. There are 100 cities to destroy, along with a Two-Player option that allows a friend to join the destructive action. Send the human race back to the Stone Age with RAMPAGE 2: Universal Tour.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "November 1, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Digital Eclipse Software", "publishers": "Midway Home Entertainment", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.77", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21422-rampage-2-universal-tour\n"}
