{"altername_name": [], "name": "Jimmy White's Cue Ball", "overview": "Jimmy White's Cueball is a pool game which offers the variations straight, 8 ball, 9 ball along with snooker and four opponents to play against (Broke Ben, Nine Nigel, Suzy Cue and Jimmy White). The game is entirely shown from a top-down view and offers no surprises when it comes to controls: first the player sets the direction of the cue and changes the spin by changing the dot on a miniature ball shown in the right hand corner. Lastly the power of the shot is determined with a power bar on which a line moves from the left to right (and vice versa) and the player has to press the button when it is at the desired position.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "December 22, 2000", "game_type": "", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Vicarious Visions", "publishers": "Vatical Entertainment", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/32807-jimmy-whites-cue-ball\n"}
