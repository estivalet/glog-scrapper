Each stage is fairly large and filled with enemies and minor obstacles, as well as keys to find. Gen has three different types of enemies - one will kill enemies, one will turn them into blocks, and one will anger them so they'll follow Gen around the screen. With this in mind, you use these tools to turn enemies into blocks and utilize them to hit switches or springs. Gen can also use his hammer to climb onto platforms, hop on like a pogo stick, or use as a umbrella to control his falls.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "April 28, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Biox", "publishers": "Irem", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.56", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammerin%27_Harry", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40987-daiku-no-gen-san-kachikachi-no-tonkachi-ga-kachi\n"}
