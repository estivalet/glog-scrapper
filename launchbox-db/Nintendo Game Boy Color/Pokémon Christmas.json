{"altername_name": ["Pokemon Christmas"], "name": "Pok\u00e9mon Christmas", "overview": "Pok\u00e9mon Christmas (originally called Pok\u00e9mon Skeetendo Christmas Hack) is a hack game based on Pok\u00e9mon Gold. It was done by the user Mateo of Pok\u00e9community and Skeetendo, Inc. Instead of being a completely new game, like other hacks intend to be, Christmas serves more as an upgrade of Pok\u00e9mon Gold, in the same vein as the Pokemon Generation's third version. The game follows pretty much the same over-all plot of Pok\u00e9mon Gold and other main-franchise games, but the events occur and are focused around Christmas time. Like Pok\u00e9mon Platinum, the game presents basically the same story but in a colder time. Even though the basic plot is almost the same as the original, containing the same cities and routes, the story itself has some differences. There are also some new Pok\u00e9mon from future generations.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "2012", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mateo", "publishers": "", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.44", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78631-pokemon-christmas\n"}
