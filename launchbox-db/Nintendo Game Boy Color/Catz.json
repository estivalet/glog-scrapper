{"altername_name": ["Catz: Your Virtual Petz Palz"], "name": "Catz", "overview": "Are you looking to adopt a pet but lack the time or space to take care of a real one? Then you may find CATZ to be of interest. Part of the small but popular virtual pet genre, CATZ lets you adopt a cat from one of three breeds: Siamese, Calico, or Persian. You can play with the pet first to decide if it's right for you. Once you've adopted the little gal or fella, it's up to you to take care of it: feed it, groom it, and play with it regularly if you want it to grow up to be a well-adjusted adult. If you mistreat your cat, your little pet will take off, never to return! Eventually, new breeds of cats and new special toys will become available for you, depending on how well you do. You can also trade toys and breeds of cats with your friends via the infrared link.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "December 1, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Saffire", "publishers": "Mindscape", "genres": "Life Simulation", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.86", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21269-catz\n"}
