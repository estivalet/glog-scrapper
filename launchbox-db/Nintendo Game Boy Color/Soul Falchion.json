Soul Falchion is a weapon-based fighting game using Takara's engine from their Game Boy The King of Fighters games. It has 20 characters, most (if not all) of which are based on characters from SNK's Last Blade and Samurai Shodown series, renamed (some with names taken from Mortal Kombat), slightly modified and recolored. The sprites are smaller versions of the sprites used in the Neo-Geo Pocket Color games. Its sound engine is stolen from Capcom's Mega Man 5 but the music itself is original.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "2002", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "", "developers": "Vast Fame", "publishers": "Li Cheng", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133079-soul-falchion\n"}
