{"altername_name": [], "name": "Rhino Rumble", "overview": "It's amazing what some animals will do just to get a drink of water. Take Rocky the Rhino, for instance: Positively parched (he ate way too many peppers at a local jungle party), the little fellow is willing to traverse 19 enormous levels in the hope of quenching his mighty thirst. Help the adorable Rocky get through seven unique worlds, fending off all who would stand in his way. Many of the jungle's inhabitants are convinced that Rocky will drink up the water supply, you see, so they're all working against you from the outset. Make your way through forests and caves, using unique artillery like fireball breath and belly jumps to squelch the attempts of your foes and get to the magical spring. In addition to your weaponry, you'll have the assistance of various boats, planes, trampolines, and wagons to reach the end of each level.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "March 29, 2002", "game_type": "", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Lost Boys Games", "publishers": "Telegames", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.42", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21427-rhino-rumble\n"}
