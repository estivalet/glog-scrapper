{"altername_name": ["Top Gear Rally"], "name": "Top Gear Pocket", "overview": "Rumble-enabled racer for Game Boy Color. As with any racer, Top Gear Pocket is split up into several tracks, only three of which are available at the start. As you rank highly in each, more become available, and, when you finish the first six, secret ones appear too. The backgrounds range from the standard City, Savannah and Grassland tracks, to the more unusual, such as Snowland and the very tricky Pole, where the road is sheer ice and the cars slide about everywhere. When racing, you are up against eight other cars, each one starting some way in front of you. In the time trial mode you're on your own.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "April 1, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Vision Works", "publishers": "Vatical Entertainment", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.57", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21470-top-gear-pocket\n"}
