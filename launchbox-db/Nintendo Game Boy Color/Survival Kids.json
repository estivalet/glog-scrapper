Unfortunately, your parents are nowhere in sight. Starting with only a knife and a broken radio, you must learn how to survive on the island until someone can rescue you. Food, water, and rest are your main concerns. Luckily, there are plenty of berries, mushrooms, and meat around the island and fresh water flows in all of the streams. As another stroke of luck, there are hollow trees that provide a comfortable place to take a nap. Rather than spend your whole time looking for food and water, collect as many items that a scattered throughout the island. Rocks, sticks, leaves, and other items can be turned into tools that will make your life easier. Try to survive until you are rescued in SURVIVAL KIDS.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "October 1, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Konami Computer Entertainment Sapporo", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.04", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_Kids", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IN0mLVn9r6o", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/9224-survival-kids\n"}
