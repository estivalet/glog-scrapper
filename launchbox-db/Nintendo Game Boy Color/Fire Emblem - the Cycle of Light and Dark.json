The battle and map sprites are ripped straight from the NES Fire Emblem titles, while the portraits are from the SNES titles. The game, which is only available in Chinese, spans 20+ chapters. One of the unique features of this game is a fairly well-built Skills system, which arguably outperforms that used in any Fire Emblem. Besides the lack of immediate creativity, flaws include repetitive music samples beyond the first couple of maps and a huge difficulty peak towards the endgame.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "2002", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "SKOB", "publishers": "SKOB", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/153170-fire-emblem-the-cycle-of-light-and-dark\n"}
