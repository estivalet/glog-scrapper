{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bob the Builder: Fix it Fun!", "overview": "Bob the Builder: Fix it Fun! is a game based on the British television series of the same name. Bob and Wendy are having a big picnic, but there is a lot of work to do beforehand. Each of Bob's friends has work to get done. Roley must flatten the road in time for the picnic. Lofty must save ducklings before they run off-stream. Dizzy must help Spud collect all the apples for the picnic. Muck must help Farmer Pickles fix his wall. Not only do the machines have to do jobs, Bob and his other colleagues have work to do. Bob must find tiles that blew off of the Town Hall roof, music sheets that blew off the bandstand, packages that Spud stole, and pieces to mend the fence. Bob must also feed Pilchard, the pet cat. All of Bob's tasks are platformer mini-games, with many different areas to explore and a key to unlock an area. These sections are based on health-based rather than time-based. Once all the tasks are compete, you must play as Scoop and collect all the things for the picnic. There are three difficulties; easy. medium, and hard, which change the difficulty of the mini-games (less time, objects are more hidden, etc.)", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "September 1, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Tiertex Design Studios", "publishers": "THQ", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21238-bob-the-builder-fix-it-fun\n"}
