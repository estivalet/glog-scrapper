{"altername_name": ["Space Fighter X"], "name": "Final Fantasy X: Fantasy War", "overview": "Final Fantasy X: Fantasy War (\u592a\u7a7a\u6230\u58ebX) is an unlicensed game for the Game Boy Color, loosely based on the Final Fantasy] series of RPGs. It was published in Taiwan by SKOB and in mainland China by Guangzhou Li Cheng Industry & Trade Co, although its developer and release year are unknown. The game is a side-scrolling fighter with four playable characters: a warrior with a sword, a chocobo, a black mage, and an archer. The B button is used to attack, with the former two having attack combos and the latter two using short-ranged projectiles. The A button is used to jump. The player can also run by tapping Left or Right twice. Each character has a \"desperation\" attack performed by pressing B and A together, at the cost of a little health. There are also two special attacks per character; they are performed by entering Down, Down+Forward, Forward+B (a Hadoken motion) and Up, Down, Up+B. Both special attacks consume some of the red \"magic\" meter. There are no items or collectible weapons; however, the player will \"level up\" after doing enough damage. This increases the player's strength, and it also restores their health and magic meters like a traditional Final Fantasy game.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Guangzhou Li Cheng Industry & Trade Co.", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133069-final-fantasy-x-fantasy-war\n"}
