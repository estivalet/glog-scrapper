{"altername_name": [], "name": "Walt Disney World Quest: Magical Racing Tour", "overview": "In WALT DISNEY WORLD'S MAGICAL RACING TOUR, the competition is fierce and the action non-stop. Something has gone terribly wrong in the wonderful world of Disney and it's up to you to put it right! That playful twosome, Chip and Dale, have accidentally sabotaged the magical fireworks machine, and in order to repair it they must speed through Disney attractions searching for missing parts. You take control of either one of the clumsy chipmunks (or a large selection of other Disney characters like Jiminy Cricket) and compete in bumpy, high-speed kart races across varied locales like Splash Mountain, Pirates of the Caribbean, Big Thunder, and the Jungle Cruise. Collect power-ups for speed blasts and special attacks, avoid tire-slowing traps, and drive over boost plates for an extra shot of swiftness. As you race you can listen to a classic soundtrack of favorites like \"A PIRATE'S LIFE FOR ME\" as you go barreling along. So wish upon a falling star and your racing dreams just might come true in the turbo-charged kart racing madness of WALT DISNEY WORLD'S MAGICAL RACING TOUR.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "December 7, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Prolific", "publishers": "Activision", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.93", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney_World_Quest:_Magical_Racing_Tour", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21190-walt-disney-world-quest-magical-racing-tour\n"}
