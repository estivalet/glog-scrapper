Or get that feeling of multiple bogeys closing in on your tail for a lock-on to blow you out of the sky? You've been contracted by a mercenary group to fuel-up, strap-in and snuff out the enemy.

Then get ready to grab some serious air!", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "November 21, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "The Climax Group", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.46", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airforce_Delta_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLvw1FBWF70", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21236-airforce-delta\n"}
