{"altername_name": ["Space Invaders X"], "name": "Space Invaders", "overview": "Aliens are trying to take over the solar system, and you're the only one that can stop them. You are the best pilot on Earth, and you must defend all of the planets. After choosing your vehicle from the three that are available, it will stay at the bottom of the screen as a formation of aliens slowly moves down the screen. Your job is simple: blast the aliens out the sky. When they are decimated, you will move on to the next level. Fortunately, there are several power-ups available including electricity, solar flares, bubbles, shurikens, and others. As you progress through the game, new aliens with new formations will appear, not mention a boss character or two. If you are lucky enough to make it through all of the game levels, you will be able to play a version of the original arcade game released in the late '70s.
