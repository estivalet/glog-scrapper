{"altername_name": [], "name": "Super Jetpak DX", "overview": "Your Astronaut is lost out on the furthest edges of the galaxy on alien worlds. Help them get home and not killed along the way, by deftly manoeuvring over the surface with your jet pack. Build the Rocket ship, piece by piece. Then fuel it and take off on to the next planet. Avoid the various hostile life forms, shoot them down with a well aimed shot from your laser gun. Careful to not drain your weapon battery too quickly, give it time to recharge. Collect power up icons along the way to help you, but avoid the confusion and death icons. Pick up treasures when you find them to help reach that high score. Can you make your way back home?", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "2020", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Quang", "publishers": "Pocketpixel Design", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/372023-super-jetpak-dx\n"}
