{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pok\u00e9mon Adventure", "overview": "Pok\u00e9mon Adventure is a bootleg platformer released for Game Boy Color in 2000 by Makon Soft. This game turns out to be a hack of Sonic Adventure 7, which possibly makes it the first game to hack an existing hack, Sonic Adventure 7 being a hack of Sonic 3D Blast 5 on the Game Boy. The intro in the game features screenshots of specific Pok\u00e9mon entries from Pok\u00e9mon Gold's Japanese Pok\u00e9dex, complete with the actual Japanese descriptions for each. The borders change with each entry as each screen is a four-color BG image instead of being comprised of various sprites and BGs like in the official Pok\u00e9dex from Pok\u00e9mon Gold, Pok\u00e9mon Silver and Pok\u00e9mon Crystal.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "2000", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "", "developers": "Makon Soft", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133082-pokemon-adventure\n"}
