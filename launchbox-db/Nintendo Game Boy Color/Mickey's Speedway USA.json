In the popular tradition of MARIO KART comes this adorable trip around the speedway. Choose from a list of your all-time favorite Disney characters, then rev up your engine and try to blast through the other lovable cartoon crazies in pursuit of first place. Mickey, Donald, Goofy, Minnie, and Daisy are all here, and you can play as any one of them. There are 19 different tracks in the game, so you'll have to practice a lot if you want to make it through all of them. The courses are spread across five circuits each in a different Disney locale. MICKEY'S SPEEDWAY USA also features an exciting Adventure mode, in which you have to save Pluto from the infamous Weazel bunch. If a day at the races with Mickey and his pals sounds like your idea of a good time, you'll love this zany game.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "March 25, 2001", "game_type": "", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Rare", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/8308-mickeys-speedway-usa\n"}
