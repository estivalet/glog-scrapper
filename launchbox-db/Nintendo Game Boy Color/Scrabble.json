{"altername_name": [], "name": "Scrabble", "overview": "What do you say? It\u2019s Scrabble, right? True, but not as we know it. Ubi Soft has finally reproduced one of the world\u2019s most popular board games for the handheld gaming community. Yes, this is Scrabble for Game Boy Color. Visually, there\u2019s really not much to say about this Game Boy Color version. The game consists of a series of white tiles each with their own letter and value. Is that enough for you? Oh yes. You know Scrabble. Seven random letters, make a word out of 'em, score points. Fall out with opponent optional. Seven lettered tiles it is then, with which you must formulate the highest scoring word possible. Clearly, letters such as Q, X and Z have a greater value, but the number of legitimate words that use these letters is limited. Once you\u2019ve chosen your word, you must place it on a board in a horizontal or vertical fashion. Certain spaces on the board contain score boosters that will increase the value of your chosen word. Triple Word Score is particularly useful. Your letter supply will then be replenished and you must repeat the process once your opponent has placed his word on the board. At the end of the game, when the supply of tiles is exhausted, the highest scoring player wins. So there you have it. It\u2019s Scrabble on a handheld, and it\u2019s brilliant.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "November 30, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Runecraft", "publishers": "Ubi Soft Entertainment Software", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.8", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/32825-scrabble\n"}
