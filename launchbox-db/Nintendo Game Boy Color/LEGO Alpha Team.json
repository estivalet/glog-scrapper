{"altername_name": [], "name": "LEGO Alpha Team", "overview": "The much-loved, interlocking, colored plastic pieces aren't going to get caught in the vacuum cleaner or make the dog choke anymore. Presenting a series of challenging puzzles to tickle your brain and keep your fingers moving, LEGO ALPHA TEAM lets you control Dash and his Underlings as they try to squelch the evil plans of Ogel. Redirect your team by placing stairs, trampolines, chutes, Changer Tiles, and other pieces on the board. You'll have a limited number of pieces on hand to complete each mission, making the action very difficult and the stress factor high. The game is full of great devices and items: two team members can seesaw or use anti-gravity generators, and there are explosive dynamite detonators, cutting lasers, and other items as well. A great blend of classic LEGO building and modern-day videogame action, LEGO ALPHA TEAM is a great way to give your brain a little bit of exercise and fun.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "November 1, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "The Climax Group", "publishers": "Lego Media", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.12", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21276-lego-alpha-team\n"}
