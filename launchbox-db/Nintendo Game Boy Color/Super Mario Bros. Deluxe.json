DX, was released on the Game Boy Color on May 10, 1999 in North America and Europe and in 2000 in Japan. Based on the original Super Mario Bros., it features an overworld level map, simultaneous multiplayer, a Challenge mode in which the player finds hidden objects and achieves a certain score in addition to normally completing the level, and eight additional worlds based on the main worlds of the Japanese 1986 game Super Mario Bros. 2. It is compatible with the Game Boy Printer. Compared to Super Mario Bros., the game features a few minor visual upgrades such as water and lava now being animated rather than static, and a smaller screen due to the lower resolution of the Game Boy Colour.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "April 30, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Nintendo", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.07", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros.#Super_Mario_Bros._Deluxe", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6Bm_jexH0I", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/8329-super-mario-bros-deluxe\n"}
