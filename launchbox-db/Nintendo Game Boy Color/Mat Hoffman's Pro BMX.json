{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX", "overview": "He might spell his name a little strange, but 10-time BMX Vert Champ Mat Hoffman knows his bikes. Lending his expertise to the creation of this game, Hoffman makes sure that every turn, ramp, and flip is up to snuff. Stunt biking has never been more exciting, as you choose from a list of professional BMX riders and see what magic you can make to out-duel the competition. If you can't handle the Vert competition, move on over to Dirt or Street tracks, trying to best your rivals for money and fame. The graphics set the game apart from similar fare, while the gameplay has to represent the most realistic stunt biking possible on the Game Boy Color. Hoffman proves that he knows all there is to know about the up-and-coming sport, providing every last detail of a genuine Vert competition without all of the scrapes, bruises, and breaks. Don't worry, though: if you're looking to get hurt, there's always the agony of defeat.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "May 14, 2001", "game_type": "", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "HotGen Studios", "publishers": "Activision", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.27", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/8340-mat-hoffmans-pro-bmx\n"}
