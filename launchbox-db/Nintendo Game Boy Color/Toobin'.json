{"altername_name": [], "name": "Toobin'", "overview": "Race down a river in an inner tube in the arcade classic TOOBIN' on the Game Boy Color. Your only goal is to beat the opposition to the finish line, but there are a large number of obstacles in the way including sharp rocks, crabs, and gun-toting hillbillies. Fortunately, there are several power-ups scattered throughout the game to help. For example, soda cans are weapons that can be hurled at obstacles to destroy them, patches allow you to recover from collisions, and beach balls grant invulnerability. Figuring out when to use these items is part of the challenge, as you race down 27 different rivers of varying difficulty. Fans of the arcade classic have something to cheer about, now that TOOBIN' can be in the palm of their hand.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "May 18, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Digital Eclipse Software", "publishers": "Midway Home Entertainment", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.8", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21468-toobin\n"}
