{"altername_name": ["Dracula Densetsu DX", "The Castlevania Adventure DX"], "name": "Castlevania: The Adventure DX", "overview": "Castlevania: The Adventure is a fan favorite Game Boy game that was included in Konami GB Collection Vol. 1. That compilation did provide a much needed color injection, however it was full of weird color choices and incorrect overlays on backgrounds resulting in a marred experience. This release intends to correct as many of those flaws as possible, increase the quality overall, and make the game a dedicated stand-alone experience. Changes include: Almost every enemy sprite has been re-colored in some way. The main character sprite has been redrawn and re-colored. The fully-powered whip fireball was given actual fireball colors. Candle color was changed, and the design was reduced in size. Color palettes for every level were altered to make the game more realistic, also resulting in better blending of objects into backgrounds. Health bar was changed to a solid red rather than a color changing system, consistent with other Castlevania titles. Inclusion of the \u201cautoboot+speed+whip hack\u201d by richirobot (with credits to tidi, hiro1112 and Ugetab). Removed the ability to reboot the game to the selection menu using Start+Select+A+B. Removed the ability to go back to the game selection menu at the title screen by pressing Select.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "March 3, 2023", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "ProstatePunch", "publishers": "Romhacking.net", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC_VVeeOjTw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/169825-castlevania-the-adventure-dx\n"}
