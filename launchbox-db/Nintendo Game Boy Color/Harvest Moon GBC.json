With only a shed of rusted tools and a small amount of money, you must prove yourself worthy of owning the ranch by returning it to its former glory. To do this, you must till the soil and cultivate vegetables. When you have earned enough money, you can add chickens and livestock to help increase your profits. While you work, you will receive visits from the local townsfolk, who will ask for your help. You should always help them as much as possible, because they will be willing to return the favor later. Once you have built your ranch to a significant level, you can trade it with other farm masters via link cable.
