{"altername_name": [], "name": "Missile Command", "overview": "This game is based on the original arcade game Missile Command, in which aliens are attacking the Earth. In this version of the game players control two anti-missile silos and have to shoot down the incoming enemy firepower in order to defend several different major cities (such as Cairo or Moscow) that have come under siege. Cities consist of six different buildings, which the player has to try and prevent their destruction. If all the buildings are destroyed, the player loses the game. Both missile silos are equipped with fifteen missiles each and can be fired independently of each other. Players aim their missiles by moving a cursor to the desired location. The Game Boy version of the game was later re-released for the Game Boy Color. This updated version included color graphics and added a rumble feature.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "September 1, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "The Code Monkeys", "publishers": "Hasbro Interactive", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.64", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile_Command", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOntaSUIK3w", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21394-missile-command\n"}
