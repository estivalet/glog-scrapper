{"altername_name": [], "name": "Maya the Bee & Her Friends", "overview": "Maya the Bee & Her Friends is the first game based on Maya the Bee, a world famous German book, comic, and animated cartoon series. This licensed title is based on the animated cartoon series. In the game evil spiders have kidnapped insects and asking for honey as ransom. It is up to Maya and her friends to thwart their evil schemes. The game has the player control three insects one at a time, but together on the same screen, Maya the bee, Willy the bee and Flip the grasshopper. Each insect has its own abilities. Maya can pull levers and Flip allows the others to leap to higher places. In each of the 120 levels an insect has to be saved and the three have to combine their skills to puzzle their way through the spider's web, in a similar vein as The Lost Vikings. The game was released in Europe only and is identical to The New Adventures of Mary-Kate & Ashley, but with a different license. The same engine was later also re-used in Mary-Kate & Ashley: Get a Clue!.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "December 31, 2000", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Crawfish Interactive", "publishers": "Acclaim Entertainment", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/28776-maya-the-bee-her-friends\n"}
