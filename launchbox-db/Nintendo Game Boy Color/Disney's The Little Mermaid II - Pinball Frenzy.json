{"altername_name": ["La Sirenita 2: Pinball Frenzy", "The Little Mermaid II: Pinball Frenzy"], "name": "Disney's The Little Mermaid II: Pinball Frenzy", "overview": "To coincide with the release of another Little Mermaid video, Disney has also released another Little Mermaid videogame. LITTLE MERMAID 2 PINBALL FRENY for the Game Boy Color is just what the name implies, a frenzied pinball game. There are two different boards that can be played on, each with several variations of their own. The Ariel board contains paddles that are put at varying places to throw off people too used to traditional pinball machines, and it makes them learn some new strategies. The Melody board has many different ramps and drop spots to create its own unique atmosphere. Each board contains eight mini-games that differ from simple actions to more complex objectives. The game also comes with a built-in Rumble Pak, guaranteed to deliver plenty of shaking to help make the game a more realistic experience. LITTLE MERMAID 2 PINBALL FRENZY delivers a pinball experience geared toward young players, but has enough gameplay and variation to please most any fan of the genre.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "September 24, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Left Field Productions", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.69", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21379-disneys-the-little-mermaid-ii-pinball-frenzy\n"}
