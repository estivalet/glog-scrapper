{"altername_name": ["Carmageddon 3"], "name": "Carmageddon TDR 2000", "overview": "The game was to be developed by Torus Games and published by SCi, using the same top-down 2D engine as the previous Game Boy game. It was touted to feature nine locations with two races and two mission levels each, making 36 levels. Twenty vehicles were stated to appear, rated by Speed, Acceleration, Braking, Strength and Cost. The physics engine and car handling were improved on from the original. Finally, there was to be a multiplayer \"link mode\", allowing two players to battle each other or play the game co-operatively. A trailer on the Nosebleed Pack disc stated that the game was set to be released 23rd February 2001. At some unknown point, the game was cancelled - while there are previews and a listing on the developer's site, there have been no reviews, mentions of its release, or copies for sale. The game was at 2000's E3 expo in playable demo form, but this ROM has not been leaked.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Torus Games", "publishers": "SCi", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/372997-carmageddon-tdr-2000\n"}
