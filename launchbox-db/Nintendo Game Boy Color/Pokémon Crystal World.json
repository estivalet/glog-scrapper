{"altername_name": ["Pokemon Crystal World"], "name": "Pok\u00e9mon Crystal World", "overview": "Pok\u00e9mon Crystal World is a hack that has some unique elements compared to the original game. Instead of having to battle Elite Four after gaining 8 gym badges, you'll be traveling to Kanto instead to collect another 8. After doing all that, you may go to Mt. Silver to battle Red. You may also choose Articuno, Zapdos or Moltres as your starting pokemon instead of the original GSC ones. All in all, it's really not a hack worthy of taking your time with but if you enjoyed GSC and like to see even major difficulty modifications in hacks, you should try it out and see how it is.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78630-pokemon-crystal-world\n"}
