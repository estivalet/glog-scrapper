{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mission: Impossible", "overview": "The rogue leader General Reznick has threatened to attack the United States with an arsenal of nuclear weapons. In addition, he has kidnapped several UN weapons inspectors. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to take control of Ethan Hunt, infiltrate General Reznick's base, rescue the weapons inspectors, and destroy the nuclear arsenal. This may sound impossible, but Hunt has a number of resources available to him including keys, guns, cameras, and a grappling hook. But, Ethan's greatest weapon is stealth. By staying out of sight and not killing the guards, Ethan can earn stealth points that can be translated into additional lives. Will Ethan be able to survive 10 terrorist-filled levels? Only if he uses all of his skills in MISSION: Impossible.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "February 22, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Rebellion Developments", "publishers": "Infogrames", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.93", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/24777-mission-impossible\n"}
