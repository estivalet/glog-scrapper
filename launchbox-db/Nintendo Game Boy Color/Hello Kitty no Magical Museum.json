There are two main modes in this game; \"GAME\" and \"MUSEUM\". In \"Game\" mode the player can choose to solve multiple puzzles with Hello Kitty artwork from flower, apple and star categories. These puzzles involve Hello Kitty automatically walking through a room which reveals parts of a puzzle for when Hello Kitty walks across empty space. Gates can be adjusted in order to make Hello Kitty walk in a different path. After the player solves the puzzle, it is unlocked in the \"Museum\" mode where it is able to be viewed. Different artworks in the Museum mode are sorted by year (possibly the year of release).", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "April 28, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Imagineer", "publishers": "Sanrio", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QY5eOjEID8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/102937-hello-kitty-no-magical-museum\n"}
