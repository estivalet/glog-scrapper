You can collect items in each level. In order to reunite with Kitty we need to clear the stages all over the world and get \"love points\". Upon accumulating love points it's possible to use various costumes and items, and enter a hidden stage. The more power-up items you get, the more high-score techniques of jump you can use, making it twice as easy to earn love love points. Mini games and communication function depend on love points.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "July 19, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "TOSE", "publishers": "Imagineer", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq97yGLfjeg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/117336-dear-daniel-no-sweet-adventure-kitty-chan-o-sagashite\n"}
