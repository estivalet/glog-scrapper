{"altername_name": ["Pok\u00e9mon S\u00faper Oro 97"], "name": "Pok\u00e9mon Super Gold 97", "overview": "Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver came out in 1999. Over 20 years later, people are still playing these games. Be it on traditional Gameboy devices or through emulation. Why not look at Pok\u00e9mon Super Gold 97, a ROM hack using Gold as its base? The 97 on the name is unclear, but regardless, this ROM hack stands out on its own. This ROM hack is based on Gold, and many of the story elements are the same as Gold and Silver. You are a new trainer who sets out on a journey to help Professor Oak with researching Pok\u00e9mon, very much like the very first games. This story is built on the foundation that was pulled from the demo itself, and has you traverse Nihon, based on the entirety of Japan, while you collect badges and catch Pok\u00e9mon. You'll also have to face off against Team Rocket, who are building a machine that would give them incredible power over Pok\u00e9mon! Silver is portrayed in the manner that he was in the demo - not as an antagonist, but as an energetic rival, kind of similar to gen 4's Barry. The story is admittedly kind of simple, but intentionally so. It was written to feel like the story that might have been in the demo had it been completed.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "February 4, 2020", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "lvl_3", "publishers": "", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/166710-pokemon-super-gold-97\n"}
