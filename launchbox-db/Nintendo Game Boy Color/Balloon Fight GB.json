{"altername_name": ["Balloon Kid"], "name": "Balloon Fight GB", "overview": "Take to the skies in a balloon to save your younger brother. In the little town of Pencilvania, there lived a brother and sister who loved to play with balloons. Alice and her younger brother Jim would spend countless days filling the skies with their balloons. One day, Jim filled all of his balloons and tied them together to make a beautiful balloon rainbow across the sky. But suddenly, a strong wind came and carried Jim away. As Alice, you must save your brother from peril. Float through eight different stages as you follow Jim's trail of balloons. Collect as many balloons as possible to earn bonuses. Test your piloting skills to avoid enemies, or let go of your balloons to face enemies on the ground. In \"Balloon Trip\" mode, compete for the highest score and move up the ranks. Take a big gulp of courage and give Alice a hand as she searches for her missing brother.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "July 31, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Nintendo R&D1", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.55", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_Kid", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MgtV7Uwwuk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/71557-balloon-fight-gb\n"}
