{"altername_name": [], "name": "DX Monopoly GB", "overview": "Monopoly is a popular board game by Parker Brothers, with a simple object: Be the last player standing by bankrupting all others. The gameplay is simple, in turn, each player rolls the dice, and moves that player's token the indicated number of spaces clockwise. The players can buy properties, railroads, and utilities in an attempt to speed up the bankrupting process. If all properties of a certain color are acquired, a monopoly is gained, and houses and hotels may be built on those properties. These houses and hotels can drastically increase the money others have to give the owner of these properties, or rent. Since there is only one of each deed per game, trading with other places is pretty much vital to winning.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "April 21, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "OeRSTED", "publishers": "Takara", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/117333-dx-monopoly-gb\n"}
