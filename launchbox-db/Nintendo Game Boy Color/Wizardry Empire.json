A sequel Wizardry Empire ~Staff of Resurrection~ using mostly the same gameplay-system, came out in 2000. Empire's engine is most closely based on Wizardry Gaiden: Suffering of the Queen and Wizardry Gaiden II: Curse of the Ancient Emperor, but like Wizardry Gaiden III: Scripture of the Dark and Wizardry Gaiden IV: Throb of the Demon's Heart it started incorporating elements of Wizardry VI: Bane of the Cosmic Forge, while retaining the core gameplay derived from Wizardry V: Heart of the Maelstrom. It also adds a significant amount of additions of it's own.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy Color", "release_date": "October 29, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Starfish", "publishers": "Starfish", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.12", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/55582-wizardry-empire\n"}
