{"name": "Double Dragon", "overview": "Double Dragon, known in Europe as Double Dragon: The Revenge of Billy Lee is a game that was developed and published by Virgin Games for the Sega Game Gear in 1993. Despite being called simply Double Dragon in the US and using promotional artwork from the first arcade game for the box art it is not a port of that game. Partially due to the choppy animation, this game is considered one of the worst games in the series. This version of Double Dragon was originally known as Double Dragon Xtra, though the \"Xtra\" name was dropped late in development.", "platform": "Sega Game Gear", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Virgin Interactive Entertainment", "publishers": "Virgin Games", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.06", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Dragon", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WD9_8o7_WE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21133\n"}
