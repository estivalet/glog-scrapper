Half of the planets are re-arrangements of the Genesis ones, and the other half are unique to this iteration. Some of Ristar's moves and various enemy mechanics have been tweaked or expanded. Also unique to Ristar on Game Gear are collectable mini-stars scattered throughout the levels, which award an extra life on collecting 100.", "platform": "Sega Game Gear", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Biox", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.35", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ristar", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFaHmJatCEg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/23718\n"}
