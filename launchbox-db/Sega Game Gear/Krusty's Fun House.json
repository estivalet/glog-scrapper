{"name": "Krusty's Fun House", "overview": "Hey, kids! Give a hoot! Help out your old pal Krusty the Clown! My official Krusty's Fun House is infested with rats! I've got my loyal cadets, Bart and Homer Simpson, Sideshow Mel, and Corporal Punishment to guard the rat traps, but I need you to lead the filthy rodents into those traps! Then we blow 'em up! We incinerate 'em! We laser-blast 'em! We electrocute 'em! We Krusterize the little stinkers! Hoo boy! Did I mention the snakes, aliens and flying pigs? Well, watch out for those riffraff! If you can't Krusterize 'em, at least avoid 'em... they're worse than the #@!*%! rats! Making Krusty's Fun House vermin-free is not a pretty task, kiddy cadets - but someone's gotta do it!", "platform": "Sega Game Gear", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Audiogenic", "publishers": "Flying Edge", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.2", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krusty%27s_Fun_House", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMAdqyRX1lA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/24528\n"}
