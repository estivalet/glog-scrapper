{"name": "Buster Fight", "overview": "Buster Fight is a versus fighting game, where you choose one of the final four participants in the tournament and need to defeat your three opponents and yourself in a mirror match, before you can take on the final boss. Unlike most fighters, the game does not use \"up\" on the D-pad for jumping, but one of the other buttons, leaving one button for punches and kicks. The game has three levels of difficulty, but the easiest mode ends after four of the five fights.", "platform": "Sega Game Gear", "release_date": "February 11, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "SIMS", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.56", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEqC9B1eQw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27594\n"}
