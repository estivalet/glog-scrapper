{"name": "Sensible Soccer: European Champions", "overview": "Sensible Soccer: European Champions is based on Sensible Soccer: European Champions: 92/93 Edition. The gameplay is identical: a fast-paced, top-down soccer game with emphasis on fast passes and simple control system. The main difference to the original is all content regarding custom teams is missing. However, in contrast to the 16-Bit version, all pre-set tournaments for national and club teams are still intact. It is also still possible to create own tournaments (cup or championship) with customizable rules with the available teams. The fake athlete names can't be edited. The proportions of athletes and playfield are identical in both versions, but the on-screen area is reduced on Game Gear.", "platform": "Sega Game Gear", "release_date": "November 1, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Eurocom", "publishers": "Sony Imagesoft", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.8", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/24525\n"}
