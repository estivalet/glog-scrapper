{"name": "Clutch Hitter", "overview": "Clutch Hitter is a typical baseball game which has all the Major League teams and their stats for the 1991 season. However, it does not have players names or team names. The game's look is similar to R.B.I. Baseball and it is based off on Sports Talk Baseball for the Genesis. The length of the innings can be determined to choose from five, to seven, to the full nine innings and when batting the screen splits up to see both first and third base to keep an eye on the base runners. The Game Gear version allows you to link two together and play against a friend.", "platform": "Sega Game Gear", "release_date": "December 1, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.83", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clutch_Hitter", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozPaw8ysemI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/23627\n"}
