{"name": "The Simpsons: Bartman Meets Radioactive Man", "overview": "Players control Bartman through 2D side-scrolling platform levels. He needs to defeat enemies, collect goodies, and be careful not to fall into one of the deadly traps on his way. Bartman can punch and kick, and collect lightning icons to shoot small bolts. Most of the level sequences require precise timing and pixel-perfect jumping precision. Bartman has five life points that are restored by collecting radioactive signs.", "platform": "Sega Game Gear", "release_date": "February 1, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Teeny Weeny Games", "publishers": "Acclaim", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.32", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons:_Bartman_Meets_Radioactive_Man", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/23614\n"}
