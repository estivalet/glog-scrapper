{"name": "NHL Hockey", "overview": "NHL Hockey for the Sega Game Gear is an ice hockey game released by Electronic Arts as part of their licensed NHL series. It is unrelated to the Mega Drive game with the same name, instead taking design cues primarily from one of the sequels, NHL 95. NHL Hockey was the only EA-published NHL game to hit the Game Gear (although a reworked version of EA Hockey came to the platform in the form of Championship Hockey, published in small numbers by U.S. Gold). A successor, NHL 96 was advertised for the Game Gear, but was not released.", "platform": "Sega Game Gear", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Realtime Associates", "publishers": "Electronic Arts, Inc.", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.14", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/24467\n"}
