{"name": "Super Star Wars: Return of the Jedi", "overview": "Super Star Wars: Return of the Jedi offers a good variety of action for a Game Gear game, with power-ups and continue points located throughout the game. Choosing from five playable characters and two vehicles keeps the game fresh, while simple controls (one for attacking, the other for jumping) make it a game anyone can get into. The graphics look very good for the Game Gear, with solid representations of our favorite characters from the Star Wars saga. Luke looks especially nice, complete with glowing lightsaber. Though the sound is not great, it gets the job done. Unfortunately, the fantastic Star Wars theme music just doesn't sound great. The ability to choose your characters greatly enhances the replay value, and the levels are long enough to keep most gamers busy for quite some time. Some are very difficult and require a lot of patience while performing precise jumping.", "platform": "Sega Game Gear", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Realtime Associates", "publishers": "Black Pearl", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.37", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Star_Wars:_Return_of_the_Jedi", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/5490\n"}
