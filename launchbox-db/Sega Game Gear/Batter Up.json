{"name": "Batter Up", "overview": "Batter Up is a baseball game for one or two players. It features a fictional \"Namco League\" consisting of 14 teams, each with their own player roster, with different players having their own strengths and weaknesses. At the start of a game, players select their team, their opponent, game length (5 or 9 innings), stadium (Park or City - City having higher fences, thus making home runs more difficult) and starting pitcher. During a game, players will control all aspects: pitching, batting, running and fielding. A variety of throws plus curve balls are available for pitchers and batters have the ability to bunt. Substitutions for pitchers and batters are possible. The game has a password feature, allowing players to continue a series of games. Two-player mode works via the Gear-to-Gear cable.", "platform": "Sega Game Gear", "release_date": "April 5, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Namco", "publishers": "Namco", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.94", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8YN7Dsw-K8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/23615\n"}
