{"name": "Evander Holyfield's \"Real Deal\" Boxing", "overview": "Evander Holyfield's \"Real Deal\" Boxing is a boxing simulation. Holyfield is the only licensed boxer, the rest are fictitious. Rather than a fanciful approach like Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!, the developers went for a more strategic sim. Differently from its Genesis counterpart, the game is played from a first or third person point of view, with the fighters facing each other directly. The player can choose to see the fight from his or from the opponent's point of view (\"through his eyes\").", "platform": "Sega Game Gear", "release_date": "January 5, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Novotrade International", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.35", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evander_Holyfield%27s_Real_Deal_Boxing", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yYPXkcz2Pk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/23496\n"}
