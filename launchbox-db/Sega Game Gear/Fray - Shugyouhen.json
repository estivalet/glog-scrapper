{"name": "Fray: Shugyouhen", "overview": "This is a top-down action game, which can be called a shooter of the run and gun variety, even though it is set in a medieval world. Fray can only use her staff, which works as a ranged weapon, casting projectiles. By pressing down the action button, it is possible to increase the size and the power of the projected missile. With the exception of towns, the screen scrolls vertically when Fray moves forward. Like in most shooters of this type, Fray receives damage when she touches an enemy or hit by its projectile attack. Fray visits towns on the way, where she can buy weapons, armor, potions, and magical spells.", "platform": "Sega Game Gear", "release_date": "December 27, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Micro Cabin", "publishers": "Micro Cabin", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.8", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fray_in_Magical_Adventure", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/66689\n"}
