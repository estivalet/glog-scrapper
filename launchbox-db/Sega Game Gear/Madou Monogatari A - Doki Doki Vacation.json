{"name": "Madou Monogatari A: Doki Doki Vacation", "overview": "The story of Mad\u014d Monogatari A takes place at a time between Mad\u014d Monogatari I and Mad\u014d Monogatari II. Arle, the heroine of the series, is a little girl who studies magic. One day, she goes into a forest, only to notice that something terrible happened to it and its inhabitants, the fairies. Is this the work of the archenemy, Satan-sama? That's what Arle has to find out! Like most other Mad\u014d Monogatari games, it takes place in 3D maze-like dungeons, which you should explore, find treasures, and fight enemies. The turn-based, random battles are viewed from the same first-person perspective as the dungeon exploration. You fight using a variety of magic spells.", "platform": "Sega Game Gear", "release_date": "November 24, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Compile", "publishers": "Compile", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27617\n"}
