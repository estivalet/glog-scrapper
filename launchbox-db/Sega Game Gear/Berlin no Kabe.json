{"name": "Berlin no Kabe", "overview": "Berlin no Kabe is the Game Gear version of the arcade game The Berlinwall. While the gameplay mechanics are identical, there are some significant changes. Foremost, the game adds a story: the player takes the role of a boy who searches for his mother who wanted to visit a neighbor town. Unfortunately, the only thing he finds is a huge wall. When trying to sneak through a hole, he is transported to a strange, hostile place... While some levels are based on the arcade version, others are different. This version also adds a shop where the player can buy power-ups.", "platform": "Sega Game Gear", "release_date": "November 29, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Inter State", "publishers": "Kaneko", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.75", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Berlin_Wall_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzzy0v72hL0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27595\n"}
