{"name": "Barbie: Super Model", "overview": "Barbie Super Model was announced for Sega Game Gear at Summer CES 1994, which was later cancelled. The goal of the game is to get Barbie around town (by car, on foot, etc.) to prepare outfits for her role as a runway model. At various points (or by collecting various items), you are told to make Barbie look like the picture of a magazine cover, which is made inaccessible to you (making each dress-up a memory game).", "platform": "Sega Game Gear", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bonsai Entertainment", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saXloembC_E", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/64996\n"}
