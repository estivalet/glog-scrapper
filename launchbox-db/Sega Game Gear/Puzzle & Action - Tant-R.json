{"name": "Puzzle & Action: Tant-R", "overview": "Puzzle & Action: Tant-R, often known just as Tant-R is a puzzle game developed by CRI and published by Sega. It is the first in Puzzle & Action series. Though the arcade version of Tant-R reached South Korea, the Mega Drive version remained exclusive to Japan and no versions of the game have ever made it to North America or Europe. Tant-R borrows its graphical style from Bonanza Bros., and is therefore often seen as a spin-off.", "platform": "Sega Game Gear", "release_date": "April 22, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "CRI", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.6", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puzzle_%26_Action:_Tant-R", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/71632\n"}
