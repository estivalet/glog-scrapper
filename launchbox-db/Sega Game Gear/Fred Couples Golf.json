{"name": "Fred Couples Golf", "overview": "In Fred Couples Golf the player chooses from one of four generic golf courses and compete in either a Tournament, Stroke Play or in Match Play, selecting from four different pre-set golfers, each with their own unique stats. They can change their name and as well as their shirt color and select from four different difficulty levels. Stroke Play can support up to four-players using Gear-to-Gear links. Fred Couples himself is not a selectable character, instead the player competes against him.", "platform": "Sega Game Gear", "release_date": "January 1, 1994", "game_type": "", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "SIMS", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Couples_Golf", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/24411\n"}
