{"name": "Griffin", "overview": "Griffin is a futuristic action game in which the player controls a tank. The goal is to beat four horizontally scrolling levels. The tank can be moved freely in order to shoot enemies and dodge obstacles. There are four weapons available: regular shots, torpedoes, grenades and a limited supply of smart bombs. Getting hit decreases the life energy, but it can be refilled by collecting power-ups. The reward for beating a level is a still picture of the female tank pilot.", "platform": "Sega Game Gear", "release_date": "July 26, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Telenet Japan", "publishers": "Renovation Game", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.38", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/18639\n"}
