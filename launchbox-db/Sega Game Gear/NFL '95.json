{"name": "NFL '95", "overview": "This is an official NFL-licensed football game for the Game Gear. It has several features that were pretty new for that time: An announcer comments on the events on the field, the viewpoint changes as you play the game, multiplayer action, and the roster includes 1500 players that were taken from the up-to-date 1994 NFL team roster with all 28 teams. You're not only in control of the quarterback - you can also be the receiver.", "platform": "Sega Game Gear", "release_date": "November 15, 1994", "game_type": "", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "BlueSky Software", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/24463\n"}
