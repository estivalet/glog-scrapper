{"name": "Soukoban", "overview": "In Soukoban, players control a warehouse worker whose job is to push crates on to predetermined locations. Each stage is set up as a puzzle, where the player has to figure out how to maneuver these crates into these positions without blocking themselves, as the crates can only be pushed and not pulled. The game tracks how many steps the player takes as they solve a puzzle, with the ideal solution being the one found that takes as few steps as possible. The game contains 300 different puzzle stages to figure out.", "platform": "Sega Game Gear", "release_date": "December 15, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Thinking Rabbit", "publishers": "Riverhillsoft", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.79", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxxle", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27649\n"}
