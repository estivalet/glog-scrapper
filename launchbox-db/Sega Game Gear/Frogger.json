{"name": "Frogger", "overview": "This cancelled update of the classic Frogger almost left the Game Gear on a pretty lonely pile of systems which never received their requisite amphibian auto dodger. It was set for release in the United Kingdom in November 1991, but the port was ultimately scrapped - it is rumoured that licensing issues caused this. Thankfully, the release of a completed prototype rescued it from that cruelest of fates.", "platform": "Sega Game Gear", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.71", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/24429\n"}
