Tarur\u016bto-kun, who can be described as a kind of magical super hero, flies through the levels while blasting away evil monsters.

Occasionally he meets his associate Mimosa which leads him to a separate screen where he can choose one of the unlimited weapon systems, e.g. enemy-seeking rockets or a multi-shot. On offer are also power-ups which can be used only a limited times like sleeping gas or a power scream.", "platform": "Sega Game Gear", "release_date": "July 5, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tsukuda Ideal", "publishers": "Tsukuda Ideal", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMcqyCvIEPc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27627\n"}
