{"name": "Donald no Magical World", "overview": "Donald no Magical World is a Sega Game Gear platform game. It features Ronald McDonald, mascot of the McDonald's fast-food chain. The game was only released in Japan, though curiously if the player inserts the cart into a western Game Gear, it will be translated into English, revealing a unused title in the process - Ronald in the Magical World. The game has many similarities to the Sega Mega Drive game, McDonald's Treasure Land Adventure, though the gameplay, story and level design is slightly different. Some of the music is shared between the two, however.", "platform": "Sega Game Gear", "release_date": "March 4, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "SIMS", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.46", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/24519\n"}
