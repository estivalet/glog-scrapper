{"name": "Pac-in-Time", "overview": "The evil Ghost Witch has cast a vicious spell on Pac-Man and thrown him back in time to when he was a Pac-Boy. Only you can save him now. Down some Pac-Pellets and get ready to battle your way through a totally supersonic side-scrolling adventure. Journey through snowy mountains and forests, collect fireballs and bubbles, crunch Pac-Bats and ghosts, swim like a fish and swing like a monkey... and ultimately get Pac-Man back to the real world! Sega Mega Drive and Sega Game Gear versions were announced at CES 1995, but were ultimately cancelled for unknown reasons. A prototype of the Game Gear version has since been found and released online.", "platform": "Sega Game Gear", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kalisto Entertainment SA", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.9", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-In-Time", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83292\n"}
