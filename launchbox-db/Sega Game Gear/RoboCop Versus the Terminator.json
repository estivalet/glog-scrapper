{"name": "RoboCop Versus the Terminator", "overview": "In the crumbling ruins of a world under siege, man-machine meets machine-man as legendary cyborgs clash to decide the fate of the Earth. As Robocop, you must travel across time into a bloody future ruled by the mechanical forces of Skynet. You'll face attack from every angle, every moment. An unwavering army of Terminators, robotic dogs, spiders, Endoskeletons and a relentless arsenal of automated weapons await you in this veritable hell on earth. To destroy this enemy, free its hostages and finally pierce the dark heart of a killer computer. It will take something more powerful than plasma rifles and laser guns: the human mind that still burns within you.", "platform": "Sega Game Gear", "release_date": "December 1, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "NMS Software", "publishers": "Virgin Interactive", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.22", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RoboCop_Versus_The_Terminator", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu2WbgP9hm8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/24518\n"}
