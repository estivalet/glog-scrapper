{"name": "MLBPA Baseball", "overview": "MLBPA Baseball is the only baseball game from Electronic Arts to reach the Game Gear. As the title indicates, it features an MLBPA, but not an MLB license, thus featuring real player names and statistics, but the 28 teams only have generic names. Feature-wise, it is based closely on the previous year's game on consoles, but with updated rosters for the 1994 MLB season and graphics and controls adapted to the handheld's capabilities. Available modes are exhibition games, playoffs, championship (\"The Series\") and a full 162-game season. Every game in a season can be played and season progress is stored via passwords.", "platform": "Sega Game Gear", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Beam Software", "publishers": "EA Sports", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/24461\n"}
