{"name": "Nazo Puyo 2", "overview": "Nazo Puyo 2 continues where the original left off. It contains 200 new puzzles to solve, compared to the 100 of the predecessor. Each puzzle is played Puyo Puyo-style, but with a certain goal to complete using a preset set of puyos, e.g. \"destroy all puyos\", \"eliminate 9 puyos at once\", \"make a triple combo\" and so on, thereby taxing players' Puyo Puyo skills and strategies. Another new addition is a battery backup, allowing players not only to save their current position, but also to save all puzzles that may have been created in the edit mode.", "platform": "Sega Game Gear", "release_date": "December 10, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Compile", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.08", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27630\n"}
