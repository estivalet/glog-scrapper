{"name": "Pop Breaker", "overview": "Pop Breaker is a puzzle game with action elements. The goal of each level is to destroy certain things. The basic way to do this is to shoot them, but there are various obstacles which need to be circumvented, e.g. mirrors which reflect shots; the direction is indicated by small arrows on the floor. Destructible blocks are distinguished by their colour, for example a purple block becomes blue when shot once and vaporizes after the next. Enemies are also capable of destroying blocks. Reflected own and enemy shots (along with mines on the floor) can kill the space ship, but extra lives can be earned by collecting power ups. One speciality is that the player can change the position of the gun; either left, right or central.", "platform": "Sega Game Gear", "release_date": "February 23, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Micro Cabin", "publishers": "Micro Cabin", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.29", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGnhaD4RyF4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27640\n"}
