{"name": "Super Momotarou Dentetsu III", "overview": "Super Momotaro Dentetsu III was the first (and only) game in the series to be released on a Sega console: it saw a Sega Game Gear port in 1995. It's the fourth game in Hudson's Momotaro Dentetsu series of train simulation board games. It plays similarly to Itadaki Street or Monopoly in that the player has to accrue wealth by purchasing properties and making other business deals that are often dependent on the square they end their turn on. The Momotaro Dentetsu model received a multitude of small tweaks and additions in this fourth entry but otherwise plays identically to its predecessors.", "platform": "Sega Game Gear", "release_date": "December 15, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hudson Soft", "publishers": "Hudson Soft", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/71657\n"}
