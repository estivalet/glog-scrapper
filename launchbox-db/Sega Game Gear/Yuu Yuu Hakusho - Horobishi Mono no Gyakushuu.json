{"name": "Yuu Yuu Hakusho: Horobishi Mono no Gyakushuu", "overview": "The game is a classic side-scrolling beat'em up and offers several characters from the manga to play. Apart from, as expected, Yusuke the player can choose between Hiei, Kuwabara and Kurama. All characters have different values in five attributes like jumping or speed. The game offers some variations from the standard beat'em up formula: There are four different levels accessible from the beginning and can be played through in any order. However, after completing a level, the player has to choose a new character he hasn't used yet for the next stage. If a character looses all his health, he has to fill it up with the health of the other characters and thus weakening them for the later levels. The game also switches to different mode for the boss fights.", "platform": "Sega Game Gear", "release_date": "March 18, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Minako Giken", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.62", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/18638\n"}
