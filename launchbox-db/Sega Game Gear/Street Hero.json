{"name": "Street Hero", "overview": "Janggun-ui Adeul (the official English title for the films is The General's Son), a gangster movie trilogy that could be called the Korean answer to The Godfather, to sum it up in one short sentence. Janggun-ui Adeul was renamed Street Hero and converted to a Game Gear cartridge for a US release by Innovation. The ad makes it look like the whole setting would have been switched to a modern day scenario, but actually only the intro text got changed. It remained unreleased like all Innovation games, but prototypes of this version exist and have been preserved.", "platform": "Sega Game Gear", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Daou Infosys", "publishers": "", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83296\n"}
