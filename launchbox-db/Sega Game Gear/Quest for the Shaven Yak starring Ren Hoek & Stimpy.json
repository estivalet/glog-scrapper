{"name": "Quest for the Shaven Yak starring Ren Hoek & Stimpy", "overview": "Ren and Stimpy just found a pair of hooves which belong to the great Shaven Yak, who lost them in the last Yak shaving day. Now they must find the Shaven Yak and return him his hooves, or there won't be any more Yak shaving days! In this platform game the player is prompted to choose playing either as Ren or Stimpy at the start of new life or some stages. Both can jump and shoot (Ren shoots toothbrushes, Stimpy spits), but each one has his own special ability: Ren can perform high jumps, Stimpy can smash things jumping over them. Each character starts the game with three lives.", "platform": "Sega Game Gear", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Realtime Associates", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.78", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quest_for_the_Shaven_Yak_Starring_Ren_Ho%C3%ABk_and_Stimpy", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgypXA109Is", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/24514\n"}
