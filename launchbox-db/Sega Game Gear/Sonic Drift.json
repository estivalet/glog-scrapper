{"name": "Sonic Drift", "overview": "The objective of the game is to win the three different Chaos GPs (green, yellow and red emerald). Each Chaos GP has six different tracks based on the original Sonic game levels' design. The players will race around a track against the other three characters for a top position, using 2 to accelerate, 1 to brake and the latter combined with a direction allows to drift corners, though abusing it will send the character into spinning out of control. Going out of the asphalt track drops the speed immediately and in the sidelines there are several obstacles that will stop the character altogether if they are hit. The Up direction on the directional pad can use rings collected on the track as a special move, unique to each character.", "platform": "Sega Game Gear", "release_date": "March 18, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.21", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_Drift", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27009\n"}
