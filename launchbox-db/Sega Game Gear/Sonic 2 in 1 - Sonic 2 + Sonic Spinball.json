{"name": "Sonic 2 in 1: Sonic 2 + Sonic Spinball", "overview": "Sonic 2 in 1 is a compilation of two Sonic games for the Sega Game Gear - Sonic the Hedgehog 2 and Sonic Spinball. It was a European-exclusive release and is hard to find today, even on the Internet on websites such as eBay. The method of switching between games is unique among Sonic compilation games, since instead of having a menu to switch games, it changes automatically when the system is power-cycled.", "platform": "Sega Game Gear", "release_date": "October 1, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.8", "wikipedia": "http://info.sonicretro.org/Sonic_2_in_1", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/24537\n"}
