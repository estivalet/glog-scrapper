{"name": "Magic Knight Rayearth", "overview": "Magic Knight Rayearth is based on the manga series of the same name, in which three Japanese schoolgirls find themselves in the magical land of Cephiro, where, as the Magic Knights of legend, they are tasked with rescuing the princess Emauraude from the evil Zagato. The game tells a side story set near the beginning of the girls' adventure. Their guide and companion, the rabbit-like creature Mokona, has disappeared into the Spirit Forest, and the three must venture out to find him. This quest is presented as a Japanese-style RPG, but with several unique elements. Unlike in many games of the genre, there is no main world map filled with towns and dungeons. The game world consists of a number of small interconnected areas instead. Scattered around the world are buildings like inns where the group can rest and the game can be saved, and shops where items can be bought. Other buildings contain characters that can give hints and advice regarding the quest. The game was packaged with a limited edition red Game Gear console, as well as sold separately.", "platform": "Sega Game Gear", "release_date": "December 16, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.56", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27621\n"}
