{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sennou Millennium", "overview": "Following on the heels of GUNPEY, which played a key role in the success of WonderSwan, this is the second in Bandai's Tsunagakure series of games. In addition to the element of connecting blocks, Sen-Nouroku adds a new element of surrounding them. Blocks that have become isolated and cannot be connected can be surrounded by other blocks to make them disappear. There are three game modes, which have become a staple in these types of games. There's \"Hashii Tsunami\" mode, in which you connect and erase blocks, \"Fight with Senno\" mode, in which you fight enemies that appear one after another in the story, and \"Sen-noudo\" mode, in which you use all the pieces available to erase all the blocks on the screen.", "platform": "WonderSwan", "release_date": "March 16, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kouyousha", "publishers": "Bandai", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27879-sennou-millennium\n"}
