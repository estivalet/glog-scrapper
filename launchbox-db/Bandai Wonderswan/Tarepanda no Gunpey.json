Tarepanda discovers the existence of other lazy pandas all around the world; wondering what other floppy pandas are like Tare rolls off in search of them. Each panda wears headgear associated with its homeland, top hat for Britain, turban for India, etc. When our hero is about to reach the new lazy panda something gets in the way, usually an incline too large to roll over. By finishing a certain number of lines you'll give your stymied panda the energy to jump the obstacle. In the story mode a number of novel hazards are presented. Your lines may flip angles, or parts of the screen may be entirely blocked out.", "platform": "WonderSwan", "release_date": "December 9, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bandai", "publishers": "Bandai", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.62", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27892-tarepanda-no-gunpey\n"}
