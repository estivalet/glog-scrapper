During battle, a simple system is used to give orders to a moving mobile suit. The key to victory or defeat is the ability to give precise instructions, the performance of the mobile suit, and the ability of the pilot. It is not always the case that the pilot can handle a tuned-up mobile suit. Combine your trained pilots with sophisticated mobile suits and take control of the battle!
