{"altername_name": [], "name": "Fire Pro Wrestling for WonderSwan", "overview": "The Fire Pro-Wrestling series has been a driving force in professional wrestling games since the days of the first PC Engine version. In addition to the One Night Matches, One Night Tournaments, Open League, and Elimination Matches that have existed in previous titles in the series, Fire Pro-Wrestling introduces a new type of wrestling event called \"Master of the Ring\". In addition to these game modes, the \"Wrestler Edit\" mode is still alive and well. Naturally, the game also supports a competitive battle mode, so you can enjoy battling with friends. With a total of 136 wrestlers and 900 different techniques, Fire Pro-Wrestling for WonderSwan is a game of a grade you wouldn't expect to find on a handheld console.", "platform": "WonderSwan", "release_date": "August 31, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Shimada Kikaku", "publishers": "Naxat Soft", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27826-fire-pro-wrestling-for-wonderswan\n"}
