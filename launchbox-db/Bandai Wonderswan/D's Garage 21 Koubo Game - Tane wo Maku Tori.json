However, his friend is a migratory bird from the south, who must leave for the south at the end of the summer.

The player must fill the town and fields with flowers so that the main character's friend, a raven, can return home quickly. You must guide the crow's seeds so that water will be distributed to the flowers and collect the droplets of water to kill the pests and fill the field with flowers.
