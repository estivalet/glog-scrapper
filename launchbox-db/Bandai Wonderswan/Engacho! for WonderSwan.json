{"altername_name": ["Engacho!"], "name": "Engacho! for WonderSwan", "overview": "Engacho! is based on a popular Japanese children game. A little boy named Sunzuki wants to prove to his angry father that he is not a coward and can stand up against the terrible monsters of the Oops Five group. Those five guys are extremely ugly and can contaminate him with an awful disease the moment they touch him. Suzuki has to run away before they can catch up. Enter a room with the Oops Five monsters and move in different directions, while trying to avoid collision. The catch is that each monster has its own movement style. One of them will always imitate Sunzuki and move into the same direction as he; another will, on the contrary, move into the opposite direction, etc. By planning ahead, the player must make moves correctly and make it to the exit before Oops Five gets the boy. There are different modes in the game, such as training, in which the player faces just one monster of the player's choice and get used to its patterns; puzzle mode, which takes the player through a series of rooms with different shapes and monsters; and battle mode, in which the player is thrown into large rooms where all Oops Five members roam freely. Gameplay is turn-based.", "platform": "WonderSwan", "release_date": "October 28, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nihon Application Co., Ltd.", "publishers": "Nihon Application Co., Ltd.", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27824-engacho-for-wonderswan\n"}
