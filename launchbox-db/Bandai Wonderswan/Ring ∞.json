{"altername_name": ["Ring Infinity"], "name": "Ring \u221e", "overview": "Ring \u221e is a spin-off of the cult horror film Ring. In the game you'll have the unfortunate experience of running across a VHS tape the contents of which will mysteriously kill the viewer seven days after viewing. The tape has been making the rounds at a local high school and students are starting to get used to seeing the petrified faces of their lifeless peers staring blankly up at them from all manner of unlikely places. The game is a text based 'choose your own adventure' game. You'll be presented with text to read and occasionally get a chance to make a decision. Occasionally you'll have to make a decision very quickly, e.g. you've just thrown a stone at someones window but accidental broken it, you'll be given your list of action and timed to pick one.", "platform": "WonderSwan", "release_date": "August 10, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kadokawa Shoten", "publishers": "Kadokawa Shoten", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27872-ring\n"}
