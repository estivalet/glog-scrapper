{"altername_name": [], "name": "Side Pocket for WonderSwan", "overview": "Side Pocket for Wonder Swan features one and two-player play on a single device. In the single-player mode the player chooses an avatar from a menu and needs to beat the remaining opponents. The player and CPU then take turns in hitting the ball. The main objective is to sink balls in each level and reach the predetermined scores to go ahead. But remember: you'll have only several \"lives\" and every error can be lethal. After each stage completed (and some luck), a bonus stage will appear, as well as the chance to earn extra balls. You will only need a good target in the parquet block!", "platform": "WonderSwan", "release_date": "November 25, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Data East", "publishers": "Data East", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27882-side-pocket-for-wonderswan\n"}
