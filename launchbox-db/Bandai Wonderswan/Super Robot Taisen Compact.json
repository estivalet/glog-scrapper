{"altername_name": [], "name": "Super Robot Taisen Compact", "overview": "First game of the Compact Trilogy, released on the WonderSwan first, and then, with a few gameplay differences, on the WonderSwan Color. Super Robot Taisen Compact for WonderSwan is not a port of a previously released game, but a completely original story. It uses a new system based on Super Robot Wars for the PlayStation and Super Robot Wars F for the Sega Saturn, that allows you to choose the order of attack for each terrestrial and space scene, as well as a new system that allows you to use the same attack order as the one registered in the Wonder One console. The game is packed with new elements unique to WonderSwan, such as the fact that your character's parameters change depending on your personal data.", "platform": "WonderSwan", "release_date": "April 28, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "TOSE", "publishers": "Banpresto", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27887-super-robot-taisen-compact\n"}
