{"altername_name": [], "name": "Densha de Go! 2", "overview": "The 1998 sequel of the popular Japanese train driving game by Taito has once again been ported to various systems. The gameplay is more arcade than simulation. The focus is on stopping at the stations at the perfect moment and position, keeping up with the schedule, obeying signals and speed limits, and ensuring the safety and comfort of the passengers. Mistakes result in points being deducted from a counter. If it reaches 0, the game is over.", "platform": "WonderSwan", "release_date": "October 7, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Taito", "publishers": "CyberFront", "genres": "Vehicle Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27817-densha-de-go-2\n"}
