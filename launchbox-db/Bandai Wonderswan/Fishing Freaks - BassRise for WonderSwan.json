{"altername_name": [], "name": "Fishing Freaks: BassRise for WonderSwan", "overview": "This is a fishing game that focuses only on bass fishing.

The player must drop a lure at the right moment and make full use of subtle rod manipulation and lure techniques to catch a bass. In the communication cable-based competitive mode, players can set up the size and weight of the fish in advance to match each other's fishing conditions, and enjoy a simultaneous two-player game. For beginners who have never tried fishing before, navigational messages are displayed during the game, so even inexperienced anglers can master all the techniques of bass fishing by playing this game.", "platform": "WonderSwan", "release_date": "February 24, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Media Entertainment", "publishers": "Interbec", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.38", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27827-fishing-freaks-bassrise-for-wonderswan\n"}
