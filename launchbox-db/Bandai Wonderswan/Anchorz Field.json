{"altername_name": ["Anchor Field Z"], "name": "Anchorz Field", "overview": "On a planet, a war is about to begin. The inhabitants of the planet have decided that the rules of war are to use the Anchor Machine to fight for position. You must use your anchor machine to unite 6 continents and 46 countries. The game is a new type of formation game in which you fly your anchor to increase your position. The rules are quite simple: use the anchor machine to fly the anchor back to your position in three shots or less, and you'll be in your own territory. However, you must quickly expand your position by watching the wind direction, terrain and enemy movements. This is a highly puzzling game that requires the ability to use a variety of anchor machines and strategy.", "platform": "WonderSwan", "release_date": "June 24, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sammy Corporation", "publishers": "Sammy Corporation", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27807-anchorz-field\n"}
