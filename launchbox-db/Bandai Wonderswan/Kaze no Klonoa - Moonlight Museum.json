As Klonoa's first handheld adventure, it is the first game in the series to place him in a fully two-dimensional world, and establishes the system that his Game Boy Advance titles will use. Taking place sometime before Klonoa: Door to Phantomile, Klonoa's first game, Kaze no Klonoa: Moonlight Museum stars Klonoa and his friend Huepow as they come across a young crying girl who tells them that the moon has been divided into fragments and stolen by a mysterious group of artists that reside in the nearby Moonlight Museum. Determined to help, the duo rush off to the Museum's entrance, and once they come inside, they are greeted by a painter named Picoo who traps them inside a piece of artwork. Klonoa and Huepow must fight their way through five worlds within the Museum itself before finding the source of all their troubles and restoring the moon to the sky.", "platform": "WonderSwan", "release_date": "May 20, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Namco", "publishers": "Bandai", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.38", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klonoa:_Moonlight_Museum", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsqozXActcY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27847-kaze-no-klonoa-moonlight-museum\n"}
