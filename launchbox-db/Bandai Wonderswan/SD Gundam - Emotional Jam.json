From all these Gundam series, more than 200 mobile suits and more than 200 characters have been gathered here! WonderSwan's display capability and 16-bit CPU power allow up to 5v5 team battles, huge mobile armor, and huge battleships to fill the Wonderswan screen. Various effects are included in the screen, and a battle full of speed and power is developed. A game system with a deeper strategy, a story that shows dramatic development, and the fun of nurturing growing characters, the fun of the game and the world of Gundam are a perfect blend.
