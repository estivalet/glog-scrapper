{"altername_name": [], "name": "Super Robot Taisen Compact 2 Dai-2-Bu: Uchuu Gekishin Hen", "overview": "Super Robot Taisen Compact 2 was the second Super Robot Taisen strategy RPG to be released on the WonderSwan. Like Super Robot Taisen F/ F Final before it, Compact 2 is split into multiple parts: Part 1 and Part 2 occur simultaneously, while Part 3 continues from Part 2. Using the WonderSwan's internal memory, players can send their clear data to each successive game; several events are altered based on the player's previous save, gained items are carried over to Part 3, and a special final scenario can be unlocked by clearing the entire trilogy within 777 turns. The game, like its predecessor, borrows almost all of its gameplay mechanics from F/F Final; however, it introduces the \"Support System\" which immediately became a core mechanic of the SRW franchise. In Part 2, Excellen Browning and the Londo Bell forces fend off enemies in outer space.", "platform": "WonderSwan", "release_date": "September 14, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "TOSE", "publishers": "Banpresto", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27889-super-robot-taisen-compact-2-dai-2-bu-uchuu-gekishin-hen\n"}
