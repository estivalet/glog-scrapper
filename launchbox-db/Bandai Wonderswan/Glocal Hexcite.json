{"altername_name": [], "name": "Glocal Hexcite", "overview": "Glocal Hexcite is a puzzle game played on a honeycomb-like playing field. Because of the turn-based gameplay, two people can play using only one system. Two-player link mode is also supported. Players compete to score the highest number of points by placing different geometric game pieces on a hex based board. The board is laid out with a hexagon in the middle and is surrounded by six identical sized hexagons. Each player has a set number of geometric game pieces such as hexagons, triangles, etc. and takes turns placing the pieces on the correct spots on the board. Bonus points are given to the player that completes filling in one of the seven hexagons on the board.", "platform": "WonderSwan", "release_date": "June 29, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gu, Inc.", "publishers": "Success", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/19004-glocal-hexcite\n"}
