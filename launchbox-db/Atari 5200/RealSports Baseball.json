{"name": "RealSports Baseball", "overview": "Join the Atari Aces in the World Series of video baseball--RealSports<br>BASEBALL!  It's a hot day in the ballpark--you can see the hot dog and soda<br>pop vendors making their way up and down the bleachers.  The crowd roars after<br>each pitch, and filling the stadium is the sound of \"STEERIKE!  YOU'RE OUT!\" <br>Down on the field it's a different story--just you and the pitcher facing each<br>other in an enormous diamond of brown and green.<br>The roar of the spectators fades into the distance as the pitcher winds up. <br>His arm arches back, his leg goes up, and...THUNK!  The ball flashes by and<br>hits the catcher's glove at 90 miles an hour.  \"STEERIKE!\"  Another windup,<br>another 90 mile an hour fastball, and \"STEERIKE TWO!\"  Gripping the bat<br>tightly, you stare down at the pitcher, see him wind up, and watch as the ball<br>seems to float in slow motion down the field toward you.  Everything falls<br>into place as you swing with perfect timing, feel the contact, and see the<br>ball sail over the right fielders outstretched glove and over the wall.
