{"name": "Ms. Pac-Man", "overview": "The gameplay of Ms. Pac-Man is largely identical to that of the original Pac-Man. The player gathers points by eating dots and avoiding ghosts (contact with one loses a life). Power-pellets or energizers change the ghosts, which reverse their course and can be eaten for bonus points. Fruit bonuses can be consumed for increasing point values, twice per level.", "platform": "Atari 5200", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Midway Manufacturing Company", "publishers": "Atari, Inc.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.21", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-upWtww9b4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4932"}
