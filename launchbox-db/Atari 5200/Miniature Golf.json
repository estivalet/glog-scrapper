{"name": "Miniature Golf", "overview": "Unreleased prototype game by Steve Baker for the Atari 5200. However it was completed and is fully playable. Due to the Hi-Res mode used the game has some odd choices for colors but other than that is quite well done and simulates Miniature Golf very well. <br><br>Control is handled entirely by the keypad, so the non-centering 5200 joystick doesn't hinder the gameplay.  Pushing the # and * keys changes the direction the ball will be hit (represented by an arrow) and the 1-9 keys are used to indicate the power of the swing (1=lowest and 9=highest).", "platform": "Atari 5200", "release_date": "February 10, 1983", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atari", "publishers": "Atari", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.36", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNJuO19kEgM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/34124"}
