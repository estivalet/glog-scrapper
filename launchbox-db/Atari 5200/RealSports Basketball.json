This version is what would become the final version of the game, which seems fairly complete, including easter eggs. However, like the Atari 2600 game of the same name, Realsports Basketball was never released for sale. It's unknown why Atari programmed two different versions of the game.<br><br>Sadly, Patrick Bass died in an automobile crash in 1998. Patrick's brother, Ben Bass, worked with Ken Van Mersbergen to ensure this final version of the game would be shared with the public.", "platform": "Atari 5200", "release_date": "May 27, 1983", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Patrick Bass", "publishers": "Atari", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21740"}
