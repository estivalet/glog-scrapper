{"name": "Gyruss", "overview": "Three billion miles is a long way from home. But there's no shorter route from outer Neptune to Earth. As if that weren't enough...it's got to be a shoot-out all the way. You alone in your rapid-firing spaceship, swirling in a circular flight pattern...orbiting to the right...arcing to the left...trying to mow down wave after wave of enemy plane formations, rocketing meteors and run-away satellites. Stops at Uranus, Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars will mark your progression towards Earth. Each one's a short visit, though. Then it's off again to the next planet--and the next wave of enemies. Reach Earth in one piece and maybe you'll think twice about leaving home. Then again...maybe not!", "platform": "Atari 5200", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Parker Brothers", "publishers": "Parker Brothers", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.39", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr00Yuy2rnE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4906"}
