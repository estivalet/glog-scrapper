The second part pits you against a whole bunch of nasty crocodiles in a mighty river. Fortunately, you have a knife to fight back with. Don't forget to go up for air! In the third part, you face a battle against oncoming boulders of varying sizes and physics. Once you've cleared all these treacherous hazards, you still must confront the dreaded cannibal, who is armed with a wicked spear. Can you get past him and save the lovely Penelope?", "platform": "Atari 5200", "release_date": "July 15, 1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Taito", "publishers": "Atari, Inc.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.21", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULTx81KjQYU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4913"}
