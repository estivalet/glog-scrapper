{"name": "Berzerk", "overview": "After a routine space exploration mission goes awry, you find yourself marooned on the planet Mazeon. To add insult to injury, the robotic residents are out to kill you. Now you're forced to fend off these relentless robots as you move through endless mazelike environments. In Berzerk, the goal is to make your way past the electrified walls forming each screen while using your laser gun to blast the hostile threats known as Automazeons. Firing your weapon involves pointing the joystick in one of eight directions and pressing a button. You can also lead robots into walls and even into their own shots to defeat them.", "platform": "Atari 5200", "release_date": "February 1, 1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Stern Electronics", "publishers": "Atari, Inc.", "genres": "", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.41", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4877"}
