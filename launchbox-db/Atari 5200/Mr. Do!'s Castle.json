{"name": "Mr. Do!'s Castle", "overview": "Mr. Do's Castle is an arcade game created by Universal in September 1983. The Asian title of the game is Mr. Do! versus Unicorns. Though marketed as a sequel to the original Mr. Do! released one year earlier, the game bears a far closer resemblance to Space Panic. It is the second of the Mr. Do series of video games, although it wasn't intended to be. It began life as a game called \"Knights vs. Unicorns\", but the U.S. division of Universal persuaded the Japanese arm to modify the graphics into a Mr. Do! game, taking into account the first game's popularity.", "platform": "Atari 5200", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Universal Co., Ltd.", "publishers": "Parker Brothers", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4931"}
