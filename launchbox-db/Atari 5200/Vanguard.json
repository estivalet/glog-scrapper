{"name": "Vanguard", "overview": "Vanguard for the Atari 5200 would be an exceptional port of the 1981 arcade game were it not for the control. While the coin-op has a four-button arrangement for aiming lasers, this version uses the joystick, meaning the ship fires in the same direction it is moving as long as the fire button is pressed. This is inexcusable, as each 5200 controller is equipped with four fire buttons (not to mention a keypad). As with many 5200 titles, this one responds sluggishly to the non-centering joysticks, making for a less enjoyable experience. Fans of the original will notice a couple of other differences between versions. The 5200's ship slows down when it fires and can be set to single shots or rapid fire in the options screen.", "platform": "Atari 5200", "release_date": "January 1, 1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "SNK Corporation", "publishers": "Atari, Inc", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.62", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTrM9c50H_0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4970"}
