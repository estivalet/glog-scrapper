{"name": "Chicken", "overview": "The player controls a small chicken with a cart at the bottom of the screen. A fox-like creature at the top of the screen will randomly place eggs upon a conveyor belt from the egg stash in the top left corner. These eggs will then fall through the conveyor belt, and the player must catch them in their cart by moving horizontally. There are a total of 15 egg drops per level, and after 15 drops the player moves to a harder difficulty level. If the player drops an egg, they farmer comes and takes their cart, and the player loses a life. If 3 eggs are dropped, it's game over.<br><br>This game was never released for the Atari 5200 but a homebrew version was created from the Atari 8-bit computer release.", "platform": "Atari 5200", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Synapse Software Corporation", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.62", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4886"}
