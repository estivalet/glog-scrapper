{"name": "Super Pac-Man", "overview": "In a very good unreleased adaptation of one of the lesser-known Pac-Man sequels, Super Pac-Man for the Atari 5200 speeds up the action -- and drastically shortens the effectiveness of the power pills and super power pills gobbled up by Pac-Man. If you think you've mastered the original arcade version -- either with the benefit of a lot of quarters or Namco Museum -- this version of Super Pac-Man may yet humble you with its faster pace. Graphically, this is a better translation of its source material than the original Pac-Man for the 5200 was, and the sound is almost a dead-ringer for the arcade game.", "platform": "Atari 5200", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atari", "publishers": "Atari", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYyt8T4rzp0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4967"}
