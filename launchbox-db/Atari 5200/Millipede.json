{"name": "Millipede", "overview": "An prototype conversion of the arcade game Millipede. It was completed in 1984 but never released due to Atari abandoning the 5200 near it's completion. A homebrew version was released in 2017 by Atariage.  <br><br>The goal is to survive wave after wave of various insects while trying to destroy a Millipede that makes its way down the screen towards your player. While very similar to Centipede it adds quite a few new quirks such as new insects to contend with and DDT bombs that when shot will destroy what is around them.", "platform": "Atari 5200", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atari", "publishers": "Atari", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgg8OHjPito", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/34123"}
