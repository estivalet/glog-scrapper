{"name": "Kaboom!", "overview": "Kaboom! is an unauthorized adaptation of the 1978 Atari coin-op Avalanche that was re-themed to be about a character known as the \"Mad Bomber\" who's randomly dropping bombs across the screen. The player uses a paddle controller to move buckets back and forth near the bottom of the screen to catch the bombs before they reach the bottom. As the game progresses, the Mad Bomber traverses the top of the screen much more erratically, dropping bombs at increasingly higher speeds, making each of the seven higher levels more difficult.<br><br>Kaboom! was well-received and successful commercially, selling over one million cartridges by 1983.", "platform": "Atari 5200", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Activision", "publishers": "Activision", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.21", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4914"}
