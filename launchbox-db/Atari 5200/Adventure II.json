{"name": "Adventure II", "overview": "This homebrew Atari 5200 cartridge is a direct, yet unofficial sequel to the Atari 2600 action role-playing classic Adventure. The player controls an unnamed knight on a quest to return the stolen chalice to the Seashore Kingdom's Castle. Like the original, Adventure II is played from top-down perspective, with player roaming the large game world.. The player character can carry one item at a time which are used to solve puzzles. While the main player graphic remains a square, the world of Adventure II is far larger and more robust than the original. The game's 32k cartridge features 4 distinct kingdoms, complete with unique inhabitants, items and secrets.", "platform": "Atari 5200", "release_date": "May 7, 2007", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ron Lloyd", "publishers": "AtariAge", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.21", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcJg7qupsXU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4868"}
