{"name": "Boogie", "overview": "As the name implies, Boogie is not a game but a music demo.  This prototype displays the 5200 splash screen while continuously playing a \"boogie\" tune.  The music is somewhat interesting, and shows off the 5200's music abilities fairly well.  It's unknown whether this prototype was made simply as a learning tool, or if some kind of music game was being planned.<br><br>Additional info: Boogie Demo, Atari, Music, 1982. Boogie demo was coded by Atari for internal use as a demonstration of the audio capabilities of the Atari 5200. The cartridge plays an impressive little boogie, then repeats. There is no game or graphics here, just the title screen and the musical score", "platform": "Atari 5200", "release_date": "2018", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atari", "publishers": "Atari", "genres": "Music", "max_players": "0", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.6", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6IgWv_z-4Y", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/80119"}
