{"name": "5200 Menu", "overview": "This strange prototype first surfaced in 2003 in a batch of common 5200 prototypes (well as common as prototypes get anyway).  As the name implies, this prototype is nothing more than a menu that displays the names of several early 5200 games.  Of the games listed three immediately stand out from the rest.<br>The control in this prototype is bit odd, it appears that only controller 4 has any function.  Pressing the buttons on the keypad causes the list to scroll down to a specific game.  Unfortunately the games themselves are not on this prototype...", "platform": "Atari 5200", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/136402"}
