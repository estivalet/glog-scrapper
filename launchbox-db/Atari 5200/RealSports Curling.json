{"name": "RealSports Curling", "overview": "It's the final shot of the 10th end, and as the skip of the national team, you've called a great game. The problem is that your opponents have called a better one. You're down by one point, and they've got two scoring rocks, but your best rock is third.<br><br>Do you take the safe draw around the left side and force a tie, turning over the hammer to your opponents in the extra end? Or do you go for the risky double-takeout and hope to stick the shooter, winning the game right here?<br><br>It's gut-check time and you and your vice exchange only a few words. The decision is made, it's time to win this championship.<br><br>You take your position in the hack and clean the final rock. The sweepers are ready, and with a deep breath you take the shot that will make or break your career. It has to get around that center guard and the line looks good, but the shot is too soft!<br><br>\"HARD!\" You and your vice both urge on the sweepers, hoping they can maintain the shot's speed until the moment of impact. It clears the guard by mere millimeters and the line is still true.<br><br>With a crash, the rock strikes its target and sticks! The opponent's rock collides into their other scoring rock, clearing both from the house.<br><br>You've done it! The world championship is yours!", "platform": "Atari 5200", "release_date": "2018", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ryan Witmer", "publishers": "AtariAge", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "8", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-zZbwRH3Pw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/153915"}
