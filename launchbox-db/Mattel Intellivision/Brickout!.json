{"altername_name": [], "name": "Brickout!", "overview": "[Unreleased 1981] An alien force field has blocked your only means of escape, preventing you from returning home. Your only hope is to use your supply of proton balls to try and destroy the field, one block at a time. Use your deflector to bounce proton balls against descending rows of energy layers. When a ball contacts the force field, it will neutralize that part of the barrier. But just when you think you're making some headway, more layers appear to seal you in. Just how much damage can you do to the force field before running out of proton balls? Features A one player action game. Blast your way through the mysterious force field. Take control and rack up a huge score! Wave after wave to blast through! Stay focused as endless layers descend upon you.", "platform": "Mattel Intellivision", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "APh Technological Consulting", "publishers": "Intellivision Productions", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.73", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AE9jAvX-PZs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/31401\n"}
