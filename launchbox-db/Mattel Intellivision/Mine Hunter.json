{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mine Hunter", "overview": "Take command of the advanced mine scanner aboard your helicopter and begin the hunt for all the mines laid down by the enemy. As you scan the minefield, drones will report back on how many mines are detected in an area. Use these markings to assist in finding all the mines. Hurry, your time is limited! The area that you need to clear of mines is divided into a grid of squares. Several of the squares will have landmines hidden beneath them. The goal of your mission is to identify where all of the landmines are hidden \u2013 without actually setting one off.", "platform": "Mattel Intellivision", "release_date": "2004", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ryan Kinnen", "publishers": "Intelligentvision", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGftre3gx2c", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/98111\n"}
