Included are three different racetracks of varying lengths, each with many twists, turns, and even some jumps. Be careful when racing, or you could skid off the track on a sharp turn or crash after a poorly timed jump! You can also use the track editor to create your own track to race on. For each race, you can choose anywhere from one to ten laps to be completed.", "platform": "Mattel Intellivision", "release_date": "June 1, 1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mattel Electronics", "publishers": "Mattel Electronics", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/10136\n"}
