Bump 'em...bash 'em...crash 'em off the road...before they bump you into the weeds! Jump over waterways and jump on cars to smash 'em. Watch out for obstacles in your way. Keep driving! Chalk up points for every car that crashes! Get bonus points for making it to the end of a roadway. Go for the highest score! Play alone or challenge a friend! Speed through 32 different roadways. Each one's harder than the last. Curves, narrows, water and obstacles toughen each course. Start with 5 cars. Get another when your score hits 20,000! Computer-controlled cars are out to make you crash and burn! The higher your score, the more aggressive they get!", "platform": "Mattel Intellivision", "release_date": "December 1, 1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Technology Associates", "publishers": "Mattel Electronics", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.77", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yzf_Q8xF1A", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/26107\n"}
