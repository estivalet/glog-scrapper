{"altername_name": ["D2K Arcade"], "name": "DIIK Arcade", "overview": "The follow-up to DK Arcade (also known as D1K Arcade), which was a stunningly complete rendition of Donkey Kong (1981), D2K Arcade is nothing less than the best home version of the coin-op classic every released for any system. There are two game modes in this immensely satisfying, professionally produced cartridge (no recycled materials were used), the first of which (Game 1, natch) is an excellent rendition of Donkey Kong (the same as D1K Arcade), complete with intro, intermissions, and all four levels of play: Barrels (a.k.a. Girders), Pie Factory (a.k.a. Conveyor Belt), Elevators, and Rivets. In addition to the standard Donkey Kong port, D2K Arcade features an indispensable, incredibly cool Game 2 (the default mode, since it's the primary selling point of the cartridge), which consists of five new game boards (plus two standard Donkey Kong levels), each of which incorporates classic components (along with some new elements), but arranges them in decidedly different ways for new challenges and thrills. New screens include: Twisted Girders, The Mixer, The Refinery, Triple Elevators, and The Eliminator.", "platform": "Mattel Intellivision", "release_date": "2012", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Carl Mueller Jr.", "publishers": "Elektronite", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YE76825nYyM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/156005\n"}
