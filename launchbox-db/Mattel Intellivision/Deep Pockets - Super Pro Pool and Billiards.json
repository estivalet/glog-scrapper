{"altername_name": [], "name": "Deep Pockets: Super Pro Pool and Billiards", "overview": "Deep Pockets gives you fast-breaking pool-playing fun in 9 different ways; all with music and realistic sound effects. This is the closest thing yet to the feel of real billiards hall action. There is no need to wait for a table so chalk up your cue stick and rack up those balls. Get ready, get set, break! The balls scatter and you are behind the 8-ball! It will take a steady hand and a sharp eye to clear the table. Play against a friend, or practice \"against yourself\" in 1 player games, you control both players 1 and 2. Player 1 will see prompts and scores in RED, and player 2 will see BLUE. When selecting 2 player mode, you will then be prompted how many matches you wish to play or up to how many points. Deep Pockets coaches you through each step prior to actually shooting your shot.", "platform": "Mattel Intellivision", "release_date": "1997", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Realtime Associates", "publishers": "Intellivision Productions", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.9", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQkchRPDoFE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27787\n"}
