{"altername_name": [], "name": "Adventures of TRON", "overview": "[Unreleased 1983] Welcome to the digital world. It is a shame that you were forced here. Are you thinking of trying to go home so soon? Not if the MCP can help it. You can run, jump, use elevators, and even catch a ride on the Solar Sailer but you can not hide. Give an escape your best shot if you want. Keep your man, TRON, alive and scoring points. Move from side-to-side and floor-to-floor. Send him up the elevators or jump him down a floor. Wave after wave of Master Control Program attackers, deadly Recognizers, Grid Bugs, even cannon-firing tanks must be avoided. At the start, TRON has 5 lives, 1 on the screen, 4 in reserve. You'll play one man at a time. Alone, your man TRON must avoid attackers on a grid with four floors. Avoid them by riding up the elevators and jumping down floors. Have TRON hitch a ride on a Solar Sailer! Points are scored my maneuvering TRON into position to intercept flying \"bits\" floating by overhead. Upper floor points count extra. Stay alert! There's no place to hide.", "platform": "Mattel Intellivision", "release_date": "2011", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "APh Technological Consulting", "publishers": "Intelligentvision", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.88", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6iM6fIX9Pw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/61984\n"}
