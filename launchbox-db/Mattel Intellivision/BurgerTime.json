{"altername_name": [], "name": "BurgerTime", "overview": "Your chef is battling for his life in the fast-paced world of fast food. He scurries up ladders and across planks in a frantic effort to build delicious hamburgers. Horrible hot dogs, evil eggs, and perilous pickles constantly try to surround and trap him. Dust those nasties with a pinch of pepper and stop them in their tracks. Gulp some coffee or gobble some fries and you store some extra pepper. Get through the seventh maze and you are a certified burger-maniac. Pickles, eggs, and hot dogs relentlessly chase your chef through the maze. Be smart and be quick but most of all, carry plenty of pepper. Give nasties a ride on a falling bun to score the big points. Watch out though! These nasties never die. 1 or 2 can play. Three kinds of nasties - pickles, eggs, and hot dogs - get quicker the longer you survive. You start with 5 Chefs. Get another for each 10,000 points you score. Score points by dropping buns, lettuce, tomatoes, and patties. Rack up the big points by squashing the nasties or better yet giving them a ride down on a falling ingredient. Seven mazes requiring inventive strategies to master. A visual feast for the computer game gourmet!", "platform": "Mattel Intellivision", "release_date": "January 1, 1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mattel Electronics", "publishers": "Mattel Electronics", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.18", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7Pijj7Ty9E", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/3842\n"}
