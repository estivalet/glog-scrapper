{"altername_name": [], "name": "Star Strike", "overview": "Star Strike was clearly inspired by the Death Star battle sequence in the movie Star Wars. You fly a space craft into the enemy launch trench. Your mission: to destroy the alien station before Earth passes directly over the launch trench. You must evade the alien ships that are defending the launch trench while being sure to bomb the red \"Hot Targets\". The very first red target that is missed when the Earth is directly in the middle of the launch trench becomes a missile. The missile is launched and destroys Earth.", "platform": "Mattel Intellivision", "release_date": "December 22, 1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "APh Technological Consulting", "publishers": "Mattel Electronics", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Strike", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqZH_yaPKoM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/3876\n"}
