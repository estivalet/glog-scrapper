{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hypnotic Lights", "overview": "A puzzle game -- move rows and columns of squares to line up matching colors. While experimenting with Intellivision graphics, someone in the Design & Development department came up with a kaleidoscopic effect using sequenced GRAM. VP of Applications Software Gabriel Baum liked the effect, dubbed Hypnotic Lights, and asked programmer Steve Roney (Space Spartans) to work it into a game. Steve's reaction was pretty much: yeah, right, what game? Marketing had a suggestion: something sort of kind of like a Rubik's Cube. That's what Steve sort of kind of gave them. But while Steve continued to tinker with it when not working on higher priority games (including B-17 Bomber, Aquarius Utopia and Space Shuttle), Hypnotic Lights was never elevated to \"official\" status.", "platform": "Mattel Intellivision", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mattel Electronics", "publishers": "Mattel Electronics", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA4ZLK4UvAk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/81539\n"}
