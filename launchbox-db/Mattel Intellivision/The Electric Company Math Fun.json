Each player controls a gorilla which is wandering through the jungle. As the gorilla walks on, it will encounter a creature which has a math problem with it. You need to enter in the correct answer to the problem as quickly as possible. If you get the answer correct, your gorilla may continue on. If you get the answer wrong, then your gorilla must jump into the river. Your gorilla is unable to leave the river and continue on until you answer another math problem correctly. The goal is to correctly answer as many of the problems as you can in the shortest amount of time. The game includes eighteen different levels of difficulty which can be set individually for each player.", "platform": "Mattel Intellivision", "release_date": "December 1, 1979", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "APh Technological Consulting", "publishers": "Mattel Electronics", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.64", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J8wk8Vl0oM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/10120\n"}
