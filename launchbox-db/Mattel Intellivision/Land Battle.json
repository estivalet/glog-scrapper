Each player controls an array of forces with the objective of capturing or destroying his opponent's \"flag.\" The game can be played on any of thousands of different countryside maps -- the first thousand of which are selectable at the beginning of the game. All of these maps show roads, towns, hills, lakes, forests, orchards, and fields, and these geographic features impose restrictions and necessitate clever planning on the part of the player. Completed in mid-1982, Mattel decided not to release the Game.", "platform": "Mattel Intellivision", "release_date": "1998", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "APh Technological Consulting", "publishers": "Intellivision Productions", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.7", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/61576\n"}
