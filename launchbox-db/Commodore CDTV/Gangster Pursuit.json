{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gangster Pursuit", "overview": "This would, on the face of it, appear to be a racing game but it is much, much less. It is essentially a random outcome generator that allows you to bet on the winner of the race, which like Camel Racing, is randomly selected by the computer, making all races different. The initial intent was to have a bar environment where people would buy tickets that and would win cash or raffle tickets or prizes based on the outcome of the races, with a raffle taking place before or after the last run to drive ticket sales and bar visits! This along with the associated Bingo and Karaoke games intended to update and modernize the BINGO\\Bar Scene of the time.", "platform": "Commodore CDTV", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "John Blackburn", "publishers": "MMMGroup", "genres": "Casino", "max_players": "6", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1wddGf2EYY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/87966-gangster-pursuit\n"}
