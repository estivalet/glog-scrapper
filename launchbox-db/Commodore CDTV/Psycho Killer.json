The game involves an unnamed protagonist going on a quest in order to save a woman from a murderer, and to save himself. The graphics for the game were created using digitised still photographs that were taken in the suburbs of London. Gameplay of Psycho Killer is restricted to a point-and-click interface, such as clicking certain arrows to go their respective direction. There are multiple times in the game where the player must respond promptly to a quick time event in order to proceed to the next scene. Failure to do so can result in the game ending with the protagonist's death.", "platform": "Commodore CDTV", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Delta 4 Interactive", "publishers": "On-Line Entertainment", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYd7quRbu0Q", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90429-psycho-killer\n"}
