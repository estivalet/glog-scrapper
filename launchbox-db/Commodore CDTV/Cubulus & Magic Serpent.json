{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cubulus & Magic Serpent", "overview": "Cubulus: How do you make an interesting computer game out of the venerable Rubik's Cube concept? According to cult programmer Tobias Richter, you view it from the top with all sides displayed, and allow the player to choose the number of sides, from 4 to 25. A large number of different starting arrangements are offered, grouped by difficulty. Rather than having a level-based progression, you can choose any of these from the start. A number of different tunes are provided, written by Team 17 cohort Bj\u00f8rn Lynne. Magic Serpent: Magic Serpent is a Snake variant that combines Snake with some aspects of Pac-Man. The player controls a snake called Lenni who has to eat all fruits which are divided over the scrolling level. Said levels are constructed like mazes, i.e. many small gangways. Every time a fruit is eaten, the length of Lenni grows. The player needs to control Lenni (he moves and turns automatically when meeting a wall; the player only needs to intervene when another turn is in order) in a way so he does get in his own way. Each level has to be completed within 60 seconds, but collecting clocks extends this limit. Other power-ups are rabbits (make Lenni faster) , snails (make Lenni slower, but no slower than the default speed), axes (the length of Lenni gets cut back to the starting value) and teleports to the starting point of the level. Each power-up also affects the points.", "platform": "Commodore CDTV", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Software 2000", "publishers": "Software 2000", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.12", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/87940-cubulus-magic-serpent\n"}
