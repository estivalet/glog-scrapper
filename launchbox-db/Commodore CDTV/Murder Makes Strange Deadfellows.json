{"altername_name": [], "name": "Murder Makes Strange Deadfellows", "overview": "Another hard to find game from the same company that developed The Case of the Cautious Condor. In this murder mystery you guide Nick, great-nephew of the late Randolph Steere, through the rooms of the haunted Steere mansion. Nick aims to find out where is the last Randolph's will, and how did he really died. There is a limited time for gathering clues through observations and talking and listen to people. Game play is non linear but, because of the time limit, you must be careful when choosing options. The graphics recall the comic book style, no animations, just pictures with voices and music.", "platform": "Commodore CDTV", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tiger Media", "publishers": "Tiger Media", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.12", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/87967-murder-makes-strange-deadfellows\n"}
