{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ultimate Basketball", "overview": "Now for the first time a 5-on-5 Multimedia Basketball Simulation. Experience the thrills of the arena in your own living room. Control your teams offense and defensive strategies. What'll it be, full court press, man-to-man or zone. Run your fast break 0, play for three or run down the clock? Lace up your high tops and get into the action yourself. You control your center! Do you want to post-up, set a pick, attempt a sky-hook or the old stand-by, a jump shot? Make sure on D you get your share of the boards. Or .... let the two coaches go at it themselves and just sit back and watch the action unfold. Ultimate Basketball allows you to join in the action on the floor, coach from the sidelines, do a little of both and even set the game to play itself. Whatever you chose, Ultimate Basket-ball will keep you on the edge of your seat or should that be the edge of the bench! Even a halftime show! Watch the cheerleaders heat up the hardwood. You won't want to miss it!", "platform": "Commodore CDTV", "release_date": "September 1, 1990", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Aicom", "publishers": "American Sammy", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/88025-ultimate-basketball\n"}
