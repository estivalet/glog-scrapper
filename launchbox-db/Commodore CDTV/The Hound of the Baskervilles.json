{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Hound of the Baskervilles", "overview": "This is an interactive murder mystery, apparently. In actual fact it's more of an interactive storybook, in which the story of Sherlock Holmes' most famous case is broken down into small chunks. It's based on an idea for presenting a murder mystery developed by a book publisher a number of years ago. You are given the book as a kind of crime file and you are encouraged to read it through event-by-event and try to develop your own idea of the solution. On CD, this means you must navigate your way through huge wodges of on-screen text and look at the odd digitised photograph. It's a terrible way of reading a book and it does not add any real element of interactive enjoyment. On top of which, the presentation is dire apart from the employing of a professional narrator.", "platform": "Commodore CDTV", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "On-Line Entertainment", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvpHINjdwgc&ab_channel=OldGamesDatabase", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/87957-the-hound-of-the-baskervilles\n"}
