The pyramids on earth are malfunctioning devices of alien origin with enough energy to destroy earth. And it's up to Vick to switch off the core functions of El Giza. The game consists of six pyramids each with its own wall engravings and color pattern; every pyramid contains 10 levels. The idea of the game is to collect crystals called soul stones in each level by solving the different puzzles and evading or killing the enemies using the many tools and weapons available to unlock the exit door that will take you to the next level. The game was released both for the MSX1 and MSX2 systems. The MSX2 version only saw a release in Japan. The MSX 2 version was the same game except minor changes like the music was remixed and some of the items and backgrounds recolored.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX2", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Valley_II", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8-3QXOGkf8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/68562-ouke-no-tani-el-giza-no-fuuin\n"}
