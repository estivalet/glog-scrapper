{"altername_name": [], "name": "Matrix: Quest for Deliverance", "overview": "Remember those golden years, with the bat like device scrolling from side to side at the bottom of the screen, bouncing an orb back and forth, smashing blocks and gaining power ups? It just had to be Arkanoid; an arcade game first developed by Taito in 1986, expanded from Atari's breakout that has now been cloned for the MSX. Two decades later from the original release, Javier Lavandeira coded a great Arkanoid clone for the MSX with fine Moonblaster music, however it was only for friends. Yet this week all of you can now play Matrix: Quest for Deliverance a brilliant Arkanoid clone that's regarded as one of the best homebrew releases for the MSX \" Here\u2019s a game for MSX2 computers that I released on October 1994. It was never released commercially, but I gave copies to friends. I\u2019m now releasing it to the public domain.The game is just another Breakout / Arkanoid clone. It has great FM-PAC / Music Module music composed by Carlos Garc\u00eda. I\u2019m guilty of all the coding and graphics.\" (MSX.org)", "platform": "Microsoft MSX2", "release_date": "October 30, 1994", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Javier Lavandeira", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/101478-matrix-quest-for-deliverance\n"}
