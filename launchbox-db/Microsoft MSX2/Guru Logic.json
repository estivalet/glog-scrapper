{"altername_name": [], "name": "Guru Logic", "overview": "This thinking game, released in 2002 by TeddyWareZ, has a big success in the MSX community, not only because its concept is pleasant but also because it was removed from Internet after some months on special request from Compile/Aiky, the publisher of the original version for Game Boy Advance. It can be seen as a compliment for the MSX coders ! An official version with more contents should appear some day for the MSX system ! The goal of the game is the rebuilding of a matrix by placing bricks at the good location. To do that, you control a canon held by two ducks. Of course, some obstacles are waiting for you : the gray solid bricks can't be moved to another location, the white bricks must be replaced by green bricks and your time to resolve the puzzle is limited.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX2", "release_date": "2002", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Teddy Warez", "publishers": "Teddy Warez", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/101345-guru-logic\n"}
