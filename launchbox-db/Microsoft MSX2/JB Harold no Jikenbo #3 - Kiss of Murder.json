{"altername_name": ["Kiss of Murder"], "name": "JB Harold no Jikenbo #3: Kiss of Murder", "overview": "Kiss of Murder is an adventure game set in a parallel world to Manhattan Requiem. While it features the same graphics and set of characters as that title, it has a completely different story. In Manhattan a large blue sapphire has been stolen and a young woman named Sarah Shields who worked at a jewelry store has been murdered. Insurance investigator Judd Gregory has contacted the private detective J.B. Harold and asked him for help with the case. Gameplay involves going to various locations in New York, talking to people, interrogating suspects, finding clues and gathering evidence. Early releases of the game (PC-88, X68000, FM-7, X1 and PC-98) are add-ons and require Manhattan Requiem to play. Later iterations became stand-alone.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX2", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Riverhill Soft", "publishers": "Riverhill Soft", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/139132-jb-harold-no-jikenbo-3-kiss-of-murder\n"}
