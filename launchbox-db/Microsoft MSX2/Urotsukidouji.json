{"altername_name": [], "name": "Urotsukidouji", "overview": "The game is based on the famous adult manga/anime series with the same name. It generally follows the main plot: the demon Amano Jaaku is banished from Makai (the demon world) to the Earth by the Elder, doomed to be trapped in a human body; he is given the mission of finding Choujin, the most powerful god, who is hiding in the body of a high-school student. Urotsukidouji is a Japanese-style adventure. The interaction with the game world is performed by choosing verb commands from the menu (\"Look\", \"Talk\", etc.). Navigation is also done by choosing the command \"Move\" and then the name of the location. Most of the time it is necessary to visit all the locations and deplete menu choices in order to advance the story.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX2", "release_date": "July 21, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "FairyTale", "publishers": "FairyTale", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/139107-urotsukidouji\n"}
