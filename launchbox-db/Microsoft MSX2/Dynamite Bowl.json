{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dynamite Bowl", "overview": "The general concept is that up to five players can play on any of the 30 bowling lanes available; simulating the concept of being in a bowling league. Players can change their lane positioning, determine how strong the throw is, and even make the ball go through various curves (or even through a straight ball into the pins). Each player character can be either male or female with options for bowling ball weights ranging from 7 pounds or 3.2 kilograms to 15 pounds or 6.8 kilograms.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX2", "release_date": "May 27, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Softvision", "publishers": "Toshiba-EMI", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "5", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamite_Bowl", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny9JqeoRKFc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27202-dynamite-bowl\n"}
