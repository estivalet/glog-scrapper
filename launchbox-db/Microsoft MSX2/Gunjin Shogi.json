Like Army Chess, Gunjin Shogi requires a third person to act as umpire and resolve combat. Unlike Army Chess (and more like Hai Lu Kong Jun Qi), Gunjin Shogi includes planes and tanks. Each player has 23 pieces, consisting of a flag, 12 officers, 2 planes, 2 tanks, a cavalry unit, two engineers, a spy and two land mines. There is a hierarchy of ranks, with some exceptions \u2013 planes naturally cannot be destroyed by land mines and engineers deactivate land mines, for instance\"", "platform": "Microsoft MSX2", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dual", "publishers": "Pack-In-Video", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/101329-gunjin-shogi\n"}
