{"altername_name": ["\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30ca\u30a4\u30c8II"], "name": "Dragon Knight 2", "overview": "Strawberry Fields - a magic country populated almost exclusively by beautiful young girls (that is, if we don't count the Wise Old Man and a couple of other male exceptions). All went well in this peaceful place, until the evil witch Mesaana abducted some of the country's lovely inhabitants and placed a curse upon them, turning them into hideous monsters. Enter Takeru Yamato (whom you might know as Desmond, the hero of Knights of Xentar), a young adventurer who happens to be in Strawberry Fields at that time. Takeru is told that in order to remove the curse one has to find three sacred writings, buried deep within three dangerous dungeons. Looks like a job for our adventurer - especially because the rescued girls will probably be very grateful! Dragon Knight II is the predecessor to Knights of Xentar, the only Dragon Knight game that was ever translated into English. This is a first-person game that is mainly dedicated to dungeon exploring. Takeru has to explore the three dungeons, fighting enemies and sometimes talking to dungeon inhabitants. The enemies are the girls who were turned into monsters by Mesaana. In town, Takeru can also buy weapons, armor, and items, and talk to various people.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX2", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Elf", "publishers": "elf", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.75", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Knight_II", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106350-dragon-knight-2\n"}
