{"altername_name": [], "name": "Kujaku Ou", "overview": "Kujaku Ou is based on the comic by the same name, published in Young Jump in the late eighties and drawn by Makoto Ogino. The story is centered around the demon-hunting Buddhist monk Kujaku, who gets send out by his master to investigate rumors about attacks on a nearby temple, which ultimately leads him on a quest to stop a demon clan from summoning their Dark Lord into the world. The game is a menu-based adventure game with verbs like \"go\", \"speak\", or \"look\" being the first menu choice, followed by objects/nouns in subsequent menus. From time to time Kujaku encounters enemies which he has to battle in a short combat sequences, which work similar to turn-based RPGs from that era (Dragon Quest). During combats, options are limited to fight, run away or use one of several prayers, which work as sort of magical spells. The game's story and gameplay resembles Sega's Kujaku Ou version for the Sega Master System, at least to its adventure part, because there are no action sequences in this version of the game.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX2", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Pony Canyon", "publishers": "Pony Canyon", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/139047-kujaku-ou\n"}
