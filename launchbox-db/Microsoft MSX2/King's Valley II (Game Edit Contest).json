{"altername_name": ["Ouke no Tani El Giza no Fuuin Edit Contest Yuushuu Sakuhinshuu"], "name": "King's Valley II (Game Edit Contest)", "overview": "King's Valley 2 is a puzzle game and a follow-up to King's Valley. Once again you need to collect all treasures by drilling and cutting your way through the pyramids. But beware of the mummies that haunt the pyramids. If you use the limited available cutting and drilling equipment in the wrong order you'll eventually get stuck and will have to play the whole level again. You will be given a password code after each completed pyramid. The game has a stage editor, so you can build and play your own puzzle stages. The contest was about making levels with the games' built-in level editor, held by four Japanese MSX magazines, two of them are MSX.FAN and Beep. The winners of this contest received a gold cartridge with the twenty custom stages on it. Custom levels can be saved to either a disk or tape, and the levels are interchangeable between both the MSX1 and MSX2 versions.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX2", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Valley_II", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzQNkq3LdIk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/159095-kings-valley-ii-game-edit-contest\n"}
