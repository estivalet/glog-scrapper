{"altername_name": ["\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30af\u30a4\u30ba"], "name": "Dragon Quiz", "overview": "Taking its name as pun on the Dragon Quest series, Dragon Quiz is a hybrid of a role-playing and a quiz game. Set in the very peaceful Quiz kingdom, the story revolves around a prince and his fair maid. One day, the Quiz king gives his son a pet dragon which the prince soon becomes very fond of. Unfortunately, his girlfriend is not equally fond of losing his attention, so she takes the dragon and leaves, intending to abandon it in a far-off place, so that it may never return and contend for her prince's love. Thus, the prince sets off to find his girlfriend and his pet dragon, somewhere in the Quiz kingdom. During his quest, the prince meets both friends and foes and lots of monsters. However, since this story is set in the Quiz kingdom, the battles are not fought using the usual RPG formula of weapons and magic spells. Instead, the monsters pose trivia questions which the player must answer. The prince loses hit points if a wrong answer is given. Getting the answer right awards the player with money, with which it is possible to buy equipment or lodge to regain health. Some adversaries won't let the prince pass unless he has made enough correct answers, which means that the player's quiz prowess is somewhat equivalent to experience points in normal RPGs. The questions range from linguistic matters (usually questions about Hiroshima dialect) and game trivia to technical matters or the Thunderbirds.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX2", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Compile", "publishers": "Compile", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106351-dragon-quiz\n"}
