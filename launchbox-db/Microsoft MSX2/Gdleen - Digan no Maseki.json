{"altername_name": ["Digan no Maseki: Gdleen"], "name": "Gdleen: Digan no Maseki", "overview": "Digan no Maseki incorporates Western RPG elements into the Japanese template. Along with the menu-driven turn-based battles and simple character growth system, the game also features a day/night cycle; the heroes can get tired and hungry, so buying rations for longer trips is essential. It is also possible to purchase horses for faster travel. Another feature more typical for Western RPGs are conversation topics and freedom of action. Certain NPCs can be attacked at will, even if their disposition is friendly. Others will offer as vast choice of topics to discuss, ranging from general information about the game's lore and more mundane problems. A \"show\" commands even allows to hear NPCs' opinions about items in the party's inventory.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX2", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Artec", "publishers": "Artec", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/119217-gdleen-digan-no-maseki\n"}
