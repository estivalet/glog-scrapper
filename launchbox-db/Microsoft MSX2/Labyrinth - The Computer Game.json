In the south cinema, the player chats with two teenagers about the actual movie at which point a hush descends upon the room and the in-game film begins...where the player learns that they have been chosen to be the thrall of Jareth the Goblin King, who must be overcome to finish the game. A clock ticks down 13 meager hours to complete this task, lest the player's character end up lost in the labyrinth forever.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX2", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Pack-In-Video", "publishers": "Pack-In-Video", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labyrinth:_The_Computer_Game", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFYKwC3g4tw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/65795-labyrinth-the-computer-game\n"}
