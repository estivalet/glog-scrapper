{"altername_name": ["Super Load Runner"], "name": "Super Lode Runner", "overview": "Between 1984 to 1986, Irem released four more different Lode Runner arcade games in Japan, following the original arcade games release. Stages were culled from these arcade games and were packaged into Super Lode Runner for the MSX. The game also kept the two-player mode from the arcade version. The game keeps the typical gameplay of the Lode Runner series. Players have to collect all the gold on the stage, while either avoiding or trapping the robotic guards who are constantly giving them chase. The game also features a level editor so players can create their own stages to play on. (This game shouldn't be confused with the NES game of the same title - it contains an entirely different set of stages to play.)", "platform": "Microsoft MSX2", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Irem", "publishers": "Irem", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lode_Runner", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeF-Szc7OQs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/74561-super-lode-runner\n"}
