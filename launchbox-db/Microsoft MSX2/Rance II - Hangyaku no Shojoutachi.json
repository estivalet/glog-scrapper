The town mayor has no choice but to invite Rance, a freelance private investigator whose mind is mostly occupied with pretty girls and promises to pay him quite a large sum of money if he stops the evil. Naturally, Rance agrees. It's time for him and his trusty cute purple-haired sidekick Shiiru to fight evil once again! Rance II: Hangyaku no Sh\u014djotachi is the second game in the anim\u00e9-style erotic role-playing game adventure series.
