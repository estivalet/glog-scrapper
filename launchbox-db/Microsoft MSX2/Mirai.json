{"altername_name": ["Future"], "name": "Mirai", "overview": "The year is 720 of the Galactic Era. Humans have ventured into deep space and found they were not alone in the universe. Alien life forms populated the galaxy, both friendly and hostile. The Rainbow Nebula is home to that last kind, and the protagonist of the game is the only one who can fight them. Mirai is a sci-fi shooter with strong role-playing elements. The player controls the protagonist who uses a jetpack to fly through scrolling maze-like environments. Experience points and money are gained from defeating the numerous respawning enemies. Money can be used in the few friendly areas to purchase weapons and items. The player also has to keep an eye on the fuel gauge for the protagonist's jetpack.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX2", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "XAIN Soft", "publishers": "XAIN Soft", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1sdVxYZk-vM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/74332-mirai\n"}
