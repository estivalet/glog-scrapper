{"altername_name": [], "name": "Warau Salesman", "overview": "Warau Salesman (The Laughing Salesman) is a Japanese-style adventure game based on the manga & anime of the same title by Fujiko Fujio A., a black humor series that plays off human weakness, carelessness, and stupidity for comic effect. The game features three unrelated episodes, each focusing on a different character, and each with multiple endings... though none of them could really be described as \"good\". The game proceeds mostly in standard adventure game style, with the only real interaction being dialogue choices or clicking on objects to investigate them, though there are a handful of minigames sprinkled throughout that will also affect the story outcome.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX2", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Compile", "publishers": "Compile", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/139108-warau-salesman\n"}
