{"altername_name": ["Pointless Fighting"], "name": "Street Fighter II", "overview": "In 2011, norakomi started working on a MSX2 version of Street Fighter 2. He successfully created a promising prototype in 2 months time. However for various reasons he never finished it and it was never shown to the public until last year's Barcelona RU. Footage and pictures found their way to the web and sparked the interest of many fans who tried convincing norakomi to resume the project. Some time later the decision was made that the game would be finished by another team. Now, with less than 6 months until the deadline, Baka-Yo! Softcorp has decided to make it official, announcing \"Pointless Fighting\" as the very first entry of #msxdev Compo 2014! They certainly have their work cut out for them. The game will no doubt be highly anticipated and looks set to raise the bar on MSX2 development. The current requirements for running this game are a MSX2 with 128kB RAM and a 4MB FlashROM, but in order to make the game accessible to more MSX users, these may be changed to 256kB RAM and MSX-DOS2. It will support keyboard and joysticks, including Joymega-adapter with Sega 6-button devices. MSX-MUSIC and MoonSound are also supported.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX2", "release_date": "December 31, 2014", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "", "developers": "Bart van Velzen (Norakomi)", "publishers": "Baka-Yo!
