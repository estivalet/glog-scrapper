{"altername_name": [], "name": "Undeadline", "overview": "A quality fantasy-themed vertical shooter with RPG elements, the game let's you choose among three distinct characters. The warrior is good at throwing axes and knives and can use his shield for protection from bullets. The wizard excels in the manipulation of elemental spirits and Ice and can perform an invisibility / invincibility spell to dodge bullets (but not enemies). While using the spell, he can't move though. Finally, the female-ninja is specialized in using Fire and the Boomerang and she has the ability to jump. The choice of the character is really important because each plays very differently and each should have a dedicated ending sequence.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX2", "release_date": "January 1, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "T&E Soft", "publishers": "T&E Soft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/33477-undeadline\n"}
