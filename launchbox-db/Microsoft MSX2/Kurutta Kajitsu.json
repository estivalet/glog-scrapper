The private tutor becomes a private detective... Kurutta Kajitsu is a rather standard Japanese-style adventure gameplay-wise. Typically for the genre, the player advances the story by repeatedly selecting verb commands (\"Examine\", \"Talk\", etc.) from a menu. Most of the time the player is free to move between various locations (also menu-wise) to explore the game world, talk to characters, and solve the mystery. The game has scenes with nudity and sexual content.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX2", "release_date": "June 1, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "FairyTale", "publishers": "FairyTale", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/156302-kurutta-kajitsu\n"}
