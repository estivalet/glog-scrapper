{"altername_name": ["Rune Worth: The Young Noble of a Wire-Puller", "Rune Worth: The Young Noble of a Wire-Puller"], "name": "Rune Worth: Kokui no Kikoushi", "overview": "This is the first game in a rather obscure trilogy of action RPGs by T&E Soft, who are best known for the Hydlide games -- but don't let that discourage you, because they were actually an extraordinarily prolific developer who made a lot of really great games back in the day, many of which were actually quite unique and almost experimental in nature. Rune Worth is one such game: at first glance, it looks a lot like Ys I & II, but it takes a very different approach. One of its most heavily advertised features at the time was its complete lack of experience points -- level-ups occurred by using certain items found in dungeons, rewarding you for exploration rather than grinding. Additionally, the game had a day/night mechanic that was used to rather good effect, and often offered the player multiple very different ways to progress the plot, providing opportunities for... well, actual role-playing!", "platform": "Microsoft MSX2", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "T&E Soft", "publishers": "T&E Soft", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0ZyzAi6seM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/102281-rune-worth-kokui-no-kikoushi\n"}
