{"altername_name": ["A Ressha de Ikou MSX"], "name": "A Ressha De Ikou", "overview": "A Ressha de Ikou is the first in the long-running transport network simulation series mostly known as A-Train. The player controls a railroad company CEO in the end of the nineteenth century, who was entrusted by the president of an unnamed country to build a railroad that reaches its Western coast. The game is played in real time, with a day/night cycle and a game world that changes regardless of the player's actions. Compared to its more widely known sequels, A Ressha de Ikou has a rather simple gameplay that is confined to building tracks for just one train line, the titular A-train. A report is generated that shows how well the player is doing in his/her competition against other networks.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX2", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "ArtDink", "publishers": "Pony Canyon", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/33519-a-ressha-de-ikou\n"}
