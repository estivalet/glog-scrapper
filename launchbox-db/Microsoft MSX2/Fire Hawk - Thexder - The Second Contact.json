The Fire Hawk robot had the same design as the Thexder: the main laser, shield, and ability to transform into a jet. It also had upgrades to allow it to launch guided missiles, and use special weapons found throughout the game. Obtaining special weapons caused a weapon carrier droid to be deployed, and if positioned correctly, would act as a shield against enemies. Graphics were improved from the original game, and game play was divided into sub-levels, with the fourth sub-level containing a \"boss\" enemy. It was also possible to restart later games at the beginning of a level previously visited.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX2", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Game Arts", "publishers": "Game Arts", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/91117-fire-hawk-thexder-the-second-contact\n"}
