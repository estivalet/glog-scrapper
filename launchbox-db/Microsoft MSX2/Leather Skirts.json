{"altername_name": [], "name": "Leather Skirts", "overview": "The game is played in a maze in which leather skirts must be collected. In the maze you will also find restaurants, bars and you can visit the red-light district. All in all, promising, but we were surprised when it turned out that overview of the maze image remains with also the locations where the above mentioned places can be found. We also had the game played out within half an hour because you simply have to follow the lines on the overview map. Reach one of the locations, you will get one nice picture to see. The graphics are smooth but the sound is almost completely missing as well as music. The subtitle \u2018For adults only\u2019 doesn't mean much either; the ladies are almost completely dressed.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX2", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Methodic Solutions", "publishers": "Methodic Solutions", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/118011-leather-skirts\n"}
