{"altername_name": ["Great Strategy II"], "name": "Daisenryaku II: Campaign Version", "overview": "Daisenryaku II: Campaign Version is a turn-based war strategy game that relies on the gameplay template introduced in Daisenryaku II: up to four players engage in battles against each other or computer AI, represented by differently colored armies (blue, red, green, and yellow); the belligerents produce units and vehicles and navigate them on a hex-based grid, trying to occupy the enemy's major cities and harbors. The game includes a main campaign with introduction and background information about the fictional countries involved in the conflict. In addition, at least a dozen playable maps are included, some representing real geographical areas. The MSX and PC Engine (TurboGrafx) CD versions feature enhanced graphics, full-screen battle sequences with backgrounds, and many additional maps.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX2", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "SystemSoft", "publishers": "Micro Cabin", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4spiv0wvko", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151856-daisenryaku-ii-campaign-version\n"}
