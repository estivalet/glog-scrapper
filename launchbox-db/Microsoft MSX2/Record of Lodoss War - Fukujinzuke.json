{"altername_name": ["Lodoss-Tou Senki: Fukujinzuke", "Record of Lodoss War Pack"], "name": "Record of Lodoss War: Fukujinzuke", "overview": "Fukujinzuke has little to do with the Japanese pickled vegetables it was named after. Rather, it is a small humorous mini-game tribute to Humming Bird's role-playing game Record of Lodoss War: Haiiro no Majo. Besides a sound gallery feature, the game consists of three mini-games. The first is a puzzle which requires the player to assemble a picture by sliding disarranged fragments of it one at a time. The second is a recreation of a typical battle from the role-playing game, featuring a party of high-level characters entering a castle and fighting enemies in a turn-based encounter identical to those of Haiiro no Majo. The third mini-game is a quiz concerning all things related to Record of Lodoss War.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX2", "release_date": "July 13, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Humming Bird Soft", "publishers": "Humming Bird Soft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/136761-record-of-lodoss-war-fukujinzuke\n"}
