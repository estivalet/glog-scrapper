As the game(s) progresses, the option to use an automatic camera is removed, forcing you to correctly guess both aperture, shutter speed, film sensitivity and if flash should be used.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX2", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "HARD", "publishers": "HARD", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/63066-bishoujo-shashinkan-special-the-double-vision\n"}
