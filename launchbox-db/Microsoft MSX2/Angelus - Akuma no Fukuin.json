An American female exchange student in Japan. Both were suddenly struck by a horrible disease that deformed their faces... Two young special agents, Alice and Brian, are sent to investigate the mystery, that will lead them into a dark world of occult and demonic forces... Akuma no Fukuin (Japanese for Devil's Gospel) is a Japanese-style adventure game. The player chooses menu commands (\"Look\", \"Talk\", etc.) that are displayed under a still picture that represents the location. Most of these command have their own context-dependent sub-menus, i.e. it is possible (and sometimes necessary) to look at different things and talk about different topics. There are no puzzles, and the story usually advances when the player has triggered a necessary conversation or event.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX2", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Enix", "publishers": "Enix", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/136768-angelus-akuma-no-fukuin\n"}
