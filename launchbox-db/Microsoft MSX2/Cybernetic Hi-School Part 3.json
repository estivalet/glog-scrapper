{"altername_name": ["Cybernetic Hi-School Part 3 - gunbusters"], "name": "Cybernetic Hi-School Part 3", "overview": "Just like the two previous Cybernetic Hi-School games, the third part is a strip quiz game. This time, it is centred upon Gainax's famous Gunbuster animation videos. You, as an alpha-class Top, are supposed to win three keys to pilot the Great Gunbuster robot against the cosmic threat to humanity. The keys are held by Jung-Freud, Kazumi (oneesama) and Noriko, and you must retrieve the keys by defeating each character in a quiz game, which has the side-effect of stripping them of all their clothes. Each character asks questions around a certain theme; Jung-Freud asks about the Soviet Union and military technology, Kazumi asks about fashion and Noriko asks about cult science fiction and animation.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX2", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Gainax", "publishers": "Gainax", "genres": "Quiz", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "0.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106371-cybernetic-hi-school-part-3\n"}
