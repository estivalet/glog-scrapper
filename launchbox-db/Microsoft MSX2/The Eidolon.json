{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Eidolon", "overview": "You control a mysterious 19th-century machine named \"The Eidolon\" through mysterious caves. Collect and create fireballs and encounter strange creatures like 'Greps', 'Biter Birds', 'Bottlenecks', 'Rotoflies', 'Puffer Birds' , and 'Guardian Dragons'. Each type of fireball you collect has different effects. For instance Blue fireballs freeze time, and green fireballs transform one monster into another type. A guardian dragon must be defeated at the end of each level. Eidolon is one of the progenitors of the first-person shooter genre, with full pseudo-3D panoramic graphics. This was achieved with the use of Lucasfilm Games 3D fractal technology, also used in Rescue on Fractalus! and Koronis Rift.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX2", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "P.A.W.", "publishers": "Pony Canyon", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eidolon", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7fMgYt-AD4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/63169-the-eidolon\n"}
