{"altername_name": ["Daisenryaku MSX2", "Great Strategy", "Daisenryaku Risk"], "name": "Daisenryaku", "overview": "Daisenryaku (\"Great Strategy\") is a military strategy game originally from SystemSoft that would spawn many dozens of sequels and spin-off series. The game is a serious strategy game in which the player takes turns to move their military units around a field - each representing a real-life military vehicle - and try to rout the enemy forces and take over their chief base of operations. Similarly to Nintendo's Famicom Wars, the key to victory is in taking over bases with which to generate more units per turn. With a larger number of units the player has a distinct advantage in overpowering the enemy forces. Likewise, each unit is stronger (or weaker) when facing other units of differing types. Players must know when to strike and when to wait patiently until a sufficient amount of back-up has arrived.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX2", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "SystemSoft", "publishers": "Micro Cabin", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggTZJxOULDM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/63065-daisenryaku\n"}
