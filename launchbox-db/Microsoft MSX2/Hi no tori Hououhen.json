As the game progresses, Gaou can power up by obtaining phoenix plumes to activate special weapons and other items to help him gain abilities such as invulnerability and special shots. In order to reach the final boss and pay a visit to the phoenix, Gaou must obtain a series of keys scattered across the stages - and must even backtrack to find others. The game is over when all three lives are gone - or when Gaou has reached the phoenix's lair.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX2", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.07", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hi_no_Tori_Hououhen_(MSX)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njs2rokFnIA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73976-hi-no-tori-hououhen\n"}
