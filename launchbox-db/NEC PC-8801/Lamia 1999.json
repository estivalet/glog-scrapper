{"altername_name": [], "name": "Lamia 1999", "overview": "UFO sightings and alleged contacts with aliens that were widespread in the second half of the 20th century eventually became a horrible reality. In the year 1999, aliens attacked Earth, and within a short time destroyed many of its cities and conquered the planet. A young man named Joe is wandering the ruins of Tokyo, trying to find his missing girlfriend Lamia. In the process he will find out about a human resistance movement and try to liberate Earth. Lamia 1999 is a role-playing game in which the player controls Joe, navigating him through complex, seamless side-scrolling locations of Tokyo. In the beginning of the game the player can distribute a few remaining points to raise Joe's attributes. Hostile aliens are roaming the city streets; a contact with them initiates a battle sequence, which takes place on a separate, confined screen. Combat is action-oriented and allows Joe to jump, dodging the aliens' ranged attacks. Experience points and money are awarded for defeating enemies. Joe also has an energy level and must carry food in order to survive.", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Hudson Soft", "publishers": "Hudson Soft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138574-lamia-1999\n"}
