The objective of the game is, after having fallen asleep, to explore a dream world inhabited by talking animals and to find an exit. Otherwise the character will never wake up again. Several items can be found and used in order to proceed. There are some room descriptions and the text commands are in very simple English. This has to be done in a \"verb + noun\" input.
