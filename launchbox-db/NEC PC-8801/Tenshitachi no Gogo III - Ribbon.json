{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tenshitachi no Gogo III: Ribbon", "overview": "The third game in the Tenshitachi no Gogo series is not connected to its predecessors story-wise. In this installment, the player assumes the role of a male teacher in a high school. Many pretty female students (and pretty female teachers) surround the hero, but he only has one girl in mind: Haru Okamoto, whom he calls \"his angel\". In order to win her love, the hero will have to know her better - which also means knowing the secrets of students and teachers alike... Tenshitachi no Gogo 3: Ribbon is a Japanese-style (puzzle-less) adventure game. The player interacts with the environment by choosing verb commands (\"Look\", \"Ask\", \"Search\", etc.), which lead to sub-menus with object choices. The game mostly advances in a linear way, but at certain points the story can end prematurely, depending on the player's choice.", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "JAST", "publishers": "Jast", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138692-tenshitachi-no-gogo-iii-ribbon\n"}
