{"altername_name": ["Donkey Kong 3: The Great Counterattack"], "name": "Donkey Kong 3: Dai Gyakushuu", "overview": "In 1984, Hudson Soft developed a semi-sequel of Donkey Kong 3 for the Japanese-only NEC PC-8801, NEC PC-6601, and Sharp X1 personal computers titled Donkey Kong 3: Dai Gyakushuu. A version for the FM-7 was also planned, but was never released. This game is significantly different from the original. While the object to shoot Donkey Kong up in the air remains, it has 20 outdoor backgrounds such as a bridge, Planet Saturn, a desert, a pyramid, and a highway. Stanley can only move from left to right and is no longer able to jump.", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hudson Soft", "publishers": "Hudson Soft", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey_Kong_3#Semi-sequel", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/DKRVcTJ-EyA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151952-donkey-kong-3-dai-gyakushuu\n"}
