{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Death Trap", "overview": "During the 1980-ies, the relationship between the free world and the socialist block became increasingly tense and hostile. Many countries began to prepare for a global-scale war, working on new weapons. One of such countries is the mysterious \"B country\" in Eastern Africa. Eager to seize power with biological weapons, an organization associated with this country kidnaps the famous scientist Dr. Gitanes. An agent named Benson is sent to B country in order to rescue the doctor and avert the new threat to world peace. The Death Trap is notable for being the very first game created by the renowned developer Square. It is an adventure game with a rather basic text input (Japanese only) and graphics that represent locations, people, and objects. Finding the right way and collecting various items are essential to advance the game's narrative.", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Square", "publishers": "Square", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/131021-the-death-trap\n"}
