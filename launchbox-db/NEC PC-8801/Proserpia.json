{"altername_name": [], "name": "Proserpia", "overview": "God and humans were still living together. The Greek village of Sachiria was suffering from a drought. It has been raining for months. The villagers decide to offer a sacrifice to calm the wrath of God. When Erine's twin sister was chosen, she embarks on a journey to solve the mystery of the drought to save her sister. The game mixes Japanese-style adventure and RPG -elements, though the latter is implemented in a way that is rarely seen in computer games. When the player chooses an action, the success or failure is randomized; for example when you go to a battle, it will progress automatically until the victory or defeat is decided ie in some cases you may die.", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Amorphous", "publishers": "TAKERU", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/140119-proserpia\n"}
