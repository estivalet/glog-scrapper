{"altername_name": [], "name": "Kawanakajima no Kassen", "overview": "Kawanakajima no Kassen is a war simulation title based on the Battle of Kawanakajima. This was the first video game sold by Koei founder Kou Shibusawa. As the Takeda, players are tasked with defeating the Uesugi by leading a formation of units to battle. Units are color-coded to designate their respective classes. Movement is done by inputting the appropriate direction and distance. When moving from one area to another, the map's coordinates will change to reflect the player's current position. Mobilizing troops is essential in order to locate and defeat enemy units; this mechanic is used to simulate a sense of uncertainty inspired by Shingen's struggles with overcoming his rival during their fourth battle at Kawanakajima.", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "October 26, 1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Koei", "publishers": "Koei", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/157639-kawanakajima-no-kassen\n"}
