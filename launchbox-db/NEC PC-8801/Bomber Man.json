{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bomber Man", "overview": "Bomber Man is a video game developed by Hudson Soft. It was the first Bomberman game to be created. The player controls Bomber Man with the arrow keys. Bomber Man moves half of a tile space with every step. The map is comprised of a grid of hard blocks with soft blocks scattered throughout. Bombs can be placed with the Space key. The goal of the game is to destroy all the enemies with explosions to progress to the next stage. The game is ostensibly endless. In each stage, a bonus item is contained within a random soft block. Collecting the bonus item will increase the game score. Bonuses include a Coke can, cocktail, penny-farthing bicycle, sack of gold, treasure chest, and other various affects. Another soft block in each stage contains an exit. Touching the exit will restart the current stage. If either an exit or a bonus is hit with an explosion, it will be destroyed and will release four more enemy characters, which also must be defeated to progress. The player begins with three lives; extra lives cannot be gained through gameplay.", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hudson Soft", "publishers": "Hudson Soft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomberman_(1983_video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/157896-bomber-man\n"}
