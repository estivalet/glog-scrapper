{"altername_name": [], "name": "Burning Point", "overview": "A young private detective named Mike Steel has opened a new office in Santa Chris, California. One day, a distinguished-looking elderly couple arranges an interview with him. It appears that their granddaughter is presumed dead, but the body has never been found. The couple hires Mike to search for the missing body; but as the detective begins to investigate the matter, he realizes that there is a much bigger conspiracy behind that. Burning Point is a mystery-themed adventure game. The game does not have the usual set of simple verb commands with object lists, which is common for Japanese adventures. Instead, it offers specific options at each screen (though most of them repeat themselves as Mike goes about his investigation). The player has to interview suspects, unlock new locations (which, in their turn, deliver new suspects), as well as gather and examine evidence in order to advance the story and solve the case.", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "February 1, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Enix", "publishers": "Enix", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/127853-burning-point\n"}
