{"altername_name": [], "name": "Alice", "overview": "Alice: Adventures in Wonderland is a rather frivolous adaptation of Lewis Carroll's classic tale. It is a text adventure with graphics; the player can interact with the environment by typing combinations of verbs and objects (e.g. \"open door\"). Some basic commands are bound to the function keys. Content-wise, the game features a few familiar characters and situations from the book, but many of them are completely new and involve not only story segments (such as a fight with a dragon) but also explicit erotic images such as naked pixies etc.", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "PSK", "publishers": "PSK", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137780-alice\n"}
