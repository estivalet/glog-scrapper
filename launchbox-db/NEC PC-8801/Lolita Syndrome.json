Lolita Syndrome was the winning game of the second Hobby Program Contest sponsored by Enix. Lolita Syndrome consists of four \"rooms\" (scenes), each shaped like a mini-game and each presenting a different young girl in a dangerous situation. These mini-games require little skill and are mostly based on guessing. For example, in one scene the player has to select numbered knives which are then thrown at the girl, hoping not to choose the two knives that will actually hurt her and end the game. Other mini-games involve selecting random keys to stop a torture device from killing the girl, inputting a few text commands to cure a sick girl, and participate in a rock-paper-scissors game. The fifth room contains no game and only consists of pictures. A successful completion of each stage leads images of naked girls.", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Enix Corporation", "genres": "Horror", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.95", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lolita_Syndrome", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90886-lolita-syndrome\n"}
