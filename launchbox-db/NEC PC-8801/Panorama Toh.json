{"altername_name": ["Panorama Tou"], "name": "Panorama Toh", "overview": "In Panorama Toh the player assumes the role of an adventurer who is entrusted with the task of traveling to a beautiful island and liberating it from monsters. The game is closest to the role-playing format, albeit with several distinguishing features. The player character has hit points and stamina statistics, can equip weapons and armor, find or win gold in battles and purchase items. The top-down overworld is comparatively small, but has to be navigated with care: there are various kinds of enemies and traps to be found there. Whenever something of interest occurs a very small separate window is displayed in the corner of the screen, showing for example the positioning of the enemies or the nature of the trap. The player interacts with the environment by pressing keys corresponding to commands; it is often necessary to outsmart enemies or even jump in certain instances. Dungeons are done is first-person pseudo-3D. The game flows in real time and the protagonist will eventually die of hunger and fatigue if the player is not careful enough.", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nihon Falcom", "publishers": "Nihon Falcom", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/v4t6A9C31h0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/136812-panorama-toh\n"}
