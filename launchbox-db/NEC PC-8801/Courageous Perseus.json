{"altername_name": [], "name": "Courageous Perseus", "overview": "An island has been over-run by a gorgon and her minions. The three goddesses there have been captured, the twelve signs of the zodiac dispersed, and the creatures enslaved. Perseus has been summoned by Zeus to right this wrong, and has been given a magic sword and shield with which to do it... Courageous Perseus is an action RPG, where the aim is to fight monsters and find either the 12 zodiac symbols or the three missing goddesses. Perseus starts the game on a raft off the coast of the island, which is crawling with monsters which randomly move about. These can be fought by running into them while holding down the fight button. Due to inexperience, only the light blue soldiers may be killed at the start of the game. But each won battle improves Perseus's offensive and defensive statistics, allowing Centaurs, Cockatrices, a Dragon and the gorgon herself to be eventually overcome. Winning a battle also restores a small amount of Perseus's energy. Energy is decreased though by being hit by enemies and also slowly decreases with time. Perseus starts with 1000 energy, which can be supplemented by finding energy sources scattered around the island. Once the energy reaches zero, the game is over. The game can also be lost if Perseus's raft is capsized by one of the giant crabs that infest the surrounding seas. Winning the game will require killing most of the creatures on the island, since monsters re-spawn very slowly", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Cosmos Computer", "publishers": "Cosmos Computer", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138395-courageous-perseus\n"}
