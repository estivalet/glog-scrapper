{"altername_name": [], "name": "Demons Ring", "overview": "Demons Ring is an \"Occult Fantasy Adventure\" game released in March 12, 1984 for the NEC PC-88 and was an early title developed by Nihon Falcom. The game involves the player solving puzzle by interacting with environments through the use of a text parser and was an example of Falcom's technical know-how at the time. Every contemporary Japanese adventure game released for computers during this period would draw its graphics line-by-line and slowly fill in the colors, a long process that would need to be done anytime the scene changed to a new image. Demons Ring, on the other hand, could transition to different images in under half a second, a feature that was heavily advertised by Falcom and something that would eventually become a standard for the genre moving forward.", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "March 12, 1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nihon Falcom", "publishers": "Nihon Falcom", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/GigHKgKWpyI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/140716-demons-ring\n"}
