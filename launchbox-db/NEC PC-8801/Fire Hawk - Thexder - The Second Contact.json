{"altername_name": [], "name": "Fire Hawk: Thexder: The Second Contact", "overview": "Fire Hawk: Thexder - The Second Contact was released in 1989. It retained the same concept as the original Thexder but added many improvements. The Fire Hawk robot had the same design as the Thexder: the main laser, shield, and ability to transform into a jet. It also had upgrades to allow it to launch guided missiles, and use special weapons found throughout the game. Obtaining special weapons caused a weapon carrier droid to be deployed, and if positioned correctly, would act as a shield against enemies. Graphics were improved from the original game, and game play was divided into sub-levels, with the fourth sub-level containing a \"boss\" enemy. It was also possible to restart later games at the beginning of a level previously visited.", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Game Arts", "publishers": "Game Arts", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/89244-fire-hawk-thexder-the-second-contact\n"}
