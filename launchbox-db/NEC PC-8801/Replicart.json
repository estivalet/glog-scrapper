To repel the attack, Earth's scientists construct the Replicart machine, a deadly robot snake. The player takes the role of the pilot of the Replicart.

Once you fulfill your quota you can enter the next stage through an exit that opens on the left side of the screen. Collecting biteslime increases the length of your snake. If the head of your snake hits a wall, an enemy or part of its body you lose a life.
