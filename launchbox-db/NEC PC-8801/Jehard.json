{"altername_name": [], "name": "Jehard", "overview": "Jehard is a simple action role-playing game. The Holy Ark was stolen by a powerful demon king, and it's up to the lone hero to retrieve it. The game world mostly consists of overhead maze-like hostile areas. The player navigates the protagonist and fights enemies by \"bumping\" into them, similarly to Ys. Experience points are awarded for vanquishing enemies. Basic equipment and special items can be found throughout the course of the game.", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Xtalsoft", "publishers": "XTALSOFT", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138523-jehard\n"}
