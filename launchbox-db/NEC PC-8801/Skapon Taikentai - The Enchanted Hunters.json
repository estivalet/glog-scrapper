{"altername_name": [], "name": "Skapon Taikentai: The Enchanted Hunters", "overview": "The year is 2028. It is said that an eccentric genius scientist has constructed a laboratory on an island known as Ero-Manga. This island is populated by robots and beautiful girls. An exploration team consisting of an intrepid adventurer and his female assistant, who is looking for her missing father, lands on the island and is prepared to explore the wilderness in search of the laboratory. Skapon Taikentai is a humorous erotic adventure game. The player moves from locations represented as still anime-style screens with the arrow keys. Eight verb commands (such as \"Examine\", \"Take\", \"Talk\", etc.) are available at all times in a menu to the right. In the wilderness areas there is a considerable degree of exploration, as the player is free to visit any locations from the onset. There are no real puzzles, but sometimes certain items have to be acquired and used in appropriate locations in order to advance.", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "PSK", "publishers": "PSK", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138670-skapon-taikentai-the-enchanted-hunters\n"}
