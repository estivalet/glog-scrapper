{"altername_name": [], "name": "Daidassou", "overview": "You have to infiltrate a hostile fortress and free five POWs. First you have to kill an enemy soldier and get the key to open the prison doors and then you have to go to each prison door to open it and bring the POWs outside. To kill the enemy soldiers you have a gun and grenades you can throw. Be careful, as the enemy soldiers will try to kill you and take away any POW you lead. If an enemy captures a POW he will bring the POW to a pink prison door, which can only be opened with a grenade blast.", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Carry Lab", "publishers": "Carry Lab", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/ytITKMnJ_Rc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/140006-daidassou\n"}
