{"altername_name": [], "name": "Asteka", "overview": "Asteka might be a misspelling of Azteca, but it deals with the legacy of the Maya culture rather than the Aztecs. The player takes control of a nameless adventurer who travels to the town of Palenque in South Mexico. There, he has to visit various locations and talk to the local inhabitants in order to gain entrance to the ruins of an ancient Mayan temple, which supposedly harbors the deepest secrets of their civilization. The game is a text adventure with graphics. The player switches between locations by typing words for \"North\", \"South\", etc., or simply by using the numeric arrow keys. The interaction with the environment is performed entirely by typing verb-object (or, rather, as the rules of Japanese grammar dictate, object-verb) command combinations. Text input and output are both in katakana only.", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nihon Falcom", "publishers": "Nihon Falcom", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/VOaAKdf0nvI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/136797-asteka\n"}
