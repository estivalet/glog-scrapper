{"altername_name": [], "name": "Las Vegas", "overview": "Las Vegas is a Japan-exclusive graphical variant of Softporn Adventure, and hence can be seen as an earlier version of Leisure Suit Larry, which was released a few months later. The gameplay is, by and large, identical to the original text-only version, with the exception of a few adjustments made to the monetary system and a few commands handled slightly differently. Like before, the player types text commands consisting of combinations of verbs and objects. The game recognizes both Japanese and English inputs. The major difference is the inclusion of graphics. Each location is represented by an anime-style image. With the exception of flashing lights and alike, there is no animation, though a few actions lead to separate zoomed-in scenes appearing on top of the main image. The game's visuals are sexually more explicit than Leisure Suit Larry. For example, the hooker is partially nude, and there are also visible obscene drawings on the bathroom walls.", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "StarCraft", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138576-las-vegas\n"}
