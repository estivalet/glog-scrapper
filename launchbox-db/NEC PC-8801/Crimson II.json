{"altername_name": [], "name": "Crimson II", "overview": "Years have passed since the evil Crimson was defeated. Peace was restored, and humanity enjoyed an era of prosperity. But a new demonic being has arisen, ending the peace in the world. Five heroes must find each other and unite in order to vanquish him. The sequel to Crimson retains the basic gameplay of its predecessor and is a medieval-themed role-playing game with overhead exploration and first-person turn-based combat against randomly appearing enemies. The first part of the game is broken into chapters, each dedicated to one of the five heroes; afterwards, they are united as a party and continue the quest together, similarly to Dragon Quest IV.", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Xtalsoft", "publishers": "XTALSOFT", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138397-crimson-ii\n"}
