{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hole in One", "overview": "HAL's Hole in One is a standard 18-hole golf game, played from a top-down perspective. You can compete in stroke play with up to four players, or match play against a friend or the computer. When playing against the computer, you will play against an opponent that uses metal clubs, which hit farther than the standard wooden clubs. In addition to stroke and match play, you can obtain passwords that allow you to replay any spectacular shots that you make (eagles, holes-in-one, and double-eagles).", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "HAL Laboratory", "publishers": "HAL Laboratory", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138508-hole-in-one\n"}
