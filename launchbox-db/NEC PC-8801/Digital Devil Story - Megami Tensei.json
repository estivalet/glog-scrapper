{"altername_name": ["Digital Devil Monogatari: Megami Tensei"], "name": "Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei", "overview": "Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei is a game for the MSX series of computers, later ported to similar machines. Developed by Telenet, it is also the very first game in the entire Megami Tensei franchise; however, though it is based on the same source, it has no other ties to the later games developed by Atlus. The PC-88 version is essentially a remake of the original simpler MSX game. Gameplay is mostly based on the arcade game Gauntlet.", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "August 1, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Telenet Japan", "publishers": "Telenet", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCwf2M89nrE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/89241-digital-devil-story-megami-tensei\n"}
