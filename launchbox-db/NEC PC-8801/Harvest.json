{"altername_name": [], "name": "Harvest", "overview": "The player's goal in Harvest is to collect all apples on single screen level layout with his cat-resembling character, while being chased by multiple enemies. The gameplay can be compared to Lode Runner to some extent. While the player can't dig holes to trap enemies, they can be jumped over. A fall from heights will result in the loss of a life, as does the running out of a time limit. Once all apples have been collected, the player advances to the next level with a different layout and enemies.", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Micronet", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/157911-harvest\n"}
