{"altername_name": [], "name": "A Ressha de Ikou", "overview": "A Ressha de Ikou is the first in the long-running transport network simulation series mostly known as A-Train. The player controls a railroad company CEO in the end of the nineteenth century, who was entrusted by the president of an unnamed country to build a railroad that reaches its Western coast. The game is played in real time, with a day/night cycle and a game world that changes regardless of the player's actions. Compared to its more widely known sequels, A Ressha de Ikou has a rather simple gameplay that is confined to building tracks for just one train line, the titular A-train. A report is generated that shows how well the player is doing in his/her competition against other networks.", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "ArtDink", "publishers": "ArtDink", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-Train", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/AJGyX7Ym-gA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147099-a-ressha-de-ikou\n"}
