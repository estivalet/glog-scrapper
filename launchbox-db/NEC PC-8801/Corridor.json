The king could not choose one son over the other, so he was troubled when he was asked to pass on the throne to one of them. He thought about it for several days before he gave them a challenge. Each prince should begin a three year journey. Whoever finishes his quest with the most heroism will win the crown. Siegfried, the player's character, is the youngest of these three princes.
