{"altername_name": [], "name": "Lizard", "overview": "Lizard is a simple first-person dungeon crawler in Wizardry style, though with a single player character rather than a party. The goal is to explore a maze-like pseudo-3D tower and locate a magical book that would help the hero to rescue a captured princess. The player can choose between the classes of Fighter, Thief, and Merchant when creating the protagonist. Town menu is wholly text-based. Battles are random and allow the player to either attack or use items.", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Xtalsoft", "publishers": "Riverhill Soft", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138584-lizard\n"}
