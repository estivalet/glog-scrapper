{"altername_name": ["Chatty"], "name": "Ch\u00e1tty", "overview": "Ch\u00e1tty is the second entry in System Sacom's Novel Ware series. Its story is set in the future and involves a man who was framed for a crime he did not commit. In attempt to clear his name, the protagonist discovers a device that allows interdimensional travel, and ventures into a parallel dimension in search for answers. Unlike the previous Novel Ware game, Ch\u00e1tty is a more traditional Japanese-style adventure, with fewer and shorter conversations and text descriptions. Interaction with the environment and navigation are performed by selecting verb commands and combining them with objects from a menu list. There are no real puzzles, but it is possible to pick up objects, use them, and examine them in an inventory.", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "System Sacom", "publishers": "System Sacom", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138388-chatty\n"}
