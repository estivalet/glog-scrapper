{"altername_name": [], "name": "Girls Paradise: Rakuen no Tenshitachi", "overview": "The protagonist of the game is an eighteen-year-old boy whose destiny is to defeat a legendary demon, thus ending the Age of Darkness. As the hero embarks on his journey, he realizes that he must have chosen a wrong destination, for he becomes stranded on a tropical island that seems to be populated entirely by women. No, the hero does not abandon his world-saving mission because of that; but in order to leave the island, he needs to perform various quests for its young and pretty female inhabitants, which more often than not involve demonstrating... err... somewhat intimate aspects of his heroic nature. Girls Paradise is an adventure game without real puzzles and with menu-based interface; however, it differs from most typical Japanese adventures by allowing (and requiring) the player to find and pick up certain items and then use them from the inventory to advance in the game. The story progression relies more on direct dialogue and usage of items than on \"triggering\" events by repeatedly selecting commands. It is possible to look and otherwise interact with objects by moving the arrow keys and highlighting the object on screen. The interaction is still quite limited, though; not every screen has interactive objects, and most of the time the hero is allowed to move between locations only when dictated by the story.", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "July 28, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Great", "publishers": "Great", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138487-girls-paradise-rakuen-no-tenshitachi\n"}
