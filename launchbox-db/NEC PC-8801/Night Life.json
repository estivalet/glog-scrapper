{"altername_name": [], "name": "Night Life", "overview": "The first commercial Japanese erotic game, Night Life is a simple simulation of sexual intercourse, marketed as a tool aiming to help couples enjoy their sexual life more. Player interaction is restricted to a few choices. The player is given the option to make a schedule to determine the date of the woman's period. By answering a few questions, the player can choose a set of sexual positions he is willing to use for the virtual intercourse (these positions are also available as a \"demo\", accessed from the game's main menu). Afterwards, the player chooses the amount of time for each position. The subsequent display of the intercourse is non-interactive and consists of a small picture of the chosen position in the middle of a screen, accompanied by a timer.", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Koei", "publishers": "Koei", "genres": "Life Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_Life_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138616-night-life\n"}
