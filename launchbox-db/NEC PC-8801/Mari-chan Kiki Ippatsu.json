{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mari-chan Kiki Ippatsu", "overview": "Mari-chan Kiki Ippatsu consists of a series of stages depicting repeated assassination attempts on a young girl named Mariko Hashimoto. Each stage is dedicated to a different kind of murder. In the initial level the killers try to stab the girl to death. In each subsequent stage she is being kidnapped and tied up, and the killers try to assassinate her by blowing her up, drowning her in a water tank, etc. The player's goal is always to rescue her. Regardless of the stage, this is achieved by playing a real-time rock-paper-scissors game. The player has three function keys at his disposal and must press the right key at the right time, trying to beat the opponent. Mariko removes an item of her clothing after each successfully completed stage. Beating the game yields an erotic nude picture of the girl.", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Enix Corporation", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/131084-mari-chan-kiki-ippatsu\n"}
