{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Dark Crystal", "overview": "The Dark Crystal is closely based on Jim Henson's film of the same name. The game is set in Thra, a world with three suns, which come together every thousand years in an event known as \"The Great Conjunction\". The player controls Jen, the last survivor of the Gelfings, a race of mole-like people. He must find a dark crystal and its broken shard, and repair it to end the reign of a tyrannical lord. Like other installments of the Hi-Res Adventures series, the game is entirely text-based, with non-animated graphics to illustrate the areas. Movement between areas and interaction with the game world is performed by typing commands consisting of either one or two words (a combination of a verb and an object).", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "StarCraft", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/140009-the-dark-crystal\n"}
