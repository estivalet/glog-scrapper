{"altername_name": [], "name": "Testament", "overview": "The continent of Diodoran is ruled by five dragons residing in the Dark Sky. One day, a horde of monsters invaded the continent and as a result the city of Rastram sunk below the surface of the sea. One intrepid adventurer who actually believed that myth ventured into the ruins, determined to find out what exactly happened, but was met with fierce opposition from the monstrous dwellers. Testament is a top-down shooter. The player navigates the protagonist through fairly complex, maze-like stages, shooting at constantly appearing monsters. Shields and grenades can be found along the way, as well as food (such as hamburgers) that restores the hero's health. A map for each stage can be acquired in a certain location within, facilitating the task of finding the exit.", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Glodia", "publishers": "Basho House", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "0.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138693-testament\n"}
