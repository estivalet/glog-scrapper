{"altername_name": [], "name": "Still Sword", "overview": "Three dragons suddenly appeared in the magical world of Forfaral. Five princesses of five countries constituting the realm, entrusted with the protection of the sacred light, were abducted. The hero, chosen by the magicians as the carrier of the legendary Still Sword, must venture into each country, now overrun by vicious monsters, rescue the princesses and defeat the fiends. Still Sword is an overhead action dungeon crawler. The player character explores maze-like environments populated by wandering enemies. Defeating them yields experience points, gold, as well as random items such as weapons, equipment, or healing potions. Special rooms contain plot-related boss enemies that must be vanquished in order to move on to the next segment. After release the fans of FairyTale games were confused that the game was not Adult themed like their other games, so later in the same year the game \"Still Sword for Adult\" was released, which changed the protagonist and antagonist into females and contained the requested Adult content.", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "April 1, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "FairyTale", "publishers": "FairyTale", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/155608-still-sword\n"}
