{"altername_name": ["ChoroQ Holidays Puzzle"], "name": "Choro Q Holiday Puzzle", "overview": "Choro Q Holiday Puzzle is a simple sliding tile puzzle game based on Takara's popular line of miniature toy cars. It features only a single picture to unscramble, but offers four different difficulty settings (which change the size of the pieces), as well as one crucial difference with most other puzzles of this type: each of the three light colors in the puzzle is scrambled and must be solved separately, and the player can freely switch between moving the red, green, and blue pieces around the board.", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kogado Studio", "publishers": "Takara", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138390-choro-q-holiday-puzzle\n"}
