{"altername_name": [], "name": "Swashbuckler", "overview": "Swashbuckler is an early fighting game. The whole game takes place on the same screen. You're in the center and enemies such as humans, snakes, and rats come at you from either side. You've got a sword that can strike high, low or center, or block. As the game progresses the number and speed of the enemies increase until they're too fast for a human to handle. This was pretty similar to another Datamost title, \"Aztec\" which was an Indiana Jones type side-scroller.", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Datamost, Inc.", "publishers": "Comptiq", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swashbuckler_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138686-swashbuckler\n"}
