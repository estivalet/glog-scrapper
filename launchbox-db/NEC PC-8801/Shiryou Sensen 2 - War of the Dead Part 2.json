{"altername_name": ["\u6b7b\u970a\u6226\u7dda War of the Dead Part 2"], "name": "Shiryou Sensen 2: War of the Dead Part 2", "overview": "Shiry\u014d Sensen 2 - War of the Dead Part 2 is a sequel to Shiry\u014d Sensen - War of the Dead. Gameplay-wise, it is quite different from its predecessor. RPG elements such as a \"world map\", random encounters, heavy weapon and item management, etc. have been completely removed. The game is played entirely from top-down perspective, taking place in various districts of the large city. The gameplay can be described as a mixture of adventure and action elements. Laila has to explore the city, talk to characters, and sometimes procure items necessary to unlock a new location and advance the story. Combat is rather sparse, and is restricted to one enemy at a time. Battle mechanics are much simpler than in the first game, with Laila having only one gun, unlimited ammunition, and no jumping or ducking abilities.", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Fun Project", "publishers": "Victor Musical Industries", "genres": "Horror", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90889-shiryou-sensen-2-war-of-the-dead-part-2\n"}
