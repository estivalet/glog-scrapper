{"altername_name": [], "name": "Funhouse Mystery", "overview": "Funhouse Mystery is a text-adventure game originally written and coded by Scott Adams and published by Adventure International in 1979. The NEC PC-88 version was released in 1985 by StarCraft for the Japanese audiences, though the game still supports English commands. You are a secret agent tasked to retrieve some secret plans that have been stolen and hidden somewhere inside a fun house. Once inside it, you have to solve several puzzles, such as navigate through a maze, a shooting gallery, a merry-go-round, and charm a friendly mermaid. Main differences from the original western releases are: -The game parser won't recognize some commands that work on the original version; - Graphics; - Some objects such as the flashlight and the secret plans are different but they serve the same purpose. - The map layout is somewhat different.", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Starcraft", "publishers": "StarCraft", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/oU25YIewpd4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/140718-funhouse-mystery\n"}
