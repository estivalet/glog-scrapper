Hotels and pawn shops can no longer admit the player for the remainder of the game after a theft has taken place. The player can equip one hand with a weapon, and the other with a passive tool, such as a lamp for dark areas. The player can buy gear, sleep at hotels, gamble, steal, and bribe non-player characters. The player needs to eat to prevent hunger, with recharging health based on food level. It features an in-game clock, with day/night cycles and four seasons; the color changes to reflect the time of day and the season.", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "dB-SOFT", "publishers": "dB-Soft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Poco", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/xWZlJ2Db4eI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/140155-woody-poco\n"}
