{"altername_name": [], "name": "Arcus II: Silent Symphony", "overview": "Ten years have passed since the knight Jedah Chaf and his companions gained an audience with the Golden Dragon and made the choice that determined the destiny of the Arcusas land. The half-elf Picto was one of the five heroes who accompanied Jedah. A new adventure lies in front of him. Rumors of the legendary Rune Blade draw him out on a new quest, but his true mission will be to find his legendary companions and to rid Arcusas of a new terrible evil. Visually, Arcus II is more similar to a traditional Japanese RPG than its predecessor. The navigation is done in top-down perspective in all the locations. The turn-based battles are still viewed from first person perspective. The enemies are visible on screen and the battle initiates once the player into contact with one of them. Despite its typical RPG structure and gameplay focus (party management, turn-based battles, large world to explore, etc.), Arcus II lacks several basic RPG features. The party receives only gold and no experience points from battles. There are no weapons and/or armor that the characters are able to equip; money can only be spent on healing items. Enemies can be therefore avoided altogether, and the game's challenge lies in the boss battles.", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Wolf Team", "publishers": "Wolf Team", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/131015-arcus-ii-silent-symphony\n"}
