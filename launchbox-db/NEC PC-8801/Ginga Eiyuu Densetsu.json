{"altername_name": ["Legend of Galactic Heroes"], "name": "Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu", "overview": "This is the first in Bothtec's series of games based on the anime adaptation of Yoshiki Tanaka's science fiction novel cycle Legend of the Galactic Heroes. The games are set in the fictional future as depicted in the novels: humanity has spread all over the Milky Way, and split into two powerful states which are having a permanent war with each other: the Galactic Empire, and the Free Planets Alliance. Two genius strategists are leading the forces of their respective states: Reinhard von M\u00fcsel for the Empire, and Yang Wenli for the Alliance. The game is dedicated entirely to large-scale strategic battles and is not particularly story-driven. There are five different scenarios to choose from, which put the player in control of either Imperial or Alliance forces and revolve around \"historical\" battles based on the novels' lore, with exact dates and victory conditions.", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "March 1, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Microvision", "publishers": "Bothtec", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/127708-ginga-eiyuu-densetsu\n"}
