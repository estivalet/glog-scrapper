{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dezeni World", "overview": "Dezeni World is a sequel to Dezeni Land. Like its predecessor, it is set in a theme park, this time with a broader range of parodies. Featuring a warning \"For Crazy People Only\" on the cover, the game casts the player into the role of one Dezeni-Man, a rather unremarkably-looking character who nevertheless must defeat the nefarious supercomputer HAL3. On his way he encounters various eccentric people, including popular comic book characters such as Superman, a robot bearing a strong resemblance to C-3PO from Star Wars, etc. Gameplay-wise, it is very similar to the previous title. The player moves from screen to screen with key abbreviations representing the four directions, and interacts with the environment by typing combinations of verbs and nouns. The game is fairly simple and develops in a comparatively linear fashion, with only a few items needed to access the next area, and puzzles mostly involving talking to people or using the right item at the right place.", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hudson Soft", "publishers": "Hudson Soft", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138407-dezeni-world\n"}
