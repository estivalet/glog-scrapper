{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cannon Ball", "overview": "You are the Cannon Man and you have to shoot the bouncing ball. When you hit the ball it will fall apart in two or three smaller balls and If you hit those smaller balls, they will also fall apart into two or three smaller balls. And if you hit the smallest balls again they will disappear. The gameplay is straightforward, you can only move from left to right and can shoot straight up. Don't get hit by the bouncing balls!", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Hudson Soft", "publishers": "Hudson Soft Company", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/iI8f6JA-9FA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/139984-cannon-ball\n"}
