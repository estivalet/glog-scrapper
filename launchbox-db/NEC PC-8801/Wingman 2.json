The clues are to be found in the eight locations of the school. Wingman 2 is an Adventure game, developed and published by Enix Corporation, which was released in Japan in 1986 The aim of the game is to find the killers sent from Podrimus dimension and neutralize them. The clues are to be found in the eight locations of the school. Original story. This time it's more fun since we're accompanied by Aoi or Miki who do all the feedback. It's a pretty cool system that it's enough to write the proper verb and just click on the object - that's almost point-and-click here! There are three chapters with first two moving between the same eight places and the third final one without any moving. In the prequel the fights were happening on a narrow black line with two small characters - this time there is a full battle screen and animation is much better. The scene of transformation to wingman was especially impressive since it has \"Ching!\" real voice cry coming out and there have not been voiced games yet. There seems to be only two battles in the game though compared to four in the original. So with only 8 locations and two battles the game is really short and a perfect run can be done in 10 minutes if you know the exploration part already.", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "April 10, 1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "TamTam Co., Ltd.", "publishers": "Enix Corporation", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/6jPZxSP5qDw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/131064-wingman-2\n"}
