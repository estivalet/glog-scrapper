Now it's up to Ares, a brave soldier in the service of the Fairies, to save Chris. Demon Crystal is an action puzzle game. Scattered around the stage are numerous keys which help open locked areas. The goal is to find the big key which is needed to open the exit and advance to the next stage. Ares' only weapon is a limited number of bombs, which explode in a flame and can kill multiple enemies at once.
