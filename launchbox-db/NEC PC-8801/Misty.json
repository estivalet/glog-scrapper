This volume contains the following cases: Strange Naked Body, Red Fountain, Murderer's Laboratory, Tail Lights Disappearing in the Old City, and Decaying Family Tree. The game largely consists of text-only descriptions and dialogues, though some locations and scenes are accompanied by sparse black and white digitized photos.
