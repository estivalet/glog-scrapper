The hope is that the player will somehow be able to sabotage ASCII's magazine in order to dethrone them from their popularity, giving the player's magazine the opportunity to gain prominence. If the player succeeds, he will be promoted to editor-in-chief but if he fails he will be assigned menial tasks as punishment.", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hideki Akiyama", "publishers": "ASCII", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138624-omotesandou-adventure\n"}
