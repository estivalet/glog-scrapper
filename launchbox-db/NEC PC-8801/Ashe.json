{"altername_name": ["Ashe: Legend of 'Toma'"], "name": "Ashe", "overview": "Ashe is a side-view shooter with some platforming elements. The player can explore several interconnected areas, though certain locations can only be accessed in a specific order, after having fulfilled other objectives or acquired the necessary items. The player character uses his psionic ability to shoot energy balls at enemies, which causes his ESP level to be gradually depleted. Certain areas require jumping or climbing on structures to bypass.", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "May 1, 1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Quasar Soft", "publishers": "Quasar Soft", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvjIdc-KNUw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83398-ashe\n"}
