{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hole Chaser", "overview": "Daisuke's girlfriend Kasumi has asked him to write music for lyrics she's written, and being the upstanding young man he is, he accepts. Toiling for three days on the song, he finally finishes and can't wait to play it for Kasumi! He heads off to Kasumi's house and rings the bell, but her father answers and tells Daisuke that she hasn't returned from school yet. Moments later again, the phone rings. Kasumi has been kidnapped! Her father gives Daisuke a small UFO for some reason, and he rushes off to save her! Hole Chaser is a simple action game where the player must guide a rather unruly-to-operate UFO to the end of a maze. It will bounce off any hazards in the stage, and can't be crushed, but there is a strict time limit for each stage. Fail to complete the stage in time, and it's game over. Reach the goal, and the player is shown a short scene of Kasumi being sexually assaulted by her captor. The scenes get continually more explicit as the game progresses. There are six stages total, as well as a music mode for listening to the BGM.", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "April 24, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Sensui Software", "publishers": "Birdy Soft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138507-hole-chaser\n"}
