{"altername_name": [], "name": "Silver Ghost", "overview": "Silver Ghost is very loosely based on the Camelot cycle of legends, starring the legendary Lancelot - who, in this game, is a prince rather than a knight. Lancelot's father was killed by a demonic magician and his country overrun by his minions. The young prince must assemble a capable army and lead it to the enemy's stronghold. The game marks the first implementation of Kure Software Koubou's trademark \"gocha-kyara\" (\"mixed-up characters\") system. Essentially it is a hybrid of a role-playing and a real-time strategy game. Initially the player controls only Lancelot himself, but soon thereafter he becomes the leader of the first team, and eventually the player is put in control of several teams containing a dozen or more soldiers each. It is possible to switch between teams at almost any time and explore different areas. The player physically controls only the team leader, navigating him or her through interconnected overhead areas. Battles flow in real time and are automatized for everyone except the leader, which must be controlled manually. In order to prevail, however, it is necessary to assemble and outfit teams properly, judging the nature of upcoming battles in advance. Each team member has his or her own statistics and grows up in levels as they vanquish enemies.", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kure Software Koubou", "publishers": "Kure Software Koubou", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/MCHduQ6OnFg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/140133-silver-ghost\n"}
