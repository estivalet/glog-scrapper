{"altername_name": [], "name": "Advanced Fantasian: Quest for Lost Sanctuary", "overview": "Long ago, humans and other creatures lived peacefully in a magical paradise. However, one day a new star appeared nearby. A meteorite fell onto the Earth, turning it into a realm of perpetual darkness and misery. Humans managed to restore the land to its original state. But orcs, trolls, and other hostile races refused to give up their territory. Thus, the second age of peace quickly turned into an age of a new battle... Advanced Fantasian is a follow-up to Fantasian. Like its predecessor, it is a Western-style (despite its Japanese origins) role-playing game most closely resembling Wizardry games. Compared to the first game, it has enhanced visuals - graphical locations in the town as well as in the dungeon, as opposed to menus and vector graphics of the original. Gameplay system is more refined: the player can customize the characters' weapon proficiencies and a few skills. Turn-based combat takes place on separate screens and is more tactical than in the previous game: each character has action points that determine his or her mobility and attack range; characters can also face different directions, which influences their attacks and defense.", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Xtalsoft", "publishers": "XTALSOFT", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb-1nwYdoTc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/131011-advanced-fantasian-quest-for-lost-sanctuary\n"}
