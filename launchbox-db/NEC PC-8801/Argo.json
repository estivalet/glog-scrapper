{"altername_name": [], "name": "Argo", "overview": "Loosely based on the Greek myth of the Argonauts, Argo focuses on its central protagonist Iason (Jason), narrating a simple story that does not quite correspond to the known myth: Iason's father has been poisoned, and his native city Iolkos overrun by monsters known as Pontos. Iason must single-handedly eliminate them and save his homeland. Argo is a role-playing game set in a pseudo-3D continuous world. The player explores the environments from a first-person view. It is possible to try to talk to any encountered character, as well as attack anyone. Most battles take place within the exploration area and involve a fairly simple turn-based exchange of attacks. However, occasional fights against larger monsters take place on a separate screen, have an over-the-shoulder third-person perspective, and require the player to move and attack in real time. Experience points and gold are awarded for defeating enemies. It is necessary to feed the protagonist; when his condition is \"hungry\" food also restores a portion of his hit points.", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Kure Software Koubou", "publishers": "Kure Software Koubou", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137826-argo\n"}
