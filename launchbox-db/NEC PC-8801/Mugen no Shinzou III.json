{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mugen no Shinzou III", "overview": "After having traveled to two magical realms, the hero was finally able to leave the world of Elderein and return to his own world, Luizard. However, upon his arrival he discovered that his travels have caused a time slip of several billion years. His world is now being threatened by the God of Darkness. He must use the Heart of Phantasm he found during his first adventure, and locate other heroes who would aid him on his quest and liberate the land. Mugen no Shinz\u014d III is in many ways quite different from its Ultima-inspired predecessor. Story progression is more linear, exploration more restricted; characters with their own backgrounds join the party, taking a cue from Japanese RPG design. However, the game doesn't have anime aesthetics characteristic of these games. Enemies are visibly roaming the overworld and dungeons; an encounter leads to a separate top-down battle screen, on which combat proceeds in real time, unless the player interferes and manually assigns commands to the characters.", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "January 12, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Xtalsoft", "publishers": "XTALSOFT", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138613-mugen-no-shinzou-iii\n"}
