{"altername_name": [], "name": "Jigoku no Renshuu Mondai", "overview": "Jigoku no Renshuu Mondai (meaning \"Tests of Hell\") is a text adventure with graphics. The game casts the player in the role of a novice angel who has to travel to hell in order to get acquainted with its inhabitants and withstand its trials. The player navigates the angel by typing N, W, E, and S representing the four directions, and inputting commands consisting of verbs and nouns to interact with characters and environment. Hell is populated by various famous characters with very different degrees of ethical credibility justifying their presence in such a place, ranging from Adolf Hitler to John Lennon. Most characters will ask the angel simple historical questions (e.g. Napoleon will inquire about his country of origin); answering these correctly will usually yield an item that can be used in other locations to retrieve further items, bypass various dangers, etc. The player character may get killed if the player chooses a wrong response or travels to a hazardous area without a corresponding item. Game progression is non-linear: almost all of the fifty or so screens are accessible from the beginning.", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Humming Bird Soft", "publishers": "Humming Bird Soft", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138524-jigoku-no-renshuu-mondai\n"}
