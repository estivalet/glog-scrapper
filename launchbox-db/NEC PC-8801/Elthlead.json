{"altername_name": [], "name": "Elthlead", "overview": "Bozel, the King of the East and the Dark Mage. He is a king who is fascinated by the power of the dark side, which has a powerful and overwhelming power. He is devoured by madness day by day, turning the whole world into darkness and reviving the unclean people deeper underground. Neighboring countries are all overrun, and their momentum never stops. Meanwhile, Sieghard, king of Elslead and magician of light, senses the evil power of darkness beyond the northern mountains. Realizing the urgency, he immediately forms a knight order. We cannot forgive darkness in the name of God. Sieghard's sword turns north. Elthlead is the first game in what is known as the Elthlead Trilogy, the other two games being Crest of Gaia and Guyframe. This game provided the basic building blocks for the world of Gaia which is seen not only in the Trilogy but also the later Langrisser series as well. Characters such as Sieghart and Boser ultimately derive from this series and several of the units from Langrisser are certainly influenced by this earlier game such as Grand Knights from Langrisser I and Grand Dinos from this game. Elthlead is also notable for being the first fantasy SLG game ever developed. While most SLG fans look back to Master of Monsters or Fire Emblem as the origin of the genre, these games were released in 1988 and 1990 respectively.", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "March 20, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "NCS", "publishers": "NCS", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/140025-elthlead\n"}
