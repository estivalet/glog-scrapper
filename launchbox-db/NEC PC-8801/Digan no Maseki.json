{"altername_name": [], "name": "Digan no Maseki", "overview": "A wedding ceremony is held in the village of Kartia, in the country of Oro. The warrior Dino is marrying the beautiful Abiria. After the wedding, the young couple heads to the sacred spring to inquire about their future. However, the goddess tells the newlyweds that pain and separation await them. Distressed, they return to the village, and shortly afterwards a terrible disease consumes Abiria. The local doctor explains that it might be a magical curse. In order to save his beloved one, Dino has to travel to faraway lands in search for a cure... Digan no Maseki incorporates Western RPG elements into the Japanese template. Along with the menu-driven turn-based battles and simple character growth system, the game also features a day/night cycle; the heroes can get tired and hungry, so buying rations for longer trips is essential. It is also possible to purchase horses for faster travel. Another feature more typical for Western RPGs are conversation topics and freedom of action. Certain NPCs can be attacked at will, even if their disposition is friendly. Others will offer as vast choice of topics to discuss, ranging from general information about the game's lore and more mundane problems. A \"show\" commands even allows to hear NPCs' opinions about items in the party's inventory. Visually, Digan no Maseki also resembles Western games, retaining little of the traditional anime/manga aesthetics.", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Artec", "publishers": "Artec", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/r-T8NBmtkpo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/140013-digan-no-maseki\n"}
