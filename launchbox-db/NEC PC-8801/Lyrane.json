{"altername_name": [], "name": "Lyrane", "overview": "In the future, humans began to build space stations, on which special army units were always present to ensure that nothing threatens humanity from the depth of the cosmos. One of such space stations was called Lyrane. However, the master computer that was monitoring life support on Lyrane has gone insane. Machines have taken over the station, and its human residents were annihilated. The Earth sends a lone fighter craft to Lyrane on what looks like a suicide mission... Lyrane is an action game that differs in several aspects from traditional arcade shooters. The view is top-down, but not vertically-scrolling; player-controlled aircraft can move in any direction (including diagonally), stopping at will. The controls are character-based rather than camera-oriented, i.e. pressing the \"forward\" button will always make the aircraft move forward, regardless of its position on the screen. Combat is less frequent than in arcade shooters, and the player is required to explore the large levels in order to find ammunition, defeat the enemies, and advance to the next stage.", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Glodia", "publishers": "Bullet-Proof Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138586-lyrane\n"}
