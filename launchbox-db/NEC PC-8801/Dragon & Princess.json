{"altername_name": ["The Dragon & Princess"], "name": "Dragon & Princess", "overview": "Commonly considered the first Japanese-made game with role-playing elements, Dragon and Princess involves a quest of a party of adventurers who is requested by the king to exterminate bandits and eventually rescue the princess from the clutches of a dragon. Gameplay-wise, the game is for the most part closer to the adventure format than to true role-playing. Much of the game consists of text and plays like interactive fiction, with text-based commands and movement through maze-like environments achieved by typing letters corresponding to the four directions (N, S, W and E). The RPG element is manifested in tactical top-down battles, during which the player navigates characters in a turn-based fashion. It is possible to take cover and protect weaker allies. Dead characters cannot be resurrected afterwards.", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Koei", "publishers": "Koei", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/157925-dragon-princess\n"}
