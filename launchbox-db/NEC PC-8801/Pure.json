{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pure", "overview": "In this game, the player takes control of Akira Tadokoro, a 17-year-old exchange student. He attends the new school for one year only, because of his father's job. Afterwards, he'll have to go back - so there is no time to lose! The boy must do something about all those pretty girls in his school. But in order to capture their hearts, he will have to know them better... Pure is a Japanese-style adventure game that takes place entirely in the school. At each location of the school (classroom, tennis court, etc.), the player is given the same menu of commands, which are Look, Talk, Ask, Show, Move, Search, Use, and Give. Each of these commands list to a sub-menu of selectable objects; the last two deal with inventory items the player might obtain. There are no real puzzles, but at certain points the player has to do more than just try to trigger the next scene - asking the right question or showing the right item might do the trick.", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "May 15, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Queen Soft", "publishers": "Queen Soft", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147033-pure\n"}
