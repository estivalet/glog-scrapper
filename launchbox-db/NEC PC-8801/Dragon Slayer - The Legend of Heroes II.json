{"altername_name": ["Dragon Slayer: Eiy\u016b Densetsu II"], "name": "Dragon Slayer: The Legend of Heroes II", "overview": "Dragon Slayer: The Legend of Heroes II is part of the Dragon Slayer series and the second entry in the sub-series The Legend of Heroes. The game is set approximately 20 years after the events of the first game. The protagonist spots strange beings in spacesuits outside of the capital city. They do not recognize the spacesuits and believe them to be monsters. The second Dragon Slayer is very similar to the first game, graphically and gameplay-wise. The only major difference is the fact that the enemies are now completely visible on screen before battles, so that the player can avoid fighting them if he wants to. Otherwise, it is a traditional Japanese RPG with turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective.", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "March 19, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Nihon Falcom", "publishers": "Nihon Falcom", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Slayer:_The_Legend_of_Heroes_II", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/107833-dragon-slayer-the-legend-of-heroes-ii\n"}
