{"altername_name": ["Bubblegam Crisis"], "name": "Bubblegum Crisis: Crime Wave", "overview": "Bubblegum Crisis: Crime Wave is a Simulation game, developed and published by Victor Interactive Software, which was released in Japan in 1989 Based on the characters rather than directly on the OAV series. The opening sequence explains that an unexpected Boomer attack is taking place in Downtown Megatokyo. A mysterious imposter from the AD Police seems to be involved and shortly after Nene goes missing. The game begins in Sylia's apartment where you choose which Knight Saber will uncover Nene's mysterious disappearance. Controlling the game is simple; arrow keys move your character and you speak to others with the Space Bar. The only other key you need is Escape which sends you back to Sylia's apartment. This comes in very handy as, not only can you change character here, but also the locations are large and just roaming around will cause you to get very lost.", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Cross Media Soft", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/wqdFL5hKnt0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/132169-bubblegum-crisis-crime-wave\n"}
