{"altername_name": [], "name": "Twilight Zone II: Nagisa no Yakata", "overview": "Y\u014dko, the protagonist's girlfriend, has disappeared. In order to find her he must venture into the dreaded mansion inhabited by sex-hungry women. Though the game has a similar setting as its predecessor, gameplay-wise it is entirely different, being a first-person dungeon-crawling RPG. The environment in the game consists of several floors of identically-looking maze-like pseudo-3D corridors. There is no automapping feature. Enemies would randomly pop up; all of them are young girls, and the protagonist must have sex with them instead of fighting. Different sexual positions correspond to different types of attacks in more conventional role-playing games. Items and most other RPG-related paraphernalia are also expressed through sexual terms. Experience points and currency (which can be spent on items and resting in special locations) are awarded as well.", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Great", "publishers": "Great", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138703-twilight-zone-ii-nagisa-no-yakata\n"}
