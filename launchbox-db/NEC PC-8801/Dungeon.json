{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dungeon", "overview": "Rumors say that somewhere in the land of Zargos lies a hidden passage to the glorious country of Eldorado. Only the bravest adventurer dares to enter the labyrinthine caves scattered across Zargos to uncover the entrance to the miraculous land. Dungeon is a fantasy role-playing game influenced by early Ultima installments. Character creation involves selecting one of the five available classes (Fighter, Priest, Magic User, Thief and Ninja) and determining their attributes by allocating a few remaining points. Like in Ultima games, the gameplay is divided into top-down word exploration (though on a significantly smaller map) and pseudo-3D first-person dungeon crawling. Combat flows in real time, i.e. enemies would approach or attack without waiting for the player's input. Battles take place in the overworld or dungeons without entering separate screens. It is necessary to buy food rations to prevent the player character from starving.", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Koei", "publishers": "Koei", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138435-dungeon\n"}
