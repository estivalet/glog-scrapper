{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hotel Wars", "overview": "Hotel Wars is a business simulation game where players build a chain of hotels in Europe. Up to 4 players can compete against the CPU. The game has a fixed period of time and doesn't tell players what their CPU competitor is doing. There are 18 European cities available and players are given 9 options to choose during their turns. They can build hotels, hire chefs and managers, train them, get loans from banks, buy or sell stocks to increase their revenue. Players can use a telephone to call financial advisors that will give them information about their competitors, an insurance company to avoid losing too much money in case of a fire, a Yakuza member who will help players hijack their competitor's hotel (At the cost of extorting money from the player each month) and the police which will fine players for using the services of the Yakuza but will protect them from future payments to the mafia. Players can also take over the hotels of their competitors. Players that have gone bankrupt will have their hotels bought out by their competition. The game progresses on a monthly basis and each time players choose what to do, the game displays their monthly earnings and losses. Economic factors also play a key role in the game as the game pinpoints the state of economy during gameplay. In order to win this game, players must be the first to build a chain of 10 hotels and make a revenue of $5000000. In case no player has achieved this goal, the game continues until the deadline assigned by the player in the beginning of the game.", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Bothtec", "publishers": "Bothtec", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138511-hotel-wars\n"}
