{"altername_name": [], "name": "Combat Simulator: Battle Gorilla", "overview": "Despite its title, Combat Simulator: Battle Gorilla has nothing to do with the well-known large African primates, but rather with guerrilla combat. It is a top-down action game that has certain similarities with Commando, but with a much more tactical approach and extended simulation elements. Before the combat begins, the player selects one of the eight available maps. Each map features different terrain, enemy types, and overall difficulty level. The player has the option to scout the map in a safe mode before the actual battle. It is also necessary to equip the protagonist with various kinds of firearms. Precise characteristics of each weapons are displayed, so that the player is able to outfit the hero fittingly for the upcoming operation. The combat itself is tactical, having a nearly turn-based element: all the action is paused whenever the protagonist stops moving. Enemy units consist of soldiers equipped with various types of firearms, tanks, and (in some maps) planes and combat helicopters. Enemy soldiers would position themselves behind cover or in fortified locations, sit in trenches, try to surround the hero, etc. Both the protagonist and the enemies can swim, with the speed visibly decreased.", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Xtalsoft", "publishers": "XTALSOFT", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/0L_nLhJYd7M", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138393-combat-simulator-battle-gorilla\n"}
