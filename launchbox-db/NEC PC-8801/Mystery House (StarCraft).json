{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mystery House (StarCraft)", "overview": "Mystery House is a monochrome interactive fiction adventure game that places the player in a Victorian mansion with seven other people. As the player explores the mansion, he discovers that there is a killer murdering each guest one by one. The objective of the game is to figure out who the murderer is before the murderer finds the hero. Players explore and manipulate objects by typing in one or two-word phrases such as \"north\" or \"get knife\". In Japan, several different adventure games under the title Mystery House were released. In 1982, MicroCabin released Mystery House, which was unrelated to (but inspired by) the On-Line Systems game of the same name. The following year, the Japanese company StarCraft released an enhanced remake of On-Line Systems' Mystery House with more realistic artwork and depiction of blood. This version is the one ported by StarCraft.", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Starcraft", "publishers": "StarCraft", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_House", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/157715-mystery-house-starcraft\n"}
