Designed by Isozaki Hideaki, this is the first computer game adaptation of the Golgo 13 franchise, starring the titular assassin/hitman Golgo 13. It is an early adventure game that appears to revolve around a murder mystery, much like Portopia Serial Murder Case before it. In addition, Golgo 13 features more control over the character's movement, having the player navigating around mazes in a first-person perspective; this element would later appear in segments of the NES port of Portopia as well as later Golgo 13 games like Wolf Schampe, Top Secret Episode and The Mafat Conspiracy.", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "August 1, 1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Pony Canyon", "publishers": "Pony Canyon", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/132534-golgo-13-moretti-ichizoku-zansatsu-jiken\n"}
