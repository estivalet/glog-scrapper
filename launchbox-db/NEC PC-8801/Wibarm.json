{"altername_name": ["WiBArm"], "name": "Wibarm", "overview": "Wibarm, stylized as WiBArM, is an early role-playing shooter released by Arsys Software for the NEC PC-88 computer in Japan. It combines run and gun shooter gameplay with role-playing video game elements, and was also the first action role-playing game to feature 3D polygonal graphics. In Wibarm, the player controls a transformable mecha robot that can shift between walking mode, a tank, and a flying jet. The viewpoint switches between several different perspectives: a 2D top-down perspective while flying, a side-scrolling view during on-foot outdoor exploration, a fully 3D polygonal third-person perspective inside buildings, and arena-style 2D shoot 'em up battles during boss encounters. The game features a variety of weapons and equipment as well as an automap, and the player can upgrade equipment and earn experience to raise stats. In contrast to first-person RPGs at the time that were restricted to 90-degree movements, Wibarm's use of 3D polygons allows full 360-degree movement.", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "August 1, 1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Arsys Software", "publishers": "Arsys Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/89263-wibarm\n"}
