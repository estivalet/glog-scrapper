{"altername_name": [], "name": "Kidou Senshi Gundam Part 1: Gundam Daishi ni Tatsu", "overview": "This is the first of a two-part series, followed by Kidou Senshi Gundam Part 2: Tobe Gundam in 1984. Part 1 is based on the first three episodes of the Mobile Suit Gundam television series, while the sequel is based on episodes 4-12 of the series. Referring to itself as a \"ROLE-VENTURE\" game, or \"real-time role-playing adventure game\", this was an adventure game with visual novel and RPG elements, along with shooter segments. In the shooter segments, the controls involve using the 2, 4, 6 and 8 keys to aim and the Space key to fire. Its sequel, Kidou Senshi Gundam Part 2: Tobe Gundam, expanded on the RPG and shooter elements. The game's approach to combining several different genres would later be employed in other Gundam games that followed, including Tobe Gundam, Mobile Suit Gundam: Last Shooting, and Z Gundam: Hot Scramble.", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Rapport", "publishers": "Rapport", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/136807-kidou-senshi-gundam-part-1-gundam-daishi-ni-tatsu\n"}
