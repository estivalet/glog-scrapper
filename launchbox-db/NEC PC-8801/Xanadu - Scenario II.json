{"altername_name": [], "name": "Xanadu: Scenario II", "overview": "Xanadu: Scenario 2 is an expansion pack to Xanadu: Dragon Slayer II. Just like the original game, it is not particularly story-driven; once again, the player is thrown into the medieval fantasy world as a lone nameless hero, who must explore the maze-like environments and stay alive in the process. This add-on scenario features new, more complex maps, new enemies (including bosses), and a trading system which allows purchasing items in one shop and selling them for profit in another. Otherwise, the gameplay system remains identical to that of the predecessor; with side-scrolling exploration, separate top-down battle screens, \"bumping\" action-based combat, and role-playing system with levelling up, equipment, etc. The game requires the original Xanadu to play; character creation must be done with the original game discs inserted, after which the player can directly access this scenario.", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Nihon Falcom", "publishers": "Nihon Falcom", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138725-xanadu-scenario-ii\n"}
