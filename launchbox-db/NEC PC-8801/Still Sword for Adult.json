{"altername_name": [], "name": "Still Sword for Adult", "overview": "For years, the magical realm of Forfaral existed in balance thanks to the power of five princesses, protectors of its land. However, the evil sorceress Inkoma abducted the princesses and locked them in castles populated by monsters. It is up to a brave female warrior to rescue the princesses and restore peace. Still Sword for Adult is very similar to its non-hentai counterpart visually and gameplay-wise. Like the previous game, it is an action RPG in which the protagonist explores maze-like passages and fights monsters for experience, money, and items. An added twist in this installment are erotic lesbian scenes that occur whenever the protagonist liberates the princesses.", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "July 8, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "FairyTale", "publishers": "FairyTale", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138682-still-sword-for-adult\n"}
