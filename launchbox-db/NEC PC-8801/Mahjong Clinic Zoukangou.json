The player character visits his little sister in a hospital, and ends up challenging nurses, patients, and other people to mahjong matches. The player can choose locations from a map (hospital rooms, reception area, etc.), which leads to a short scene and a mahjong game. These encounters can be tackled in a different order, but have to be completed in order to open new areas.
