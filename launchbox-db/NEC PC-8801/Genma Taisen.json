{"altername_name": [], "name": "Genma Taisen", "overview": "The Judgment Day is nearing. An ancient demonic race is ready to invade and conquer Earth. Luna, a Transylvanian princess who can predict the future, senses the impending danger. She summons Vega, a 200-year-old robot, and together they must find psionic masters across the globe and brace themselves for the final battle. Based on the manga series of the same name and released simultaneously with the movie Harmagedon: The Great Battle with Genma (1983), Genma Taisen is (despite its self-designation as a \"role-playing adventure\") essentially a visual novel. Though there are characters with attributes and psionic powers assigned to them, game advancement is automated and player input is reduced to making choices (mostly \"Yes\" or \"No\") or occasionally selecting a character and an attack type for an upcoming confrontation. Right choices advance the game while wrong ones lead to Game Over. There is no movement or any type of character management in the game.", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Pony Canyon", "publishers": "Pony Canyon", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138483-genma-taisen\n"}
