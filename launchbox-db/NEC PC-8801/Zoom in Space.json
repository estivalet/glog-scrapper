{"altername_name": [], "name": "Zoom in Space", "overview": "Zoom in Space is a simple arcade-style shooting game whose pseudo-3D perspective and ship designs are both modeled after Buck Rogers: Planet of Zoom. Armed with simple twin-shot cannons, you move your ship vertically and side-to-side while enemies approach from up ahead to ram you. Only one enemy sprite can appear at a time, so the next attacker will only appear once the current ship has been successfully dodged or shot. Three types of enemy ships attack in a never-ending loop, and the game's only goal is to attain a high score by shooting down as many as possible before losing all three of your lives.", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Riverhill Soft", "publishers": "Riverhill Soft", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/oyCQhmzvEcU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138734-zoom-in-space\n"}
