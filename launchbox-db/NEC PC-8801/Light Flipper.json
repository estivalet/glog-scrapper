{"altername_name": [], "name": "Light Flipper", "overview": "Light Flipper is a puzzle platformer where the player takes control of the titular character, a green little creature. The game consists of single screen levels and the objective in each is to collect all keys so that an exit opens up. Each level has a river at the bottom where the player enters on a raft from the right with the exit being on the left side. The player character can climb walls and will automatically do so when using the jump button to move vertically. Creatures roam the levels and these have to be avoided or else the player will lose a life. It is also necessary to avoid falling rocks and jumping into the water. Oxygen is limited and will run out unless the player picks up oxygen tanks that replenishes it. To kill the enemies flash lights has to be collected. After being activated they work similarly to power pills in Pac-Man and allows the player to go after the enemies for a brief moment. Additionally there are pots that can be collected for bonus points.", "platform": "NEC PC-8801", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Enix Corporation", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/131083-light-flipper\n"}
