{"altername_name": [], "name": "Habitat II", "overview": "Habitat II (\u30cf\u30d3\u30bf\u30c3\u30c8\uff12) is a piece of Sega Saturn software released exclusively in Japan. It was a Saturn based game client for Fujitsu's \"Habitat II\" virtual world which itself was a licensed version of Fujitsu's WorldsAway virtual world launched September 1995. The service was initially made available online to Windows users in March 1996 and 4 months later the Saturn client was released. It is reasonably likely that this would have been cross platform so Windows/Saturn users would be able to play on the same server. It is completely reliant on the Sega Saturn Modem due to the client/server relationship and thus cannot function in the modern age.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "July 27, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/125139-habitat-ii\n"}
