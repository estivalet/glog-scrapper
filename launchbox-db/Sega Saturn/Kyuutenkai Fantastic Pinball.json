This game also offers living bumpers, wandering enemies, and bonus rounds that take place outside of the main table. The character art and background designs are of an anime style. You can select from three different characters before the plunger is pulled. They each have their own attributes that affect how the game is played. The pinball can also be powered up, allowing it to hit enemies and obstacles for greater damage.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "August 25, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "TechnoSoft", "publishers": "Technosoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.44", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90905-kyuutenkai-fantastic-pinball\n"}
