{"altername_name": ["K-1 Fighting Illusion Shou", "K-1 Grand Prix: Fighting Illusion Shou"], "name": "K-1 Fighting Illusion Show", "overview": "K1 Fighting Illusion Show is by far the best boxing game available for the Saturn. XING really did a good job in bringing this Asian sport featuring many types of arts to the Saturn. The Saturn port features all the best fighters of the time (1997) such as the now deceased Andy Hug, Ernest Hoost, Peter Aerts and Nobuaki Kakuta. The arenas are fully 3D with multiple camera angles to choose from and nice solid looking fighters which are also quite big for a full 3D game. Games like Sega's fighters as classed as fully 3D however I disagree since the backgrounds are 2D. Many modes of play are available to choose from starting with the standard 1 & 2 Player Vs modes as well as Tournament and Team Battle modes. Plus there's even an AI setup mode. If you're looking for a different type of fighter other than the standard Sega fighters or Capcom / SNK 2D fighters then I recommend K1 Fighting Illusion Show.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "January 31, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Daft", "publishers": "Xing Entertainment", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90897-k-1-fighting-illusion-show\n"}
