{"altername_name": ["Baroque Report: CD Data File"], "name": "Baroque", "overview": "The Armageddon came. A huge Heat Wave ruined the planet, humans have mutated into strange creatures who worship strange gods, trying to exterminate each other in bloody wars, and Ikei demons populate the surface of the planet. In the middle of the wasteland stands the Nerve Tower. Nobody knows what it is: the symbol of evil or the final hope for salvation, because nobody ever dared to enter it. But the hero of the game is determined to explore the tower, and perhaps to cleanse the world of evil once and for all. Baroque is horror-themed action game with elements of survival gameplay. The whole game is set in the tower: you slowly work your way to the top, fighting demons as you progress. You have HP as well as stamina gauge. If your stamina is depleted, you walk slower and can't react well in a battle.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "May 21, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Sting Entertainment", "publishers": "Entertainment Software Publishing", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.06", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baroque_(video_game)", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2iO5NzE_ik", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/31302-baroque\n"}
