{"altername_name": [], "name": "Space Jam", "overview": "Based on the movie of the same name, Space Jam centres around an invasion of Looney Tunes land by tiny aliens. The fate of the Tunes is to be decided by a basketball game, and for this the aliens turn into the huge, evil Monstars. The game is about two thirds basketball sim and then minigames are stuck in to fill all the gaps. You can play as the Monstars or the Looney Tunes who have the help of Michael Jordan. The basketball games themselves come in two flavours, two-on-two and three-on-three.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "November 26, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Sculptured Software", "publishers": "Acclaim Entertainment", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.67", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Jam_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nz9m-0osiOw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/10926-space-jam\n"}
