The game was released in Japan for Sega Saturn and ST-V arcade board. The game plays like the Columns game series, except you play as members of the Imperial Floral Assault Troupe. Each member has their own strengths and weaknesses as pertains to playing. As an added bonus, while playing you can perform attacks against your opponent similar to the special attacks in the Sakura Wars series. You can also eliminate some of the lower gems in your area. These can both be performed after creating enough gem chains to fill up your super meter. You can also store your attacks to make them even more powerful the next time you fill the meter. At the third storage, you must either attack, erase some of your gems, or you can store it up to get three butterfly like blocks that the bottom block will eliminate all of one color, whichever color block it touches. The game ends when either you or your opponent's gem area is filled to the top, leaving no room for more gems.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "March 28, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Sega CS2", "publishers": "Sega Enterprises", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/91045-sakura-taisen-hanagumi-taisen-columns\n"}
