{"altername_name": [], "name": "Shingata Kururin Pa!", "overview": "Shingata Kururin Pa! is a falling-block puzzle, where you have a dual with an AI (or human) player, released for the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn console in 1996; both versions seem to be the same in every aspect except some sound effects. In 2012, the game available for download on the Japanese PlayStation Store was released as PSone Classics for the PlayStation 3 (PS3), PlayStation Portable (PSP), PlayStation Vita (PS Vita) and PlayStation Vita TV (PS Vita TV). In this game, many different types of blocks fall from the sky. You try to clear them by piecing together fuses and bombs, then using fire to light the fuses and blow up the bombs in order to attack your opponent. Additionally, you can also change fire blocks into fire packs (which look like a lantern), then you can turn the fire packs into new fires again; these new features of the rules allow you to make chain, which incredibly increase your attack power. Story \u2013 Four years later from a previous Kururinpa tournament, the next one is to be held shortly. Ten challengers from all over the world have come to get the opportunity to meet King Paro-Paru, who is the host of the event and can make any of the winner's wishes come true. Who will be the winner this year...?", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "August 9, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Sky Think Systems", "publishers": "Sky Think Systems", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/91068-shingata-kururin-pa\n"}
