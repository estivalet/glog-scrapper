{"altername_name": [], "name": "Daitoride", "overview": "Daitoride (loosely translated to \"Great Fortress\", also known as D\u00e0 P\u00e1i Zh\u00e0i) is a mahjong solitaire game. The third game in the Toride series (after Toride II), Daitoride changes up the matching mechanics by having players form mahjong-style melds of three tiles (either matches or sequences). Players can no longer match pairs and, to compensate for this, they are given eight-tile hands instead of seven-tile hands.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "June 28, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Metro", "publishers": "Metro", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90731-daitoride\n"}
