{"altername_name": ["Fatal Fury 3: Road to the Final Victory"], "name": "Garou Densetsu 3: Road to the Final Victory", "overview": "Fatal Fury 3 retains the format and controls of the previous game in the series, Fatal Fury Special. However, the two-plane battle stages have been revamped into a three plane format known as the Oversway System. The player fights primarily in the middle plane or the main plane, but can move or \"oversway\" into either of the sway lines at the background (LP+LK) or foreground (LK+HP). When the player performs an attack in a sway plane (or an Oversway Attack), their character will return to the main plane. Likewise, the player can attack an opponent who is in a Sway Plane with an Anti-Oversway Attack. The player can also do a \"Quick Sway\" to avoid an attack, leaving the opponent vulnerable to a regular attack. Other new techniques introduced in this installment includes controlling the height of the character's jump, block an opponent's attack at mid-air (Air Guard), and a new type of combo techniques known as Combination Arts, allowing the player to cancel a specific series (which varies between characters) of regular attacks from one to the other. In addition to the regular Special Moves, and the Super Special Moves which can only be performed when the life gauge is flashing red, each character also has a \"Hidden Ability\", which is a stronger version of a Super Special Move. A Hidden Ability occurs once in every 1024 chances whenever the player inputs the command for the character's Super Special Move. A Hidden Ability can also be used by activating \"Super Mode\" before a match using a secret code. The player then enters a specific command for the Hidden Ability when the life gauge is flashing red. Unlike Super Special Moves, a Hidden Ability can only be used once per round. Fatal Fury 3 also features a Fighting Level system when fighting against the computer. When the player completes a round, their performance is graded from D to SSS. The final opponents the player faces at the end of the Single Player Mode is determined then by the player's average.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "June 28, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "SNK", "publishers": "SNK", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.1", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatal_Fury_3:_Road_to_the_Final_Victory", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxjfpc3R86o", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/87591-garou-densetsu-3-road-to-the-final-victory\n"}
