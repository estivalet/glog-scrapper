{"altername_name": [], "name": "Metal Fighter Miku", "overview": "In the year 2061, technological advancements have allowed humans to surpass the limits of the weak human body. A new form of entertainment called Neo Pro Wrestling, which allows combatants to use powered armor and other enhancements, is rapidly gaining in popularity. The Pretty Four are a team of teenage wrestlers/pop idols, riding high after their newest member, Miku, snatched a world championship victory. Suddenly, a new tournament is announced by a mysterious new group called The Lion's Den, and Miku and the Pretty Four decide to take on the challenge. Metal Fighter Miku is a Japanese-style adventure/simulation game based on the 1994 animated series of the same name. It features a new scenario in six chapters set six months after the events of the show, essentially functioning as a sequel. The player controls Miku and must develop her abilities and ultimately win each match as the story progresses. The game is divided into two main sections. Most of the story plays out in standard visual novel-style dialogue sequences, with occasional choices that affect the flow of the conversation. Wrestling matches play out as real-time sequences where the player must select actions from a menu; available actions and current fighter status are shown at the bottom of the screen, while the top of the screen shows large illustrations of the match in action. Matches can be decided by pinfall, count out, or submission.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "September 29, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Feycraft", "publishers": "Victor Entertainment", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/107105-metal-fighter-miku\n"}
