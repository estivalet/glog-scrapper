{"altername_name": [], "name": "WWF In Your House", "overview": "WWF In Your House is a successor to WWF WrestleMania: The Arcade Game. Like its predecessor, it is a hybrid of wrestling game and arcade versus fighter, with over-the-top, unrealistic moves. Concept and presentation are similar to Mortal Kombat games: digitized sprites are used to represent the wrestlers, and the game features finished moves that are performed before the final pin. There are a total of ten WWF wrestlers in the game: The British Bulldog, Goldust, Bret Hart, Owen Hart, Hunter Hearst Helmsley, Ahmed Johnson, Shawn Michaels, The Ultimate Warrior, The Undertaker, and Vader. A new four-player mode is available.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "November 8, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Sculptured Software", "publishers": "Acclaim Entertainment", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.15", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWF_in_Your_House", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B03oh27KuHs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/10954-wwf-in-your-house\n"}
