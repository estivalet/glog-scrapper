{"altername_name": [], "name": "Master of Monsters: Neo Generations", "overview": "Master of Monsters: Neo Generations is a fantasy-themed, turn-based hex strategy game and part of SystemSoft's Master of Monsters series. Like previous games in the series, each player controls a Master who can summon various creatures onto the battlefield to fight for them. These creatures can be upgraded and fused to increase their power and evolve them into more advanced forms, are consistent across maps once summoned, and are gone permanently if killed. The goal of each battle is to defeat the opposing master; if a master is killed, all their creatures vanish from the map and they lose the battle. In the main story mode, the player selects one of six masters each with different abilities, backstory, and pool of available summon creatures. Over a series of battles on varied maps the player must defeat the other five masters and, ultimately, Gaia himself to claim his throne. There is also a map-select mode where any map can be played outside the story mode, a vs mode for two players, and a map-edit mode. A heavily revised PlayStation port which replaces the master characters with more anime-style designs, adds an in-depth story component, and redesigns some of the maps was released the following year as Master of Monsters: Disciples of Gaia.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "October 26, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "SystemSoft", "publishers": "Toshiba-EMI", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/107101-master-of-monsters-neo-generations\n"}
