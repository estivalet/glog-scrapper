{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dark Savior", "overview": "The bounty hunter Garian is entrusted with the task of accompanying a monster named Bilan to a prison island. On the ship, Bilan escapes, and Garian must stop him before he reaches the captain's cabin... ...at which point the game's narrative is split into three different scenarios (called Parallels), which depend on how much time it has taken the player to reach the captain. Parallel I occurs if the player needed more than four minutes; in this scenario, Bilan escapes and goes on a killing spree, and Garian must catch him again. Should the player need between three and four minutes to reach the captain, Parallel II is triggered; Garian defeats Bilan, but the monster undergoes a surprising transformation, and Garian realizes that a deeper plot has to be uncovered. Finally, if the player manages to reach the captain under three minutes, Parallel III begins, with Bilan being confined, but escaping once again. Dark Savior is a 3D action game with elements of platforming, puzzle-solving, and battles that resembles fights of a fighting game. The player navigates Garian through 3D environment, but the view switches to isometric perspective once a fight is triggered.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "November 30, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "Climax Entertainment", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.08", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Savior", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/10805-dark-savior\n"}
