{"altername_name": [], "name": "Shinseiki Evangelion: 2nd Impression", "overview": "This is the second Neon Genesis Evangelion \"interactive anim\u00e9\" for Saturn. The events of the game take place just after Episode 14 of the TV series. A new girl called Magumi arrives to the school where the hero of the series Shinji Ikari studies. The two start developing feelings for each other, when a new Angel attacks. The player controls Shinji through series of decisions (there are now three or four choices each time, as opposed to the prior game that had only two, and a branching story line) and through the fights. Much of the movie footage depicting combat is presented in 3D. The player selects moves from time to time; correct selections lead to the continuation of the movie - and hence, the game.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "March 7, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Sega AM2", "publishers": "Sega Enterprises", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/107172-shinseiki-evangelion-2nd-impression\n"}
