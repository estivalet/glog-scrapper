The game sees you picking one of a motley crew of boarders and taking to the slopes as you try to get the best times and/or scores on each slope. Courses from Canada to Italy to Japan are available, as well as the option to play on a half-pipe purely for points and an Alpine track for time attacks. In addition, the game boasts a number of unlockable characters and locations. It also features a replay system with editable camera/graphics effects, and thanks to the Saturn's clock you'll find yourself boarding at the various locales at an appropriate time of day relative to the system clock setting.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "December 18, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Cave", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.72", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/10927-steep-slope-sliders\n"}
