More animated strip mahjong awaits in the seventh arcade game in the Super Real Mahjong series. Challenge three more lovely girls, Yurina Asahina, Natsuki Asahina, and Serika Randoh, and they'll take their clothes off for you. And if you win at least one match with a baiman hand or higher, the fun won't end with just the three of them...", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "May 21, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "SETA", "publishers": "SETA", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/91439-super-real-mahjong-p-7\n"}
