As a two CD set, the game was accompanied by a Premium disk that featured some of the most beautiful matte art ever conceived for a video game, along with singular item and character designs. Essentially, Nanatsu Kaze no Shima Monogatari is an interactive storybook whose illustrated chapters reflect the game\u2019s very own narrative, with a new chapter being added every time the player successfully completes a group of tasks.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "November 27, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Givro", "publishers": "Enix", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/91000-nanatsu-kaze-no-shima-monogatari\n"}
