{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tokimeki Memorial: Forever With You", "overview": "This is an updated version of the first Tokimeki Memorial. This version has improved graphics and sound, new cut-scenes, and new mini-games. You are a young boy who is going to study three years at the Kirameki High School in Japan. Your goal is to win the affection of one (and possibly more) of the twelve beautiful girls who also study with you, especially of Shiori, with whom you were in love some years ago. This is a simulation game with a high-developed statistics system. You have to increase your statistics in different disciplines, depending on the girl you are interested in. You communicate with people via your telephone, and date girls by going with them to various places. You have to keep your promises, otherwise a girl will become angry and even tell bad things about you to other girls, which will spoil your reputation.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "July 19, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Life Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/30103-tokimeki-memorial-forever-with-you\n"}
