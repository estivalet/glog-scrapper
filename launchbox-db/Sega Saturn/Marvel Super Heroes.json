{"altername_name": [], "name": "Marvel Super Heroes", "overview": "Marvel Super Heroes is a fighting game in which superheroes and villains from the Marvel universe fight against each other. The aim of the game is to use attacks and special abilities to knock out your opponent, or possess more life than him/her at the end of the round. Throughout the match, players build up a super meter which can be used to perform powerful Infinity Combo attacks. A unique mechanic in the game are the Infinity Gems; Power, Time, Space, Reality, Soul and Mind. These gems can be earned by obtaining them from opponents during arcade mode, or by fulfilling certain criteria during versus mode, such as getting the first hit. By using these gems in battle, fighters receive enhanced effects for a short amount of time, such as increased power or defense, health recovery or additional attacks. Also, certain fighters will receive extra benefits whilst using certain gems. For example, if Spider-Man uses the Power gem, he can create a doppelganger on the opposite side of his opponent for extra damage during his attacks.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "October 2, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Capcom", "publishers": "Capcom", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/10872-marvel-super-heroes\n"}
