{"altername_name": ["Ippatsu Gyakuten: Gambling King e no Michi"], "name": "Ippatsu Gyakuten: Gambling King he no Michi", "overview": "Ippatsu Gyakuten is a gambling simulation game with a strong story element. A young man whose father was a famous gambler dreams of following the same path, and decides to become the greatest gambler in Japan. To that end, the player can bet on horse, boat, and cycling races, as well as play pachinko and pachislot (slot machines), with the ultimate goal of earning 1 billion yen in winnings. In addition to gambling, the player can also take part-time jobs to earn some extra cash, and even meet girls and go on dates. In addition to the main story mode, there is also a free mode where each of the gambling activities can be played without any of the time or money restrictions of the story mode. The later PlayStation version has a different title and removes pachinko from the available games, but is otherwise the same game.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "July 5, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Planning Office Wada", "publishers": "Planning Office Wada", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/107047-ippatsu-gyakuten-gambling-king-he-no-michi\n"}
