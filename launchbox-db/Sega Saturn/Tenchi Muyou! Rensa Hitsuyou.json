{"altername_name": ["Tenchi Muy\u014d!: Rensa Hitsuy\u014d"], "name": "Tenchi Muyou! Rensa Hitsuyou", "overview": "Tenchi and his friends are having a karaoke party! But Ryoko is hogging the mic and not giving anyone else a turn, and Ayeka is fed up with her hogging the spotlight. Washu suggests a game to decide who gets to sing next, but it's not nearly as simple as a game of janken... Tenchi Muyou! Rensa Hitsuyou is a competitive falling-block puzzle game based on the Tenchi Muyo! anime series, similar to the popular Puyo Puyo series. Pairs of blocks in various colors fall into the playfield, and the player must arrange them; if three or more of the same color are matched together, they will vanish from the playfield and allow blocks above them to fall into their place and potentially trigger combo chains. Combo chains will cause the water level in the opponent's playfield to rise; blocks cannot be dropped below the water line, and if either the blocks or the water reach the top of the playfield that player loses the match. Several other special blocks also appear on occasion: Heart blocks will lower the water level when matched, Anchor blocks will push any blocks below them down into the water, and Ryo-oki blocks will trigger the selected character's special move when matched. The game includes a single-player story mode, a two-player battle mode, and a free battle mode against the CPU, as well as a tutorial that explains the game rules. There are six playable characters, all of them the girls from the show; Tenchi himself is not playable.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "February 28, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Access", "publishers": "Pioneer", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/91444-tenchi-muyou-rensa-hitsuyou\n"}
