{"altername_name": [], "name": "Goiken Muyou: Anarchy in the Nippon", "overview": "Goiken Muyou: Anarchy in the Nippon is a 3D fighting game in the vein of Virtua Fighter (it must be noted that this game was developed by ex-AM2, VF2 staff). Thus, similarly to VF series, there's no fireballs or other special attacks of that kind. But, unlike VF, there's no jump button, even if there's the possibility to jump over opponents for additional damage when they're on the ground. Also, a side-step dodge through the L and R buttons can be done, showing that the game also uses a 3D gameplay. The game features a cast of 13 characters, 4 of them being the programmers themselves. The game modes available are varied: the classical arcade mode, a 1-round survival mode, a tournament against the CPU or against human opponents, spectator mode, training mode and there's also a character customization mode. All menu options, character names, etc. are in Japanese.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "October 2, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "KSS", "publishers": "KSS", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5TlUoXdHZI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90855-goiken-muyou-anarchy-in-the-nippon\n"}
