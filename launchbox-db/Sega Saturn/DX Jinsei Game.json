{"altername_name": ["Game of Life, The: DX Jinsei Game"], "name": "DX Jinsei Game", "overview": "DX Jinsei Game is a multiplayer party board game based on The Game of Life board game by Milton Bradley. The game features similar rules to the board game, though it is not a direct translation. Two to four players take turns spinning a roulette wheel to move forward on the board, and each space features various events; some will raise or lower the player's stats, some will allow the player to earn money, some are special events such as a first date or getting into college, and some contain mini-games. As the game progresses, each player progresses from high school through college, marriage, a career, starting a family, and finally retirement. The game ends once all players have reached the goal at the end of the map, and the player with the most money saved up is the winner. The game offers three different courses, up to three computer-controlled opponents, and the ability to customize each player's avatar. Each of the courses is divided up into multiple smaller themed sections, some of which are shared between the courses. Optionally, a friendly angel character will offer advice about how the game works as new events occur.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "December 15, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kid", "publishers": "Takara", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/107004-dx-jinsei-game\n"}
