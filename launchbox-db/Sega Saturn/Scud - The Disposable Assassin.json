{"altername_name": [], "name": "Scud: The Disposable Assassin", "overview": "You play the game as Scud, a \"disposable assassin\", who has been hired to take out a target in the \"Marvin's Manikan\" factory. Based on the underground comic by Rob Schrab, Scuds are designed to self destruct after they have destroyed their target... Scud has become aware of this fact, and instead only injures his target enough to not self-destruct. But, being a robot, Scud has no money, and must turn to freelance jobs to pay for his original target's life support. The game can be played with either a controller or the Virtua Stunner (or other compatible light gun). With a controller, the game is a side scrolling shoot-em-up; but with a light gun, it becomes a first person shooter. You can play with any combination of controllers and guns, but the game is essentially meant to be played with two guns (Scud himself uses two guns). The game is fueled by music from \"DJR/IB3 LTD.\" (Darryl J. Reavis & Illuminado Berrios, III), Fidget-X, and Unbelievable Jolly Machine", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "February 28, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Syrox Developments", "publishers": "SegaSoft", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.44", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scud:_The_Disposable_Assassin_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJDd0azZY_g", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/10903-scud-the-disposable-assassin\n"}
