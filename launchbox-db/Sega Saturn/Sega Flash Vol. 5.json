{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sega Flash Vol. 5", "overview": "Sega Flash Vol. 5 is the fifth demo disc in the Sega Flash series. It was released in mid-1997 and features four playable demos; Sonic Jam, Die Hard Arcade, Sonic 3D: Flickies' Island and Sega Rally Championship, as videos containing previews of seven other games. Much of the content is recycled from Sega Flash Vol. 1 and Sega Flash Vol. 4 - the only \"new\" demo is Sonic Jam, which allows players to play through the first stages of Sonic the Hedgehog and Sonic the Hedgehog 2, as well as a reduced section of Sonic World. As the game had not yet been released in Europe at the time, the game uses Japanese art for its cartridges (the cut-off screen is in Japanese too). All of the extra features are inaccessible. In the United Kingdom this was released with issue #23 of Sega Saturn Magazine. It was also distributed with consoles. Playable Demos included: Die Hard Arcade Sega Rally Championship Sonic 3D: Flickies' Island Sonic Jam Videos included: Dragon Force Duke Nukem 3D Enemy Zero Last Bronx NBA Action '98 Resident Evil Sega Touring Car Championship Wipeout 2097", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "September 1, 1997", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Sega Enterprises", "publishers": "Sega Enterprises", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133609-sega-flash-vol-5\n"}
