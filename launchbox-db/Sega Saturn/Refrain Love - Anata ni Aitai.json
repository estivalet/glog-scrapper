{"altername_name": [], "name": "Refrain Love: Anata ni Aitai", "overview": "Refrain Love is a dating simulation adventure game and a story of seven men and women, including the player. The protagonist is a male college student (character's name is not pre-defined, but entered by the player) who made a vow with couple of his friends, Tetsuya Yamo, Kousuke Satou, and Taizou Sakaki, to find a woman by next Christmas. One day, you meet a girl that looks like a dead ringer of the mysterious woman that's been plaguing your dreams recently. Chance, fate, or just dumb luck, it makes you feel like you just might have a chance to make your wish come true. The game's story follows the events in the year and ends on the Christmas Eve, hopefully with the girl of your dreams right by your side. Two main gameplay modes in the game are simulation and adventure mode. Adventure mode is similar to visual novels but with much more choices to select during conversations with your buddies or the girl you're on a date with. Additionally, you can use the city map to visit various different locations. The simulation mode consists of part-time job where you get to earn some money, spending time alone with a hobby of your choice, playing with your friends, or taking a girl to a date. The obvious girl of your choice features Tomomi Sakura, the girl from your campus, Ran Yuuki, your childhood friend, and Shouko Takamiya, a working woman.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "March 14, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Riverhill Soft", "publishers": "Hamster", "genres": "Life Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/68242-refrain-love-anata-ni-aitai\n"}
