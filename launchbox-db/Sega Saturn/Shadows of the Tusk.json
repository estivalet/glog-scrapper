{"altername_name": [], "name": "Shadows of the Tusk", "overview": "Shadows of the Tusk is a turn-based strategy game where a player can build a party consisting of characters recruited in various ways which serves as their \"deck\". It utlized Seganet's X-band system to allow players to compete online, which was fairly unique for a console of the era. Local play with a friend is also possible (fortunately!) A terrible dragon was slain by the great knight and future King, Richard Rosewall. But the dragon cursed the land and the Rosewall family with its dying breath, and on the 18th birthday of Richard's daughter Rebecca a horrible fiend was born from one of the dragon's remaining teeth... Tusker! Tusker begins to manipulate space-time to merge many possible futures and recruit a huge army of ghouls and monsters from all time periods to destroy the world! It's up to Richard to once again don his armor and recruit a new army and destroy Tusker before it's too late.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "May 21, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Digital Media Lab", "publishers": "Hudson Soft", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/91065-shadows-of-the-tusk\n"}
