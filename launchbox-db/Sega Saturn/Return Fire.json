{"altername_name": [], "name": "Return Fire", "overview": "Return Fire is an unreleased Sega Saturn game, ported from the Panasonic 3DO. It is a top-down 2.5D action game, in which you control a variety of vehicles and shoot enemies. The Saturn version of the game was completed and was ready for release, but complications arose. Hitachi, manufacturers of the HiSaturn, noted that the game did not run correctly on their variant of the console, leaving the developers (Prolific) waiting for a HiSaturn console to test the game on. After this setback the game's publisher, Williams Entertainment, decided to avoid publishing games for the Saturn, and hence the project was effectively scrapped. Other versions of the game were released, however, including a version for the PlayStation. The full Saturn version of the game was leaked onto the internet in 2007. It was also reviewed by several publications at the time and given a relatively high score. A Sega 32X version was also planned at one point, and was mentioned in Mean Machines Sega #31.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "January 1, 1997", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.88", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/10898-return-fire\n"}
