{"altername_name": [], "name": "Savaki", "overview": "Here's an interesting game. A 3D martial arts fighter made by an unknown company near the end of the Saturn's life in Japan, released in April 1998 the same year the Dreamcast was released. Savaki is visually a pleasant surprise with it's 60 fps animation, real time shading, light sourcing, shadow reflextions and 3D arena. It even plays very well indeed. There are a vast array of different fighting types to choose from too. Karate, Taekwon Do, Muetai, Jeet Kun Do, Dentou Karate, Boxing and of course Free Style for those big fat thugs without any real skill. The only down side to Savaki is that there is only one background arena. Surely it wouldn't have hurt the programmers to add a few more. Still, overall Savaki is a very nice fighter for those who like a little more skill involved in their games.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "April 16, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Cynus", "publishers": "Microcabin", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNszJ_7H1FA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/91051-savaki\n"}
