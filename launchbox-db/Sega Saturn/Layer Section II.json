Although there is no story connection, it is often thought of as the spiritual successor to RayForce, which had similar gameplay. You have 2 weapons at you disposal, a vulcan gun and a lock-on missile attack. You can also do 2 special attacks by using the lock-on system in a special way. The graphics are all in 3D, but the gameplay mechanics are in 2D. There are 7 stages, each ending with a giant end boss.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "October 30, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Taito", "publishers": "Media Quest", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.78", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/11359-layer-section-ii\n"}
