{"altername_name": [], "name": "Yellow Brick Road", "overview": "Yellow Brick Road (\u30a4\u30a8\u30ed\u30fc\u30fb\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u30fb\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9) is an adventure game based on the book, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. Inspired by the Oz Books by L. Frank Baum, Yellow Brick Road concerns the player's attempt to thwart an invasion of the Emerald City by the Gnome King. Along the way s/he teams up with the tin man, lion, and eventually the scarecrow. Besides these, other recognizable figures from the books include Jack Pumpkinhead, the little Wizard of Oz, and Glinda, who, in the game, is queen of Oz. The game's structure is reminiscent of first-person adventures: the player interacts with the environment and manipulates inventory items to proceed. The puzzles, however, are kept to a minimum, since combat occupies a significant portion of the game, effectively turning it into a hybrid of adventure and small-scale real-time strategy.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "August 30, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Synergy", "publishers": "Acclaim Entertainment", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/33418-yellow-brick-road\n"}
