{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pappara Paoon", "overview": "Pappara Paoon is a competitive color-matching puzzle game. Two players at opposite ends of a playfield launch colored pieces at a group of blocks; if four or more pieces of the same color are matched, all connected pieces of the same color are removed from play. Certain pieces will place garbage pieces on the opposing player's side of the board or shift the entire playfield in one direction, and if the pieces reach all the way to one end of the playfield, that player loses. The game includes both a single-player campaign mode and a two-player versus mode.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "November 22, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ecole Software", "publishers": "Ecole Software", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/91006-pappara-paoon\n"}
