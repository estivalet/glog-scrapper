{"altername_name": [], "name": "Kyuukyoku Tiger II Plus", "overview": "Kyuukyoku Tiger II Plus (\u7a76\u6975\u30bf\u30a4\u30ac\u30fc\u2161\u30d7\u30e9\u30b9) is a vertical scrolling shoot-'em-up game released exclusively in Japan for the Sega Saturn in 1997. It is a sequel to Kyuukyoku Tiger, otherwise known as Twin Cobra. The game was initially released in arcades in 1995 as Kyuukyoku Tiger II (Twin Cobra II outside of Japan), and can be seen as the \"last\" shoot-'em-up to be developed by employees of the now-defunct Toaplan. Toaplan folded before the game was complete, but Taito who held the rights to the Tiger Heli series, allowed the game to be finished by Takumi Corporation, a company made up of former Toaplan members which formed shortly before Toaplan's closure. Naxat Soft were responsible for bringing the game to the Saturn, adding Plus to the title as well as CGI cutscenes, a new soundtrack, some palette changes and an extra level.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "December 18, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "NAXAT Soft", "publishers": "Naxat Soft", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.69", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90904-kyuukyoku-tiger-ii-plus\n"}
