{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hissatsu!", "overview": "Three men and a cowboy plot to assassinate tyrannical criminals in the old days of Japan. They go around at night, kill people, and sometimes have to fight something really weird like a magic monster. There are hand drawn art pieces that accompany the story between levels, but for the most part, you can ignore them. Plot really isn\u2019t that important in a game like Hissatasu. It\u2019s more about the action than anything. Hissatsu\u2019s sprites are all in live action, but it\u2019s background are all hand drawn sprites. The effect ends up being very surreal, like you\u2019ve got live action people walking around in a cartoon world. It doesn\u2019t help that all of the special effects use sprites, which only compounds the weirdness. The music is good, but very quiet. I guess it makes sense, as you\u2019re walking around at night and killing people, sometimes without them even knowing. Sometimes the tracks get intense, but it\u2019s usually because something really cool is about to happen, like a boss fight or some kind of supernatural enemy is appearing.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "June 28, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Emotion Digital Software", "publishers": "Bandai Visual", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90863-hissatsu\n"}
