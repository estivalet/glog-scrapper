{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tetris S", "overview": "Tetris S is a puzzle game developed by Bullet-Proof Software for the Sega Saturn. It is a variation of Tetris made specifically for the Sega Saturn system, compared to Tetris Plus which was an arcade port. During development it was known as BPS Puzzle, possibly until the Tetris license could be secured. Compared to other versions of the game within and before this timeframe, Tetris S is a fairly bare-bones Tetris package, as there's only a one-player mode and a two-player mode (against either a human or a computer opponent). Unlike BPS's normal Tetris works, this game is aesthetically themed after Sega's 1988 arcade Tetris.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "December 27, 1996", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Bullet-Proof Software", "publishers": "Bullet-Proof Software", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVYu2XdB5L0&ab_channel=SegaStation", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78334-tetris-s\n"}
