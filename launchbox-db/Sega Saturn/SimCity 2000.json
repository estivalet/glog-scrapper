{"altername_name": [], "name": "SimCity 2000", "overview": "SimCity 2000 is a strategy/simulation game developed and published by Maxis as a sequel to SimCity. It is the only SimCity game to be released on a Sega console, in this case, the Sega Saturn in 1995. SimCity 2000 brought isometric graphics to the table, allowing the user to fully customize the terrain of the level before begging. Again, the main goal is to build successful cities while negotiating natural disasters. The Saturn version retains most of the content from the PC version, though is missing some of the disaster scenarios for unknown reasons. It is also a slower game, with longer load times and the fastest speed setting of the PC version removed. The game includes a CD soundtrack with higher quality sound effects than previous releases.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "September 29, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Maxis", "publishers": "Maxis", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.57", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimCity_2000", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjJBstLafak", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/10920-simcity-2000\n"}
