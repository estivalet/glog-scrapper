{"altername_name": [], "name": "Saturn Bomberman for SegaNet", "overview": "This special release of Saturn Bomberman is modified to exclusively support online play via the Sega Saturn Modem and XBand service, a feature which was not present in the original Japanese release of the game. The gameplay is identical to the regular version, but normal mode is not present and battle mode is restricted to online play only. If the game does not detect a modem peripheral, it boots into a simplified single-player \"Master Game\" mode with a single stage that gives the player a ranking at the end.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "September 27, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hudson Soft", "publishers": "Hudson Soft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.6", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148721-saturn-bomberman-for-seganet\n"}
