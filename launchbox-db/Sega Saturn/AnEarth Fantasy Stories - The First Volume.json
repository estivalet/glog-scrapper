The differences between this release and the original version are: The graphics are higher resolution and are generally brighter and crisper. Anime-style portraits during conversations have been re-drawn completely and have a different style. There is voice acting for all important conversations, not just for some of them, as in the original version. There are new story-related sequences that were not present in the Turbo CD release. Battle animations are somewhat smoother. Location of certain items has been altered. More items have been added. The anime-style cut scenes of the original version are gone. They are replaced by cut scenes done with in-game graphics.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "March 28, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Media Works", "publishers": "Hudson Soft", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.12", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGzh3ln1kqc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/31277-anearth-fantasy-stories-the-first-volume\n"}
