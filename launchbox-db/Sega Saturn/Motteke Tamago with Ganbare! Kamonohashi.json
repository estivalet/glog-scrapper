Turns out it won't be that easy since a duck picks up the eggs so they have to fight over who owns the eggs. After defeating the duck the eggs keep rolling off to another animal over and over again. Will they ever return home? Playing as one of a cast of cute characters the player will move around a arena collecting eggs and dash attacking into opponents. The dash attack will cause the opponent to drop all their eggs. After picking them up the eggs will hatch after a short time which will then require the player to get them back to the nest which will give the player points. Whoever has the most points after 3 rounds will be declared the winner.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "July 2, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "NAXAT Soft", "publishers": "Naxat Soft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90993-motteke-tamago-with-ganbare-kamonohashi\n"}
