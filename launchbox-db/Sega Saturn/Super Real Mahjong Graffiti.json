This means it includes Super Real Mahjong PII, Super Real Mahjong PIII, and Super Real Mahjong PIV. They are not straight ports, however, as there have been some changes, such as improved graphics to the earlier games. There are six girls to challenge to strip mahjong. Strip sequences are animated.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "November 24, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "SETA", "publishers": "SETA", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/91438-super-real-mahjong-graffiti\n"}
