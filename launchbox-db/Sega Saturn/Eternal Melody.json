{"altername_name": [], "name": "Eternal Melody", "overview": "A regular young man is on his way home from school one day, and decides to take a shortcut through a construction site. Looking up, he sees a large steel beam hanging precariously... and then it suddenly falls straight down onto him! Fully ready in that moment to die, he instead finds himself in an unfamiliar world. He soon meets a fairy named Filly and a bard named Roxane, and is told that the only way to return home to his own world is with a special magic said to grant any wish; to find that magic, he'll need Filly's help to gather a group of companions. The two of them immediately set off to the nearest town to start their adventure... Eternal Melody is a simulation adventure game similar to the better-known Y\u016bky\u016b Gens\u014dkyoku by the same developers. The main thrust of the game is to assemble a team of four party members and manage their schedules so as to improve their abilities and the protagonist's relationship with them. There are also occasional battles as the party travels, though the outcome is determined by dice rolls based on the party's stats rather than being controlled directly. There are a total of 12 characters to recruit \u2014 9 romantic interests and 3 rivals \u2014 and more than two dozen possible endings depending on the player's actions.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "October 4, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Starlight Marry", "publishers": "MediaWorks", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/107012-eternal-melody\n"}
