{"altername_name": ["Gekirindan"], "name": "Gekirindan: Time Travel Shooting", "overview": "Gekirindan Time Travel Shooting (\u9006\u9c57\u5f3e \u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u30c8\u30e9\u30d9\u30eb\u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0) is a 1995 arcade shoot-'em-up by Taito ported to the Sega Saturn in 1997 by Virgin. The Saturn port was only released in Japan. Soundtrack was composed by Taito\u2019s house band Zuntata. Gekirindan game appears to be a hommage to competitor Toaplan. Enemies, player ships etc. display many similarities, e.g. Type A\u2019s bomb closely resembles the skull bomb in Tatsujin, Type C\u2019s alternative shot is similar to the green shot in Flying Shark. The story involves time travel, with the heroes following the villain through their period (future from our perspective), world war period, present, and two future periods. Three ship types, titled Type A, B and C are available. Depending on player 1 and 2 side, the pilot also looks different. In typical shooting game manner, there is one button for firing and one for bombs. Bombs are very strong and destroy most standard enemies and bullets instantly. Power ups increase shot strength and add extra weapons: Homing, Laser and Napalm, with the latter being the objectively best weapon in the game. The game adds score based on collected medals and remaining bombs at the end of each stage.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "April 18, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Japan Media Programming", "publishers": "Virgin Interactive Entertainment", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.84", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gekirindan", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90853-gekirindan-time-travel-shooting\n"}
