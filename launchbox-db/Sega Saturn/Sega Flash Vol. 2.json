{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sega Flash Vol. 2", "overview": "Sega Flash Vol. 2 is the second demo disc in the Sega Flash series. Vol. 2 contains five playable demos, although Baku Baku Animal's demo is lifted from Sega Flash Vol. 1. The NiGHTS into Dreams demo is the most expansive, allowing playthroughs of both Claris' and Elliot's first stages (and boss fights). Sega Worldwide Soccer '97 allows for one exibition match (or half of one) between any country in-game - there are many subtle changes from the final version, including a different title screen, spelling errors, a lack of commentary and an outdated flag for South Africa (the demo uses the pre-1994 variant). Athlete Kings allows for a quick playthrough of its main events and Panzer Dragoon Zwei lets players fly through episode three. In a presumed effort to save space, the videos of Virtua Fighter Kids, The Story of Thor 2, Three Dirty Dwarves and Exhumed are compiled together in a low-resolution clip shown with borders. In the United Kingdom this was released with issue #12 of Sega Saturn Magazine.
