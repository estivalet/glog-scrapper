{"altername_name": [], "name": "Angelique Duet", "overview": "Angelique Duet is a spin-off of the first Angelique. It offers players the ability to play as Rosalie, the rival of the first game. The gameplay and flow remains much the same to the first game if the player picks Angelique, but has altered romance events for Rosalie to distinguish it from the base game. It also includes features and events that were added in Angelique Special 2, such as the gift giving and written date invitations. On top of that there are now Friendship events between Angelique and Rosalie. There is also a change in character portraits and backgrounds as they received a graphical update.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "July 30, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Koei", "publishers": "Koei", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.2", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelique_(video_game_series)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/31281-angelique-duet\n"}
