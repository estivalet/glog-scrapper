{"altername_name": ["GubBlaze-S"], "name": "GunBlaze S", "overview": "GunBlaze S is a remake of GunBlaze. The story remains the same as in the original game, and the dialogues almost the same, with a few minor omissions. The gameplay is also largely unchanged. The main difference between the two versions is in the graphics. Many locations and cut scenes in GunBlaze S were re-drawn from scratch. Some of the locations have different layout. Generally, the graphics are clearly more detailed, even though they retain the simple 2D top-down style of the original. There are voice-overs for all story-related dialogues in this version. There is also another significant change: the original GunBlaze had scenes with nudity; GunBlaze S has none. The sexual innuendo is present in the dialogues, and there are scenes with scantily clad young girls; but the adult content is gone.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "January 29, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Active Software", "publishers": "KID", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/131036-gunblaze-s\n"}
