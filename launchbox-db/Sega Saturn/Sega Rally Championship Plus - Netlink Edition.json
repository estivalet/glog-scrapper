{"altername_name": ["Sega Rally Championship Plus", "Sega Rally Championship Plus: Netlink Edition"], "name": "Sega Rally Championship Plus: Netlink Edition", "overview": "Sega Rally was a major success in the arcades, bringing rally-style racing to the masses before the Colin McRae games. Four detailed tracks have been created, with a succession of stomach-churning bends and jumps, and you can choose from 3 different cars. As well as the main championship, there is a time-trial mode featuring a ghost car to beat, so you always know how your run compares with your best-ever. Two machines can be linked for multi-player action. The handling of the cars is unrealistic, to put the focus on action and instant playability.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "May 1, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Sega AM5", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.62", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Rally_Championship", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75589-sega-rally-championship-plus-netlink-edition\n"}
