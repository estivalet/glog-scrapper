This involves travelling through a set of precarious tunnels in your high-tech hover-craft. The tunnels are filled with enemy vehicles, choppers and sentry guns which you have to take out or avoid. To make life even worse, a lot of sections require you to clear them in a given time limit. The only good thing is that you'll be able to upgrade your weaponry often.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "January 15, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "NEON Software", "publishers": "Acclaim Entertainment", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/10940-tunnel-b1\n"}
