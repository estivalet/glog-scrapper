{"altername_name": ["Sega Ages Volume 1"], "name": "Sega Ages", "overview": "Sega Ages: Volume 1, known simply as Sega Ages in North America, and not to be confused with the similarly named collection released only in Japan, is a video game compilation for the Sega Saturn. It was only released in western regions, with Sega publishing the game in Europe and Working Designs in North America. Sega Ages: Volume 1 contains three games previously released in Japan as stand-alone titles; Sega Ages Vol.2 Space Harrier, Sega Ages OutRun and Sega Ages After Burner II, being enhanced ports of the arcade classics Space Harrier, OutRun and After Burner II, respectively. Though Sega produced ten more entries in its Sega Ages series on the Saturn, all were exclusive to Japan. Despite its title, Sega did not release a \"Volume 2\", nor did the company explicitly acknowledge development of such a compilation. All three games in Sega Ages: Volume 1 are identical to their stand-alone Saturn counterparts, which are in turn extremely similar to the arcade originals. All offer extra difficulty options.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "November 6, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Rutubo Games", "publishers": "Sega Enterprises", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.06", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Ages#Sega_Ages_(Sega_Saturn)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6kDUifB4eg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/51120-sega-ages\n"}
