{"altername_name": [], "name": "Street Fighter II Movie", "overview": "The player takes control of one of Shadaloo's Cyborgs, and is given the mission to record data on fighters from around the world. The gameplay consists of watching FMV clips from the actual movie and analyzing them using the \"search\" command. On each stage, the player has a limited amount of time to analyze their surrounding as much as possible in order to gather the most data. The player can take pictures, and if he does so when characters are fighting, it enhances the Cyborg's power. Several battles from the movie are included, as well as some extra animated scenes exclusive to this game.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "March 15, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Capcom", "publishers": "Capcom", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.23", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_Fighter_II:_The_Animated_Movie#Video_game", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze6liE_rXYE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/87919-street-fighter-ii-movie\n"}
