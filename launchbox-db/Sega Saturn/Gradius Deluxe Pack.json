{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gradius Deluxe Pack", "overview": "Gradius Deluxe Pack is a compilation of both Gradius and Gradius II - two arcade shoot-'em-ups developed and published by Konami. It remains to this day the only Gradius release on a Sega system (in this case, the Sega Saturn), though there have been several Parodius games (which parody Gradius) and Salamander Deluxe Pack Plus (a Gradius spin-off) also saw a release on the Saturn. The game sadly never left Japan. The games are identical to their arcade counterparts, bar a few touch-ups.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "March 29, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.05", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradius_Deluxe_Pack", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/85301-gradius-deluxe-pack\n"}
