{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gale Racer", "overview": "Rad Mobile, known as Gale Racer (\u30b2\u30a4\u30eb\u30ec\u30fc\u30b5\u30fc) for the Sega Saturn port, is an arcade racing game which was released in 1990 using the Sega System 32 platform. It was Sega's first System 32 game and is also the first game which Sonic the Hedgehog appeared in. Rad Mobile takes place in the first person perspective. The race is a speed race across the USA where the player is limited by time, Police on Certain stages, and weather effects. The game was very advanced for the time as the player had to interact by pressing buttons to activate the Widow screen wipers on the car and the headlights depending on the current stage. The Difficulty and speed of Police and Rival cars is determined by the dip switch settings and the settings in the service menu.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "December 2, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega Enterprises", "publishers": "Sega Enterprises", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.39", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90850-gale-racer\n"}
