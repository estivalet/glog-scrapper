{"altername_name": ["Eternal Champions: The Final Battle"], "name": "Eternal Champions: The Final Chapter", "overview": "Eternal Champions: The Final Chapter was an unreleased game planned for the Sega Saturn by the former member of Sega of America, Michael Latham. The game only made it past the first 20 pages of concept art before being forcefully canceled by Sega of Japan, seeing the game as competition for the Saturn version of AM2's Virtua Fighter. The Final Champter likely would have contained a second set of fighters fighting to regain their lives (called the Infernals), creating a balance to the timeline. A third force, called Chaos, would threaten the timeline and the two sides have to work together fight this new threat. Depending on your actions, the timeline would change, affecting the looks, abilities and histories of the characters in play. There were thirty planned possible endings. While this third Eternal Champions game made it far into development before being axed, it is advertised on the box of early North American Sega Saturns for a release in Autumn 1995. According to Michael Latham, there was a Sega Saturn demo made demonstrating some of the fighting. Word of its cancellation did not reach the gaming press until the first half of 1996.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161316-eternal-champions-the-final-chapter\n"}
