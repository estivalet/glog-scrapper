{"altername_name": [], "name": "3D Lemmings", "overview": "There is no actual narrative to the game. The only introduction is a movie. It shows a completely flat (2D) lemming popping out of a computer's floppy drive, and finding a \"3D\" button to press, which makes him 3-dimensional. After that, the PC blows up and the (now 3D) lemmings inside it escape. Other movies play after completing each set of 20 levels, but are not connected by a storyline.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "August 23, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Clockwork Games", "publishers": "Imageneer", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.84", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_Lemmings", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/5248-3d-lemmings\n"}
