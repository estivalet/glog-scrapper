{"altername_name": ["Jinzou Ningen Hakaider: Last Judgement"], "name": "Mechanical Violator Hakaider: Last Judgement", "overview": "Mechanical Violator Hakaider: Last Judgement is a CD-ROM video game for the Sega Saturn. It is a sequel to the 1995 film, Mechanical Violator Hakaider. The game's story was written by Toshiki Inoue, the director of the original film. 10 years after the events of the film, Jesus Town is attacked by a robot named Waruder and Hakaider is defeated. Disgraced, Hakaider retreats and repairs himself and ventures back to Jesus Town to reclaim his right arm and save the city. The player must battle futuristic versions of DARK robots while trying to liberate Jesus Town from the evil Blue Hakaider and the A.I. program known as Gil. The game is a basic arcade-style on-rail shooter game, where the player must destroy all targets on screen to progress. The game grades points to the player based on accuracy and the total percentage of enemies hit. The weapon of the game is the Hakaider Shot (which is controlled by the Sega Virtua Gun or the Shuttle Mouse), which can be equipped with four different types of ammo which can be reloaded at different rates, so players must select carefully which ammo to use in a firefight. The game also has exploration areas inbetween where the player can buy upgrades in shops or do tasks to trigger the next part of the story.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "December 27, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Japan Media Programming", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90883-mechanical-violator-hakaider-last-judgement\n"}
