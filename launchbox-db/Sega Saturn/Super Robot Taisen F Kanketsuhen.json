F and F Final were originally thought as an unique game, but production delays made the producers decide to split the game in two parts. This game features the first appearance of Mazinkaiser (created by contaminating the Mazinger Z with Getter rays). Gameplay mechanics are the same of Super Robot Wars 4 (and Super Robot Wars F, of course). It's a turn strategy game, when attacked the player can decide to counter, to dodge (halves the % of being hit) and to defend (it halves the damage eventually received).", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "April 23, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Winky Soft", "publishers": "Banpresto", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/107219-super-robot-taisen-f-kanketsuhen\n"}
