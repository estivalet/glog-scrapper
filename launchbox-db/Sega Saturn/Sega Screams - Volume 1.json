{"altername_name": ["Sega Saturn Bootleg II: On the Road"], "name": "Sega Screams: Volume 1", "overview": "Sega Screams Volume 1 is a demo disc for the Sega Saturn, released exclusively in North America with console bundles. Bizarrely Sega of America released this game twice - initially as Sega Saturn Bootleg II (as a \"sequel\" to Bootleg Sampler). The product in its Bootleg II form is far less common, though aside from a changed title screen (on some discs), the two discs are identical. Unlike Bootleg Sampler, Sega Screams Volume 1 opts for the \"standard\" Saturn demo disc menus often seen in the European Sega Flash series. Sega Screams Volume 1 was followed by Sega Screams Volume 2.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "February 1, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVXDDNJvPD0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/132528-sega-screams-volume-1\n"}
