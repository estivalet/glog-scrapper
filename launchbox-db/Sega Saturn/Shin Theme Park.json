It is a largely undocumented variant of Theme Park, presumably tweaked to make it appeal more towards the Japanese market. At its core, it appears to be the same game, though the introduction sequence has been replaced, and big chunks of the visuals were redrawn.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "April 11, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Electronic Arts Victor", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "https://segaretro.org/Shin_Theme_Park", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/129156-shin-theme-park\n"}
