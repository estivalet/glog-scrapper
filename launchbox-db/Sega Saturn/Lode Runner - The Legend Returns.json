It is the first of several titles to be developed by Presage Software, others being Lode Runner Extra, Lode Runner On-Line: The Mad Monks' Revenge and Lode Runner 2. Initially released for DOS/Windows PCs and Macintosh computers in 1994, it was ported to the Sega Saturn in 1996 and published by Patra in Japan. Unlike previous sequels to Lode Runner (such as Championship Lode Runner), The Legend Returns extends the basic formula of the first game by adding a variety of new tools such as drills and bombs, as well as teleporters. It retains the level editor, but also adds support for two players. The Saturn version of Lode Runner: The Legend Retruns was not released outside of Japan.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "March 8, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Presage Software", "publishers": "Patra", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "2.88", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90981-lode-runner-the-legend-returns\n"}
