{"altername_name": [], "name": "Magical Night Dreams: Cotton 2", "overview": "A direct sequel to the original Cotton and virtually an arcade-perfect port of the version for the Sega Titan Video arcade hardware. This game marks the introduction of two new primary characters: Appli, a young princess, and her anthropomorphic hat, Needle. Cotton 2 sees a return to traditional horizontal scrolling in the series, but it also stands out among shoot-'em-ups in general for its unique gameplay system. With a heavy incorporation of Newtonian physics, Cotton 2 ultimately mixes elements of 2D platformers with traditional shoot 'em up gameplay. The first release of this game also included a mini-calendar for 1998 and a special edition included a Cotton themed teacup.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "December 4, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Success", "publishers": "Success", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.02", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_2:_Magical_Night_Dreams", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD10gFW7wQw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/22881-magical-night-dreams-cotton-2\n"}
