{"altername_name": ["Bug! Jump Shite, Funzukechatte, Petchanko"], "name": "Bug!", "overview": "Bug! was played like a traditional side-scrolling adventure game. In the same fashion as Sonic the Hedgehog (in one level Bug must race against Sonic), Bug must jump and stomp on the heads of his enemies to defeat them while making his way through large levels and collecting power-ups. What sets Bug! apart is the game's 3D levels, which take the side-view and tweak it. Bug can walk sidewise up vertical surfaces and even upside down. Each set of levels (ranging from a bright, green grassy area to a deep red, desert level) has a deeply individual look and feel.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "December 8, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Realtime Associates", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.30", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bug!", "video_link": "https://youtube.com/watch?v=dJVzyr8NT1A", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/9597-bug\n"}
