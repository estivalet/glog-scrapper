{"altername_name": ["Independence Day: The Game"], "name": "Independence Day", "overview": "This arcade game is based loosely on the 1996 blockbuster movie \"Independence Day.\" Interspersed with cutscenes lifted from the film, the game consists of flying a jet through various missions in order to take down the gargantuan, city-destroying spaceships. This entails flying around the 3D level and taking out targets such as: communication uplinks, shield generators, the occasional alien fighter craft, and ultimately bringing down the major alien ship via a strike on its main cannon. Powerups are plentiful, such as medical packs that heal your jetcraft, bonus weapons, bonus planes, and an item that freezes enemy planes for a brief time. Mission settings include the Grand Canyon, Washington D.C., and New York City. There are other missions that are provided on a need-to-know basis (as stated in the manual). The game also features 2-player head-to-head action via a network or null modem link.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "March 13, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Radical Entertainment", "publishers": "Fox Interactive", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.04", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/10857-independence-day\n"}
