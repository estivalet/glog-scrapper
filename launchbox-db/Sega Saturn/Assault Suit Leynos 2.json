{"altername_name": ["Juusou Kihei Leynos 2"], "name": "Assault Suit Leynos 2", "overview": "Japan-only sequel to Target Earth, Leynos 2 puts you in the cockpit of a giant mecha robot as you scroll and shoot your way through a series of 7 individual missions tied loosely together by a generic sci-fi plot. The game itself plays as a side-scrolling shooter set in different planets as well as outer space (where you can fly anywhere with your jump-jets). You have a variety of upgradeable weaponry which allow you to shoot anywhere on-screen as well as auto-lock individual enemies, and depending on how well you do on each stage you get a specific rating score that allows you to upgrade and customize your mech.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "February 21, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "NCS", "publishers": "Masaya", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault_Suit_Leynos_2", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/8852-assault-suit-leynos-2\n"}
