{"altername_name": ["Death Throttle: Kakuzetsu Toshi Kara no Dasshutsu", "Quarantine"], "name": "Death Throttle", "overview": "Death Throttle: Kakuzetsu Toshi kara no Dasshutsu (\u30c7\u30b9\u30b9\u30ed\u30c3\u30c8\u30eb \u9694\u7d76\u90fd\u5e02\u304b\u3089\u306e\u8131\u51fa) is a first-person vehicular combat game for the Sega Saturn, released exclusively in Japan in 1996. It was originally released as Quarantine for DOS computers and the 3DO in 1994. The PlayStation release, handled by Asmik, is called Hard Rock Cab and is almost identical to this version (though is censored with green blood as opposed to red). Death Throttle is similar to Crazy Taxi, with the player driving a taxi and moving people to and from various locations on the map. However, due to its age, the game is played on a flat surface similar in nature to Wolfenstein 3D. The taxi is equipped with guns, allowing you to shoot other vehicles. It is also possible to run over pedestrians, similar to the Grand Theft Auto or Carmageddon franchises. The Saturn version of the game (much like its PlayStation counterpart) sports improved lighting and more detailed textures, but has a lower frame rate than the PC original. Essential text has also been translated into Japanese (though live action cutscenes and non-essential features remain in English). Quarantine/Death Throttle was followed by the PC game Road Warrior, released in 1995.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "July 12, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Infini Entertainment Technology", "publishers": "MediaQuest", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90735-death-throttle\n"}
