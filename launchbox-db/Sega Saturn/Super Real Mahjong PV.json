{"altername_name": ["Super Real Mahjong PV", "Super Real Mahjong P.V"], "name": "Super Real Mahjong PV", "overview": "Super Real Mahjong PV is the fifth installment in the strip mahjong series. There is no background story in the game; the player is merely introduced to three high school girls - Mizuki, Aya, and Akira - who challenge him to the game of mahjong. The main mahjong mode is that of the one-on-one variety; after each successfully completed round the girl removes a part of her clothing. The computer versions of the game contain scenes with nudity; among the console versions, the PC-FX one is the only one that similarly lacks censorship. Some of the versions have secondary gameplay modes, such as a team mode in which the player controls three girls and plays mahjong against three others.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "May 26, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "SETA", "publishers": "SETA", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/91440-super-real-mahjong-pv\n"}
