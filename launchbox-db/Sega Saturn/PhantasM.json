{"altername_name": ["Phantasmagoria"], "name": "PhantasM", "overview": "Phantasm is an adventure game originally released for Windows PC's (as Phantasmagoria in the western world). It was later ported to the Sega Saturn and released exclusively in Japan. Phantasm is notable for shipping on 8 Saturn discs (one more than the PC version) - more than any other game in the console's library. This is because the game relies heavily on full motion video. I feel its presence, the icy fingers upon my throat. I hear its eerie sounds, unsettling my every thought. I try in vain to slumber, my reveries gripped by violent terror. My only salvation, the shock of awakening. Something is very, very wrong here. Master storyteller Roberta Williams challenges you to experience the ultimate interactive nightmare.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "August 8, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Infini Entertainment Technology", "publishers": "Outrigger Koubou", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.07", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/125486-phantasm\n"}
