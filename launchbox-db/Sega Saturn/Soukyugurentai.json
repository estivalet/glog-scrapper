{"altername_name": ["Soukyugurentai Okuyo", "Terra Diver", "Soukyuu Gurentai", "Soukyuu Gurentai Otokuyou"], "name": "Soukyugurentai", "overview": "Humanity has decimated the Earth, and moved on to space colonization in their search of resources, namely fossil fuels. For years mining facilities are operated on the Moon and Mars while Earth's trading companies work together to revive the planet's economy. One company rises above all others - the Jin-Sei Corporation - and soon finds itself the de facto leader and resource controller in many sectors. As years pass, the age of Earth's rehabilitation is replaced by increased competition on the part of the trading companies and suddenly violence is introduced into the equation. In-fighting for different sectors and resources becomes common. The Eight Luck Interstellar Development Inc., the second largest company behind Jin-Sei, begins creating alliances with other smaller companies the world-over - their plan? To take over Mars and monopolize the outsourcing of those goods and take control of terraforming initiatives. Using the popular threat of eco-terrorism to hide facts from the public, a war begins between Eight Luck and the Jin-Sei.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "February 7, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Eighting", "publishers": "Raizing", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.03", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terra_Diver", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMWhT7G_k9g", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/57149-soukyugurentai\n"}
