{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gunbird", "overview": "Gunbird is a vertically scrolling shoot 'em up developed by Psikyo. It hit the Japanese arcade in 1994 and was followed by a Japanese release to the Saturn and the Playstation in the following year. The game is set in a fantasy setting with steampunk elements. Lush forests and medieval castles meet steam trains and mech robots. Instead of piloting the genre-traditional space ships, Gunbird lets the player chose between five different characters (Ash, Marion, Valnus, Yuan Nang and Tetsu) who traverse the game world on broomstick, jet packs and pedal-powered helicopters on a quest to find the pieces of a magic mirror across seven stages.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "December 15, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Psikyo", "publishers": "Atlus", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.08", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunbird", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/23220-gunbird\n"}
