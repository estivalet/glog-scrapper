{"altername_name": [], "name": "Spot Goes to Hollywood", "overview": "The central character in this game is Spot, the little red guy from the 7-Up TV commercials. Spot has somehow become trapped in a movie projector. As he jumps from film to film, he encounters many classic film genres that make up all the different levels of the game. The main levels are a pirate movie, an adventure movie, and a horror movie, but there are many other bonus films to unlock. The game is played from an isometric perspective. As you control spot, you have to collect 5 Hollywood stars per level to unlock hidden areas and ultimately complete the game 100%", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "January 1, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Burst", "publishers": "Virgin Interactive Entertainment", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.09", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot_Goes_To_Hollywood", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6537-spot-goes-to-hollywood\n"}
