{"altername_name": ["Heart of Darkness"], "name": "Heart of Darkness", "overview": "The game took six years to develop and went through a number of iterations - in 1996 a Sega Saturn version was advertised (to be published by Virgin Interactive Entertainment), but a release did not materialise. It was also thought to have been picked up by Sega themselves, to be released on the Saturn before the PlayStation and PC in 1997[5], but again these plans fell through. In the end, Interplay published the game in North America and Ocean Software (later Infogrames) published it in Europe. In 1996 Sega signed a deal for the console version to be a Sega Saturn exclusive, with the PC version to be held off until after the Saturn version was released. A release date of October 1996 was announced with the Saturn version, but as this date approached the publisher announced that the game would not be ready until late 1997. Sega Saturn Magazine commented at the time that \"this is quickly becoming a joke of a situation. The game looked absolutely amazing when it was first sighted at an ECTS trade show a year or three ago, but unless it has radically changed from its sighting at E3 [in May 1996], it's going to be out-dated and out-quaffed by its contemporary software.\" With further delays, the Saturn was also no longer a commercially viable platform by the time Heart of Darkness was finished.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Amazing Studio", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_of_Darkness_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/122597-heart-of-darkness\n"}
