In the country of Machania, dragons are bred for the exclusive use of the dragoons, or Knights. Dragons with wings are normally executed as they are deemed to be a bad omen by the citizens. In the war with the Empire, Machania has begun to examine the ancient ways rather than to try to fight a futile war using technological advances. The Empire is technologically more advanced. Randy, the hero, and his newfound friend, the dragon he saved, want to turn the tide of battle.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "March 22, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "Team Andromeda", "publishers": "SEGA Europe", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.23", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panzer_Dragoon_II_Zwei", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHz0uBSmwnA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/8913-panzer-dragoon-ii-zwei\n"}
