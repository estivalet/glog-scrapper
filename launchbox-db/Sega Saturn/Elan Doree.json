This game adds a lot of new aspects to traditional fighting games, like flying dragons and magic attacks. Each character rides a dragon which means that you're actually supposed to be flying at all times. Most of the fighting takes place on a 2D plane, but you do have complete freedom of 3D movement.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "January 14, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Sai-Mate", "publishers": "Kamata and Partners", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.85", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siZe006OidY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/51127-elan-doree\n"}
