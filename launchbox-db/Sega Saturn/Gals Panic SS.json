{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gals Panic SS", "overview": "Gals Panic SS is the first game in the Gals Panic series designed specifically for home consoles. That said, there is no nudity. It is very similar to Gals Panic 4 before it in that all the girls are drawn in an anime style, with no photographic models whatsoever. The gameplay is changed in this game. The same basic gameplay of uncovering a girl's picture with Qix-like gameplay is used, but you spend 5 rounds on each girl. After this, instead of moving on to the next girl, the game saves and ends. You then play another girl after starting the game again. There is a gallery where the unlocked CG can be viewed. There are a total 12 models in the game, the last two unlocked after beating all the available girls. Some of these girls are reused from Gals Panic 4.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "September 27, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Kaneko", "publishers": "Mainichi Communications", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gals_Panic#Gals_Panic_SS", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5OUFqKZPeQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/58409-gals-panic-ss\n"}
