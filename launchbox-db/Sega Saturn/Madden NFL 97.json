{"altername_name": [], "name": "Madden NFL 97", "overview": "The Madden football series makes its debut on the 32-bit consoles with Madden NFL 97. Like the PC version, the game moves into the world of polygonal 3D graphics, but has a unique set of modes, teams and options. The game includes the 30 teams of the 1996 NFL season, the 1996 All-Madden team plus 68 classic teams from NFL history. Playing modes include Exhibition, Season and Tournament. All scheduled games during a season can be either played or simulated. The tournament is for either 8 or 16 players in single elimination mode. The game also includes the 30 team's home stadiums plus one extra arena in Hawaii. Many features introduced in previous titles are reused here: variable weather (including night games), injuries and substitutions, ten different penalties (all adjustable), two skill levels, a bluffing mode for play calling, color commentary by John Madden, instant replays, and team roster editing with player creation (stats are set from a point pool), trading, releasing and signing of free agents. Player records and season progress can be saved to memory card/backup RAM. A new feature is the possibility to change which team is controlled at any time during a game. During a game, the stadiums are rendered in polygonal texture-mapped 3D, with only the players, referees and ball as bitmaps. The game allows to choose from eight different camera perspectives, including views from the end zones and sidelines, a diagonal view and a \"classic cam\" emulating the perspective of earlier titles in the series on Genesis and SNES.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Tiburon Entertainment", "publishers": "EA Sports", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "8", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.08", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/10868-madden-nfl-97\n"}
