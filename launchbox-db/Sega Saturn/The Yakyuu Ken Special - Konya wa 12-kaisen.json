The same company made a Sega Saturn adaptation in 1995 and both versions were released exclusively in Japan. Despite what the name says, it is not a baseball game \u2014 it is a rather simplistic pornographic game where the goal is to get some young, dancing women to strip for you by beating them at rock paper scissors. This version features 4 exclusive women. It doesn't have a Sega rating; a small warning is placed at the top right corner of the front cover (Sega of Japan's master list gives it an X).", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "July 28, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Societa Daikanyama", "publishers": "Societa Daikanyama", "genres": "Casino", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.82", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/81814-the-yakyuu-ken-special-konya-wa-12-kaisen\n"}
