{"altername_name": [], "name": "Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Summoner", "overview": "A modern-day Japanese college student is about to go on a date with his girlfriend Kumiko, who has found a particularly interesting book about ancient Japanese history in the local library. On the way to the date the young man is attacked by demonic creatures and saved by the devil summoner Ky\u014dji Kuzunoha. Shortly thereafter, Kumiko is kidnapped by a mysterious man named Sid Davis, who hunts her boyfriend down and kills him. It appears that Ky\u014dji was killed as well, but the student's soul is miraculously transferred into his body. Taking Ky\u014dji's identity, the young man must now fill his place as a devil summoner, liberating the city from demons and locating Sid Davis in an attempt to rescue Kumiko. Devil Summoner continues the tradition of Megami Tensei games, being a role-playing game with a heavy emphasis on dungeon crawling and communication with randomly encountered enemies. Unlike the main Shin Megami Tensei series, the game is set entirely in modern-day Japan. The player navigates the protagonist on an overhead city map, while individual locations are maze-like 3D dungeons explored from a first-person perspective. For the most part the player controls the main protagonist and his associate Rei, while the other four available slots of an active party can be occupied by summoned demons.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "December 25, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Atlus", "publishers": "Atlus", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.88", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Megami_Tensei:_Devil_Summoner", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/89269-shin-megami-tensei-devil-summoner\n"}
