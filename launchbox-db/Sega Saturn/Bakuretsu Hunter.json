{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bakuretsu Hunter", "overview": "Bakuretsu Hunter is a Japanese-style adventure game based on the anime & manga series of the same title (known as Sorcerer Hunters outside Japan). The game follows roughly the same story as the TV show, expanded with new content and animated sequences: the main character Carrot Glac\u00e9, along with his brother Marron, and the sisters Tira and Chocola, are so-called \"Sorcerer Hunters\" who serve the church to track down and exact punishment on Sorcerers who use their magic to commit evil acts against other humans. The game proceeds mostly in a visual novel style, with voiced story sequences occasionally broken up with dialogue choices. There are also two mini-games which represent battles: a flag-raising minigame where the player must raise or lower the correct flag within the time limit, and a slot-machine battle where the results of the slot machine determine which actions each combatant takes. Both mini-games can also be freely played from the menu. The game was only released as a \"limited edition\" version, which includes a poster and a bonus disc that contains voice actor interviews and an illustration gallery.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "April 26, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Betop", "publishers": "I Max", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorcerer_Hunters#Video_games", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/31298-bakuretsu-hunter\n"}
