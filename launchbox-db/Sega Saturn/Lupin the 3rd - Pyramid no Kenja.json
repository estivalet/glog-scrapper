{"altername_name": ["Lupin Sansei: Pyramid no Kenja"], "name": "Lupin the 3rd: Pyramid no Kenja", "overview": "Lupin, while attempting to elude Zenigata in a desert region, stumbles upon a pyramid and decides to seek refuge inside. He quickly discovers gem stones hidden deep within the structure but there are more to these precious stones than meets the eye. Lupin III: Sage of the Pyramid features numerous anime cut scenes interspliced throughout the game which are sure to please and delight longtime Lupin fans. Players control Lupin via a third-person perspective and guide the character through stage designs featuring varying degrees of complexity. The game\u2019s single greatest flaw might be that controlling Lupin can, at times, be frustratingly difficult. Turning Lupin in-game is never an easy endeavor and this issue can directly result in the character\u2019s untimely demise when trying to escape from a trap or enemy.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "August 6, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Vantan International", "publishers": "Asmik", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90982-lupin-the-3rd-pyramid-no-kenja\n"}
