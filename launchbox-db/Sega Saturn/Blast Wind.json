{"altername_name": [], "name": "Blast Wind", "overview": "Blast Wind is a shoot-'em-up game released exclusively in Japan for the Sega Saturn in 1997. A nuclear shockwave has all but destroyed the entire population of Earth. The remaining humans on the planet were gathered aboard a ship called the Ark by a prophetic man named Noa. After the radiation dissipated, humankind emerged from the Ark and began building thriving civilizations. However, the fledgling civilization came under attack by a culture called Gorn. Gorn was a culture consisting of the embodiment of machines and artificiality. During the nuclear winter, Gorn was sealed beneath the Earth's crust and emerged when the remaining humans came out of the Ark. Humanity must fight back against Gorn, using ancient weapons unearthed by the new civilization and two \"Ultimate Destroyers\" known as Kyo and Forn.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "January 17, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "TechnoSoft", "publishers": "Technosoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.36", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOeChvbzj30", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/31313-blast-wind\n"}
