{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sega Flash Vol. 3", "overview": "Sega Flash Vol 3 is a Compilation demo featuring Daytona CCE, Virtual On, Tomb Raider, Worldwide Soccer 97, Bug Too!, and Fighting Vipers. Sega Flash Vol. 3 is the third demo disc in the Sega Flash series. It was released in 1996. Vol. 3 adopts a different presentational style to prior volumes, a style which would stick with the four volumes which followed. It contains four playable demos, however Sega Worldwide Soccer '97 is identical to the demo seen in Sega Flash Vol. 2 (though the title screen and in-game music has been removed). Daytona USA: Championship Circuit Edition forces the player to drive the standard Hornet car around the Dinosaur Canyon track, again without music. Cyber Troopers Virtual-On has music, but only allows the player to fight one enemy, and Tomb Raider covers the second stage of the game, with menus and options being stripped out. The videos are full-screen and are no-frills demonstrations of gameplay footage.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133607-sega-flash-vol-3\n"}
