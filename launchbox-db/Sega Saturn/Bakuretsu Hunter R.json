{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bakuretsu Hunter R", "overview": "Carrot, Marron, and the sisters Tira and Chocola are what are known as \"Sorcerer Hunters\": warriors who serve the church to punish those who would use magic for evil against other humans. Recently, several Sorcerer Hunters were found dead in the capitol, and Carrot and his team have been sent there to investigate these so-called \"Sorcerer Hunter Hunters\". Bakuretsu Hunter R is a Japanese-style adventure game based on the anime & manga series Bakuretsu Hunter. The game is divided into eight chapters, and looks at a glance like a Japanese-style RPG with turn-based battles and top-down exploration. However, the RPG elements are purely superficial; there is no experience or character growth system, no inventory to manage, and while it is possible to die, all encounters are scripted as part of each chapter's progression. There are also several different mini-games which appear throughout the story and can also be played from the main menu.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "August 8, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "craftman", "publishers": "King Records", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.12", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorcerer_Hunters#Video_games", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/31300-bakuretsu-hunter-r\n"}
