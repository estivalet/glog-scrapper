{"altername_name": ["Firestorm: Thunderhawk 2", "Thunderhawk 2: Firestorm", "Thunderhawk 2"], "name": "ThunderStrike 2", "overview": "Your name is General John T. Maclaine and you are the pilot of Firestorm 1, the lead dog in special attack missions to various parts of the world. Your helicopter is extremely powerful and carries the following weapons: 30mm Chain Gun, Firestorm Homing Missile, Rocket Pod, Runaway Cratering System (bombs), the Mk-84 500-Pound Bomb, Cluster Bombs, and the Anti-Ship Missile. These weapons -- plus excellent evasive, and attack maneuvers -- should be enough to help you succeed in attacks on drug runners and terrorists, from Columbia to Iraq. Thunder Strike 2 is the sequel to Core's Amiga, ST, PC & Sega CD game, AH-3 Thunderstrike. Like the previous game in the series, this is a helicopter simulator/shooter. It features realistic features like multiple weapons selection, full freedom of movement, and a mission-based structure. On the other hand, it also throws lots and lots of enemy tanks and helicopters at you to blow up.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "December 27, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Core Design", "publishers": "Core Design", "genres": "Flight Simulator", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.64", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firestorm:_Thunderhawk_2", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLcyDQJG5oQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/10937-thunderstrike-2\n"}
