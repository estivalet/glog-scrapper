{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tokimeki Memorial Taisen Tokkaedama", "overview": "Tokimeki Memorial: Taisen Tokkaedama is a puzzle game released in Japan based around the characters in Konami's immensely successful Tokimeki Memorial game, a (Japanese) high school life and dating simulation. Tokkaedama is the second puzzle game based upon TokiMeki, the first is called Tokimeki Memorial Taisen Puzzledama which has more similarities to PuyoPuyo than Tokkaedama. There are some differences between the PS1 and Saturn versions. the two versions have completely different sets of levels for Hirameki (Puzzle) Mode, secondly, the Saturn version, taking advantage of the system's internal clock/calendar, lets you enter both your birthday and Shiori's (just like in the actual Tokimemo game). Again, taking advantage of the internal calendar, the Saturn version will occasionally have character sketches on the \"now loading\" chalkboard. However, the Saturn version doesn't seem to have any attract mode demo battles though it does have some the music as CD tracks on the game disc. Most of the other differences between these two versions of the game are fairly minor.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "August 7, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.62", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/91455-tokimeki-memorial-taisen-tokkaedama\n"}
