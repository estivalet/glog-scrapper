This disc was bundled with issue #58 of Mega Force in France. It was also distributed with UK magazine Saturn Power, being retitled Saturn Power No. 2. The disc contains three demos, consisting of Actua Soccer: Club Edition, Hardcore 4x4 and perhaps most significantly, the unreleased Saturn port of Re-Loaded.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "July 1, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gremlin Interactive", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133583-saturn-power-no-2\n"}
