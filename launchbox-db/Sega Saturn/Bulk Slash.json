{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bulk Slash", "overview": "\u201cWhen Sonic Team\u2019s Burning Rangers was released on the Saturn, proclaimed to \u201cpush the system to its limits\u201d but Bulk Slash still surpasses. With very large areas, multiple enemies, and having the ability to take battles to the sky, yet no slowdowns. Utilizing all Sega Saturn\u2019s power having real 3D polygons unlike many other 3D titles that were released, which preferred to use layers instead\u2026 Bulk Slash [has a] Neo-Tokyo feel ala Neon Genesis Evangelion persona to it. You start off on mission based objectives; having them explained using 3D maps of the areas. Your mech is equipped with machine guns, grenades, a laser sword for close combat, and the ability to transform into a jet. The jet has twin machine guns and can launch six homing missiles at a time reflecting Panzer Dragoon type gameplay. With a true full-360 degree range of movement \u2013 you can go anywhere on foot, and you can fly anywhere in jet mode. Powerups are everywhere, from flamethrowers, homing lasers and electric bolt grenades. Each objective is different; from destroying main targets, to protecting a ship from being destroyed. But every level has a boss encounter. Most bosses are huge, and take up most of the screen.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "July 11, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "C.A.
