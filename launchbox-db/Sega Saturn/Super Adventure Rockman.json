{"altername_name": [], "name": "Super Adventure Rockman", "overview": "Super Adventure Rockman is an interactive movie video game based on the Mega Man universe. It revolves primarily around the player watching pre-recorded animation cutscenes depicting the storyline. The game is divided into three different disks, each presenting itself as an anime episode and containing roughly a half-hour of video footage. Certain points allow the player to select a branching path, which can either lead them to helpful items or an ambush by enemies, sometimes utilizing quick-time events. If the player is ambushed, they are transferred to a rail shooter-like minigame where they must point an on-screen cursor onto enemies and shoot them. Some of these fights feature Robot Masters from earlier Mega Man games, particularly Mega Man, Mega Man II, and Mega Man III.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "September 23, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kouyousha", "publishers": "Capcom", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Adventure_Rockman", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/130199-super-adventure-rockman\n"}
