{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sega Rally Championship", "overview": "Sega Rally Championship is a 1995 racing game developed by AM3 on the Sega Saturn. The unique selling point of Sega Rally was the ability to drive on different surfaces (including asphalt, gravel and mud), with different friction properties, with the car's handling changing accordingly. As the first racing game to incorporate this feature, Sega Rally is considered to be one of the milestones in the evolution of the racing game genre. It was also an early rally racing game and featured cooperative gameplay alongside the usual competitive multiplayer. It has been considered the best racing game of all time by Retro Gamer magazine, which ranked it at the top of its \"Top 25 Racing Games Ever\" list. Another unique point about this game is the Game Over screen, the player is shown a faded out version of the title screen, covered by the words, \"GAME OVER\" in red; the player then hears an overly optimistic voice clip: \"Game over, yeah!\" This game over screen has gained some popularity across the internet. The music for the game was composed by Takenobu Mitsuyoshi.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "December 28, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "Sega AM3", "publishers": "Sega Enterprises", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.39", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Rally_Championship", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/10752-sega-rally-championship\n"}
