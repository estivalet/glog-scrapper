{"altername_name": [], "name": "Delisoba Deluxe", "overview": "Delisoba Deluxe is an action driving game in which the player must drive a scooter to deliver soba noodles while avoiding obstacles. It is a promotional tie-in based on a popular game called Delisoba (short for \"Delivery Soba\") on the TV variety show Sekiguchi Hiroshi no Tokyo Friend Park II broadcast by TBS between 1994 and 2011. On the original show, one player controls the scooter in a video game, while the other player sits on the back of a simulated scooter; if the first player crashes in the game, the second player feels the impact on the scooter and has to try not to drop the delivery. Deluxe is a \"port\" of this game to the Saturn and was not sold in stores, but rather given away at the show (either to winners or to audience members, exactly what is unknown). The \"TV Original\" mode replicates the Delisoba experience from the show, tasking the player with reaching the end of the course within the time limit, avoiding obstacles such as other cars, banana peels, and angry cows, to deliver the noodles to the TBS television building in Tokyo. There are also several extra modes: a \"Time Attack\" mode that tracks the player's best times, a \"Coin Links\" mode where the player collects coins strewn across the track for points, an Arrange mode where various options can be changed such as adding special items or changing the max speed of the scooter, and a Track Edit mode where custom courses can be made.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "1997", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Cave", "publishers": "Tokyo Broadcasting System", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcAnOFIohZo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/122591-delisoba-deluxe\n"}
