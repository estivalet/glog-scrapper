{"altername_name": ["Pro Pinball: The Web"], "name": "Pro Pinball", "overview": "In this pinball simulation, you play on a table called \"The Web\". With the help of three flippers, you must send the ball into the various openings, trapdoors, and ramps. You can gain various bonuses (such as several balls to knock at the same time) if you play particularly well. Some of the targets activate special missions when you hit them with a ball. Those missions vary from aiming at specific targets to playing mini-games, such as shooting asteroids. After you have completed five missions, you'll be able to face the Dark Queen, the off-screen antagonist of the game.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "November 30, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Cunning Developments", "publishers": "Interplay", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.27", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Pinball:_The_Web", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/10894-pro-pinball\n"}
