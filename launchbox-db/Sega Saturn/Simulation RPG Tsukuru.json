{"altername_name": ["Simulation RPG Tkool"], "name": "Simulation RPG Tsukuru", "overview": "Simulation RPG Tsukuru is, much akin to its brethren in the RPG Maker line of games, a construction kit and editor to make RPGs. In this case, it's \"simulation\" RPGs or, as they're more commonly known, tactical/strategy RPGs in the vein of Fire Emblem and Shining Force. The construction kit gives the player a menu based interface where it's possible to change almost every detail of the game being made, down to the character sprites, background music and individual statistics for each character.", "platform": "Sega Saturn", "release_date": "September 17, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Pegasus Japan", "publishers": "ASCII", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/107195-simulation-rpg-tsukuru\n"}
