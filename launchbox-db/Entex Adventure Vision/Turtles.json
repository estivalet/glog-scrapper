{"altername_name": [], "name": "Turtles", "overview": "This Adventure Vision cartridge is based on the famous Konami arcade game and includes all the key features and elements of its big brother. It's your job to rescue six little turtlettes and take them home. It may sound easy, but you had better watch out because the beetles are after you. Each floor contains eight mystery squares. Behind six of the squares are those cute little turtlettes. But beware, 'cause the other two contain beetles. If a beetle gets too close you can use a bug bomb, but use them wisely, because you can only use one at a time. So plug your cartridge into Adventure Vision, grab the joy stick, hit the start button and get ready for action and excitement.", "platform": "Entex Adventure Vision", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Entex", "publishers": "Entex", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.18", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entex_Adventure_Vision", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKNGmg3ccM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40400-turtles\n"}
