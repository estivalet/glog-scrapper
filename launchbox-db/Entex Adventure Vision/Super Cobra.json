You are the pilot and your chopper awaits full of fuel and armed with sidewinder missiles and bombs. Your mission is to fly your helicopter over 10 different terrains and get the booty at the secret enemy base. It may sound easy but watch out. There are enemy rockets, magnetic space mines, UFO's, and the most treacherous terrain an Ace pilot like you has ever encountered. So plug this cartridge into an Adventure Vision, grab the JOY STICK, and get ready for action.", "platform": "Entex Adventure Vision", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Entex", "publishers": "Entex", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.38", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entex_Adventure_Vision", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIgqa4nCAeo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/47393-super-cobra\n"}
