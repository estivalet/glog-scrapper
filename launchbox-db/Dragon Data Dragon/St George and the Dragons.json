A wizard has imprisoned a number of maidens in an enchanted castle and it's up to George to free them. The spell of the castle is tied to a rock and to free the maidens George has to use his sword to cleave the rock. The rock is located in the bottom left corner of the screen and to reach it George must use a bridge to cross a river. At the same time it's necessary to avoid or kill the fire breathing dragon that is hunting the hero. Getting hit by the dragon's fire or running into the water leads to a life being lost. Once the rock has been hit by the sword the level is completed and the player earns one point and moves on to another level which works exactly the same way.", "platform": "Dragon 32/64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "CRL (Computer Rentals Limited)", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/125516-st-george-and-the-dragons\n"}
