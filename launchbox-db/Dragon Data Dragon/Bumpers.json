The player creates a randomly generated maze ranging in size from 1 x 1 to 13 x 15, where all the walls are invisible at the beginning of the game.

If the player bumps into too many walls, they restart at the beginning of the maze. The first player to reach the other player's starting point is the winner. There are 4 levels of computer difficulty.", "platform": "Dragon 32/64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mark Data Products", "publishers": "Dragon Data", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/121264-bumpers\n"}
