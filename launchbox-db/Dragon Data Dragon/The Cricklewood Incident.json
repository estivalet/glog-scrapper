{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Cricklewood Incident", "overview": "Life is pretty good being the sole owner of the Vole-Strangler millions. You, Arnold Q. Vole-Strangler (the 14th) lie relaxed in a padded cell recalling the sumptuousness of Castle Vole-Strangler and the verdant lushness of Vole-Strangler Acres. Things haven't been so ripping since the nubile Cynthia Smythe-Drongo ran off with that Spaniard from Llandudno. After all, apart from playing a mean pair of castanets, what could he offer that the Vole-Strangler empire couldn't? Still, no point in worrying about it, there are more important problems to consider. For example, what to do until the launderette opens? Of course, the very thing! Why not pop out and find the HOLY GRAIL? It won't take long to get there and back again.", "platform": "Dragon 32/64", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "WJP Associates", "publishers": "Salamander Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uuHvdS2uDQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/125704-the-cricklewood-incident\n"}
