{"altername_name": [], "name": "Boulder Crash", "overview": "Boulder Clash is a clone of the ever-popular Boulder Dash.Like in its role model, you are a miner-type person digging your way around tile by tile in some kind of underground complex filled with boulders and crystals. You must collect a set number of crystals to clear a level. The level wraps around at the borders, so it's easy to get lost. As you dig through the earth, you must watch out when you pass below boulders, since these can drop down at you. If there is a mass of boulders, you can start a rockslide which can very well kill you. On the other hand, these rock slides are often a necessity if you are to reach crystals jammed between the boulders. Digging the correct canals to channel the boulders into is an essential part of the game's strategy. The game runs entirely in monochrome high resolution mode and allows you to play against the clock and choose levels with some freedom.", "platform": "Dragon 32/64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Blaby Computer Games", "publishers": "Blaby Computer Games", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.7", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/127521-boulder-crash\n"}
