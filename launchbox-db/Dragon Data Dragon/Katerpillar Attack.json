{"altername_name": [], "name": "Katerpillar Attack", "overview": "This is a remake of the arcade classic Centipede. The objective of the game is to score points by shooting katerpillars, mushrooms and spiders. You control your ship at the bottom of the screen and you can move sideways and a bit up and down. The katerpillar starts at the top of the screen and moves sideways. If the katerpillar hits an obstacle, it moves down and changes direction. If the katerpillar is hit, one of its segments is turned into a muchroom and the katerpillar is split in two pieces moving in opposite directions. Spiders will drop from the top of the screen and bounce across the bottom of the screen to make the game even harder. This game requires an analogue joystick, and your ship's position is directly determined by the joystick position.", "platform": "Dragon 32/64", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Microdeal", "publishers": "Microdeal", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.88", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/108303-katerpillar-attack\n"}
