{"altername_name": [], "name": "Storm", "overview": "Storm is a clone of Atari's arcade hit, Tempest, but whereas that game used sharp vector graphics, this version is rendered in blocky text graphics. You control a ship moving along the edge of a tunnel-like construction. From the far end of the tunnel come coloured bars of various colours. Moving around the tunnel's mouth, you shoot the bars until you reach a set score, which will promote you to the next level. With only 99 shots granted on each level, it is better to let the bars reach the end of the tunnel than to miss them with your gun. One kind of bar that should not be missed, though, is the orange kind, called \u201dMillibars\u201d. These will, if they reach the edge of the tunnel, chase you around. After a while, the Millibars will disappear, but if more than one has reached the edge where you are, avoiding them long enough can be very difficult. The game becomes gradually more difficult as you progress through the levels, and on later levels, the tunnel itself is no longer shown.", "platform": "Dragon 32/64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Computerware", "publishers": "MicroDeal Ltd.", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Hkto71hgrA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/125430-storm\n"}
