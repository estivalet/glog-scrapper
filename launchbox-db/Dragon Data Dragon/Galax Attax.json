{"altername_name": [], "name": "Galax Attax", "overview": "Galax Attax is a clone of Namco's Galaxian, which was one of the first shoot'em'ups to deviate from the original Space Invaders fare in favor of things such as aliens with individual behavior and movement. Your goal: Shoot down all the aliens as they fly in formation. If they break free from their formation and fly at you, they are worth twice as many points, while also being more dangerous. The Dragon version has been reprogrammed with a white backdrop, which makes the orange bullets harder to see, resulting in an overall more difficult game.", "platform": "Dragon 32/64", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tom D.
