{"altername_name": [], "name": "Speed Racer", "overview": "Speed Racer is a racing game, played from a third-person perspective, similar to Pole Position. The aim of the game is to pass a specific number of cars during each lap of a race. Success allows the player to continue with the next lap while failure will lead to game over. To win a race, five laps have to be completed and each lap is two miles long. Controls are basic and limited to steering, accelerating and braking. The shoulder of the road should be avoided since driving on it for too long will lead to the car stopping. A repair crew will then appear and put on new tires. The game consists of four different race tracks that can be played in any order. The game was created by Steven Hirsch for MichTron.", "platform": "Dragon 32/64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "MichTron", "publishers": "Microdeal", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.57", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86325-speed-racer\n"}
