{"altername_name": ["The King"], "name": "Donkey King", "overview": "Donkey King is an unofficial remake of the coin-op game Donkey Kong. When Microdeal found itself facing accusations of infringing on the original Donkey Kong series (see the Dragon User magazine of June 1983 for more details), the name was changed to The King. The game can be played at normal or slow speed. It is also possible to play in practice mode. In this mode you will start the game with 12 lives, but you will not be able to enter your name in the high score table.", "platform": "Dragon 32/64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tom Mix Software", "publishers": "Microdeal", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.71", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/87070-donkey-king\n"}
