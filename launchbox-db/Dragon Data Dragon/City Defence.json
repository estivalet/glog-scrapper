{"altername_name": [], "name": "City Defence", "overview": "City Defence is a variant of Missile Command. You have a laser turret on the ground, as the sole line of defence against incoming ballistic missiles. Using the joystick, you must guide your cross hairs at the warheads and push the button to shoot them down before they hit one of your six cities. Your aim must be exact to hit the missiles themselves, and more points are awarded for more exact hits. High scores give you extra cities, and the game is over when all are destroyed. Somewhat strangely, even missile hits on the grounds of a destroyed city counts, which will lead to game over even when there are cities remaining.", "platform": "Dragon 32/64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Shards Software", "publishers": "Shards Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c8tQ4zHl1Y", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/121312-city-defence\n"}
