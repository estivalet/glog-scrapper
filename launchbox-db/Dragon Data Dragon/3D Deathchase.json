{"altername_name": [], "name": "3D Deathchase", "overview": "3D Deathchase is a conversion of the highly rated ZX Spectrum 16K game by Mervyn J. Estcourt. This version was written by James McKay and was based upon the disassembled Z80 source made by Richard Wilson for his Amstrad CPC conversion. Like the original, this also fits into 16K (which some Tandy Color Computer models have installed). 3D Deathchase features a chase through a forest on a motorbike, from an over-the-shoulder perspective. The aim is to shoot two other motorbikes and a bonus item (a helicopter or a tank) while dodging the trees. There are 8 sectors to beat, split into forest and arctic sections (the original had day and night sections, but the Dragon palette did not suit that, a bit of artistic licence was used).", "platform": "Dragon 32/64", "release_date": "2009", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "James McKay", "publishers": "Cronosoft", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.9", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014SCePFq5c", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/163827-3d-deathchase\n"}
