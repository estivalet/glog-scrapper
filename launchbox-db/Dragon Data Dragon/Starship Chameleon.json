{"altername_name": [], "name": "Starship Chameleon", "overview": "You are the Starship Chameleon commissioned to protect your planet by intercepting the falling bombs launched by the enemy Gabolators from above. Beware, this is a dangerous mission! There are five types of bombs. Bombs are destroyed by running the Starship into them. However, this is only effective if the Starship and the bomb are in the same state, i.e. matter (blue) or anti-matter (yellow). To switch the state of your Starship, press the fire button on the joystick. No matter what colour you are, red mines can destroy you. You begin the game with three Starships and you lose one every time you are destroyed. You are rewarded with an extra ship every 10,000 points.", "platform": "Dragon 32/64", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Computerware", "publishers": "Dragon Data", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/166932-starship-chameleon\n"}
