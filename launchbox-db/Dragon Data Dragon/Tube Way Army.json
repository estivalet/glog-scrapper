You start out flying your spaceship above a hostile grounds, protected by ground-to-air missiles. You can shoot down the airbourne missiles, or bomb them on the ground. Also posted on the ground are fuel silos which you must bomb from time to time to replenish your own fuel supply.

The game runs in four-colour medium resolution mode and uses lots of sampled speech.", "platform": "Dragon 32/64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Rainbow Software", "publishers": "Crystal Computing", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/HNztP2hE6cI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/125696-tube-way-army\n"}
