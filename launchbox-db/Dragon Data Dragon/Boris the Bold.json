{"altername_name": [], "name": "Boris the Bold", "overview": "A colourful arcade game, Boris the Bold has you guiding the face-with-legs called Boris around a series of platform levels. There is a moving gap in each floor for Boris to fall through, so that he can reach the exit at the bottom of the screen. Boris must walk to the hole or wait until it reaches him, but waiting can be dangerous, since there is a bouncing ball hunting him. As if the ball wasn't enough, there are additional nasties patrolling certain floors back and forth, and batteries which will fire at Boris if he remains in the same place for too long. Boris has no offensive measures, but he can \"hyperjump\" to a random location on the floor he is standing on, or alternatively to the floor immediately above him. Due to the random nature of the hyperjumps, though, Boris can end up straight next to another enemy.", "platform": "Dragon 32/64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Blaby Computer Games", "publishers": "Blaby Computer Games", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/121259-boris-the-bold\n"}
