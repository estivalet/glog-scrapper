{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Bells", "overview": "Written by Drew Marshall, this is a fairly close copy of Ocean/Century's arcade platformer, Hunchback. Your goal is to traverse each screen filled with perils, so that you may reach the bell that is placed on the right side. Your bell-ringer has two different jumps. One is for jumping up in the air, so that you can avoid projectiles, and the other one is a long jump for bridging gaps. Each screen must be crossed within a short amount of time, or Quasimodo will be struck by lightning.", "platform": "Dragon 32/64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Blaby Computer Games", "publishers": "Blaby Computer Games", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/87096-the-bells\n"}
