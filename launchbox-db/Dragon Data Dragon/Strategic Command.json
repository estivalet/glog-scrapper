{"altername_name": ["Alto Mando: Objetivo Invasi\u00f3n"], "name": "Strategic Command", "overview": "Strategic Command is a strategy game for two players that is played on a map with five islands. Each player has three bases which produce units: an army base, a naval base and a capital. The army and naval bases can only produce their own kind of units while the capital can produce both. To win the game a player has to take control of the capital of the enemy. There are sixteen types of units and they are deployed in task forces of up to three units. Task forces can then be moved around the screen and when getting close to an enemy combat will occur. Each unit has an attacking factor and a defensive factor. Each attack will cause the defensive factor of the target to decrease with the attacking factor of the attacker. When it reaches zero the unit is destroyed. Additionally players can lay mines through special units that will be completely destroy the unit stepping on to that tile.", "platform": "Dragon 32/64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Alan J.
