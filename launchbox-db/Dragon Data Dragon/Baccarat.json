{"altername_name": [], "name": "Baccarat", "overview": "Baccarat is a card game normally played by the rich and famous as well as James Bond in the elegant atmosphere of the most exclusive casinos in the world. This computer version was programmed by M Turley for Cable Software. The objective of the game is to score nearest to 9 with 2 or 3 cards. 10's and court cards count as 0, with other cards their pip value. Three decks are used and shuffled together, so it is possible to draw and even hold in any one hand the same card up to three times during a game. This computer version of Baccarat allows up to three players to compete against the Banker. The Bank offers a stake at the beginning of each hand, and Banco is called by the player accepting it, with Player 1 having first refusal. A player without enough money cannot call Banco (a beep sounds if tried). Players could, as a team, try to break the Bank, or play competitively for the highest score.", "platform": "Dragon 32/64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Cable Software", "publishers": "Cable Software", "genres": "Casino", "max_players": "3", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/87768-baccarat\n"}
