{"altername_name": [], "name": "Alcatraz II", "overview": "Alcatraz II is a stealth game where you need to escape the Alcatraz II prison by passing through several of the prison's wings undetected. The game contains several single-screen rooms as well as a minotaur's lair. Each level has a maze-like structure with passages blocked off by force fields. The fields open up when a guard passes. The player's character needs to remain undetected, but also needs to use the opportunity to quickly move past the force fields while they are open. A level is won by reaching the exit on the other side of the room. The game keeps track of the score, saves the high score and shows the number of wings that have been completed.", "platform": "Dragon 32/64", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Spectral Associates", "publishers": "Microdeal", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtube.com/watch?v=3BW2amlIhKY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/121190-alcatraz-ii\n"}
