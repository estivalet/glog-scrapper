All monsters explode laterally when hit, and if the player touches this explosion, they also lose a life. Each room is timed, and if the player moves to slowly through a room, they lose a life. At the end of each room is a door, which must be shot to enter. If the player loses a life, they restart at the most recent door they passed. At the end of each dungeon level is a ghost which must be destroyed. There are 3 levels of difficulty.
