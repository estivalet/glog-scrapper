{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dragon Trek (Salamander)", "overview": "Dragon Trek is a commercial variant of the Star Trek game that originally appeared on mainframe computers. At the start, the difficulty and length of the game (determining the size of the galaxy) can be selected. The player then takes command of the starship Enterprise, trying to eliminate a specific number of Klingon ships using phasers or photon torpedoes. Phasers have three different range settings, the longer the distance, the more energy is consumed for a shot. Movement at impulse speed is done with joystick control, the keyboard is used for command input. To travel to different quadrants faster, the warp engines are used. The scanners of the Enterprise are limited in their capabilities, to get information about the contents of a quadrant, a hyperprobe may be launched if necessary. In addition to friendly starbases which can be docked for faster damage repair and supplies, a quadrant may also contain hazards other than the Klingons, like black holes.", "platform": "Dragon 32/64", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Salamander Software", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsffitkCXP8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/167038-dragon-trek-salamander\n"}
