{"altername_name": [], "name": "Trun", "overview": "Trun is a series of small games made famous by the movie Tron: -Cycles is a \u201dlight cycles\u201d game where you draw a line and must trap the opponent inside that line, without colliding with his line. - Cone puts you in a cramped space where you must shoot moving blocks so that you can advance until you reach the cone at the top of the screen. If you don't advance, you will be hit in the back by an advancing bar, and if you don't shoot the blocks, you will be hit by those instead. - Tanks presents a top-down view of a maze, where you must guide your tank and shoot the opposing tanks. - Spiders consists of a screen filled with spiders. Move your little man and try to shoot all the spiders (only one shot can be on the screen at any time, so aim carefully) and then proceed to the exit before the time is out. As you finish all four games, selectable from a menu, you progress to the next level with more and harder enemies.", "platform": "Dragon 32/64", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Blaby Computer Games", "publishers": "Blaby Computer Games", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/127524-trun\n"}
