{"altername_name": [], "name": "Shark Treasure", "overview": "Shark Treasure is a single screen action game where the player controls a diver who has to collect as many gold bars as possible. The gold is located on the sea floor and the player has to swim down and pick up the treasure before returning to the boat at the surface. This is made more complicated by the presence of huge sharks that swim back and forth across the screen and who will quickly eat any divers that get in their way. Thus they have to be avoided and to help the player is equipped with a limited supply of flash grenades which scare the sharks and cause them to turn around and swim in the opposite direction. Only a total amount of three grenades and gold bars can be carried at a time and the player therefore has to make several dives to get all the gold. The game starts with two sharks in the water but there is one more added each time the sea floor is cleared of treasure. Th game was originally released in 1982, it was once again released by Microdeal in 1985.", "platform": "Dragon 32/64", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Greg W.
