{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pacdroids", "overview": "A Pac-Man game with a sci-fi twist, Pac Droids has you piloting a space ship in a maze patrolled by flying saucers. As in the real Pac-Man, you gobble up dots while avoiding the saucers, clearing the level by eating all dots. Also, you have power-pills which turn your ship into a cross hair. Pressing fire will fire in the direction you're moving, eliminating all ghosts and dots which get in your way. You have three shots per life. Even in your cross hairs mode, the blue saucer must be avoided, since it is invincible to your shots. Enemies will also lay mines, which are easily confused with power pills.", "platform": "Dragon 32/64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Charles Forsythe", "publishers": "Programmer's Guild", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/125783-pacdroids\n"}
