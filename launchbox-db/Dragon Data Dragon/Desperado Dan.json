{"altername_name": ["Desperado Dan and His Amazing Escape to Freedom"], "name": "Desperado Dan", "overview": "Desperado Dan must escape to freedom, being trapped in a set of green-screen platform levels. Each screen is guarded not only by guards, but also by a cannon which fires a single bouncing ball to be avoided. Dan must jump across all the obstacles, but luckily, he can leap very far. Another obstacle are the animated doors which open and close. As you progress through the game, the motifs change. Dan must mount a jet-ski and jump over whales and octopuses, but the controls and mechanisms remain basically the same, although the screens become even more crowded and faster.", "platform": "Dragon 32/64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Blaby Computer Games", "publishers": "Blaby Computer Games", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/127522-desperado-dan\n"}
