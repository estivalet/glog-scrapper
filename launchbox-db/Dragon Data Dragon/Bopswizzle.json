{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bopswizzle", "overview": "The player has come to search for the three legendary black pearls of the ancients which are hidden within the City of Ages. The city is home to several nasties, including: Gloops, jellified blobs of protoplasm whose very touch is deadly, Smoochers, giant lips who descend onto their prey and kiss them to death, Wiggles, tiny worm-like creatures who burrow their way through everything, Bobwangles, furry creatures whose chief delight is stealing hair, and Yerkles, sneaky creatures who will catch the player and drop them into the nearest midden. Each turn, the player will encounter a special event. They might encounter the Smoochers, in which case the player has 3 tries to correctly guess the right number from 1 - 10. Failure to do so loses the game. If encountering the Wiggles, the player has 2 tries to guess a number from 1 to 6, and is given a hint after the first number if it's higher or lower. The Yerkles sends the player to an arcade sequence where they must navigate through a moving passageway. The player may encounter gold, the Bird of Paradise who offers clues, or may find one of the black pearls. If the player can recover all 3 black pearls they are victorious.", "platform": "Dragon 32/64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "A. M.
