The aim is to collect ten flags that are scattered around the maze while avoiding the AI controlled cars that chase and attempt to crash into the player. In the maze there are fuel tanks that needs to be collected or the car's fuel might run out. To delay the chaser cars the player is able to release smoke from the exhaust. The amount of smoke that can be used is dependent on the level. There are ten levels with later levels feature more cars and boulders that block the path. The game ends when the player has run out of all three lives by crashing or running out of fuel.", "platform": "Dragon 32/64", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "P.
