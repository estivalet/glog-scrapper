{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pedro", "overview": "Pedro's flower gardens are famed throughout Mexico - unfortunately for him, information as to their quality appears to have reached the animal kingdom. His prized flowers are under attack from hordes of animals, which must be stopped. Pedro's task is to set up blockades and barriers to cut off the animals' routes to his flowers. He will have to take multiple trips to block off any particular path. Smaller animals can also be stopped by stamping on them. When flowers are eaten, Pedro must replenish them by planting seeds - allowing time for them to grow, as the game is lost if all the seeds are gone. As well as the animals, he must watch out for the Tramp, who tries to steal his seeds. The game is viewed in a 3D forced perspective, although movement is purely 2D.", "platform": "Dragon 32/64", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/125513-pedro\n"}
