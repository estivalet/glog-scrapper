{"altername_name": [], "name": "Space War", "overview": "You command the last combat viper and must break through the enemy fighters and the defenses of the death star to win. Beware the black hole as you manoeuvre your ship as its gravity pull can suck you in. The death star has a defense shield with one weak spot in it. You must position yourself to fire a photon torpedo through it, whilst dodging defensive missiles from the death star. Invisible space mines can blow you apart, your only warning is a sonic alert just before they explode.", "platform": "Dragon 32/64", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Microdeal Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/167043-space-war\n"}
