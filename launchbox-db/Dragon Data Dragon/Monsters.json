{"altername_name": [], "name": "Monsters", "overview": "In the advert, Monsters is described as \"a superb version of the Arcade game Dig Dug-Panic\", and indeed it is a clone of Space Panic. On a Lode Runner-like screen consisting of platforms and ladders, patrolled by small spinning creatures going back and forth across the platforms, you must pick up an item and leave the screen the way you came. Unlike many other platform games, you can't jump, but instead you can dig a hole in the ground for you or an enemy to fall through. If an enemy falls through, it climbs up a ladder to the platform it came from. As you progress, the number of nasties is increased. Each level, rendered in four-colour mode, is randomly generated, so that each session is dissimilar to the other. You have only sixty seconds to clear a level, or one of your three lives is expended.", "platform": "Dragon 32/64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gordon Russell", "publishers": "Softek Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/166289-monsters\n"}
