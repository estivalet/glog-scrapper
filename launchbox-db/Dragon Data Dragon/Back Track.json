{"altername_name": [], "name": "Back Track", "overview": "The protagonist of this game, who looks like one of those head-on-feet characters which three-year-olds tend to draw, is the subject of a cruel experiment. Level after level, he is locked inside a maze and must get out before his willpower reaches zero. This means that you will have to find all the necessary keys for locking up the exit, and these are spread all over the maze, of which only one room can be seen at a time. Try to find the map, it will facilitate easier navigation, but each time you look at it time will run much faster, giving you a lower score. The maze is filled with certain dangers, in the guise of snakes which will eat you alive if you startle them. Try to avoid their rooms, or cross them quickly when they turn away from your direction. Finding items such as keys, food or maps will keep your willpower up. The game runs in medium resolution in four colours and features a 3D animation top view of your character as well as animated sequences between levels.", "platform": "Dragon 32/64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Incentive Software", "publishers": "Incentive Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtube.com/watch?v=sN-RxQ_iiJE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/114911-back-track\n"}
