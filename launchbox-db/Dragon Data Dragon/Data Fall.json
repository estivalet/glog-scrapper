{"altername_name": [], "name": "Data Fall", "overview": "Data Fall is a 1-player arcade game for the TRS-80 CoCo. The player controls a series of horizontally moving buckets at the bottom of the screen to try to catch pieces of data as they fall from the top. Each piece missed causes 1 of the 5 buckets to disappear. Data progressively falls at a faster rate, and if the player misses 5 items, it's game over.", "platform": "Dragon 32/64", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Pocket Money Software", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/126416-data-fall\n"}
