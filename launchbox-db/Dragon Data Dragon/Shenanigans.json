The adventure begins, of all places, in the protagonist's own modest bedroom apartment. From that point players will need to roam the streets and interact with other people during their adventure. They will explore woods, caves, and, of course, encounter a leprechaun along the way. But remember, the prize is that pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. This graphical interactive fiction game uses standard single letter direction (N, S, E, W) for movement. Players can also SAVE their current location on cassette for restarting later. The command parser is a standard verb noun system (eg, \"Go Door\").", "platform": "Dragon 32/64", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/125940-shenanigans\n"}
