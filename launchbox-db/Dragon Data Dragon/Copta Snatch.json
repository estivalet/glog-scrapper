{"altername_name": [], "name": "Copta Snatch", "overview": "Copta Snatch plays much like Konami's Super Cobra, only the helicopter you're controlling actually works a little more like a real helicopter. No more forced scrolling; here you can hover above a target or strafe back and forth above the landscape. Hovering lets you drop bombs, otherwise you fire forwards in the direction you're travelling. The landscape is littered with missile silos and anti-aircraft guns which fire at you at the slightest chance. You also have to keep an eye on your fuel level \u2013 when you're running out, you must find a refueling pad to land on. These pads also serve as your starting points when you've died. Copta Snatch uses a quite uncommon \"semigraphics\" mode to great effect, similar to the Tandy title Protector II.", "platform": "Dragon 32/64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Blaby Computer Games", "publishers": "Blaby Computer Games", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EysJf_Xap74", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/121314-copta-snatch\n"}
