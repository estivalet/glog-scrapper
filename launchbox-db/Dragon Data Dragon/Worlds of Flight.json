{"altername_name": [], "name": "Worlds of Flight", "overview": "Worlds of Flight is a civilian flight simulator depicting a single engine trainer aircraft, limited aerobatics capable, and equipped with steerable and retractable gear. The scenery is organized in 9 adjoining maps called 'worlds' plus a common airport scenery that recurs on every map. The views are drawn as wire graphics to save memory, and you can cross from one map to another to make longer flights. The worlds/maps have 3D objects like towers and mountains that needs to be avoided or navigated by, and there are beacons that let you use IFR instruments to find the airports. There is a 'radar' view to help check your position on the map in IMC training. The game starts with setting the weather in the worlds, with winds/cloud ceilings and then you move to the aircraft at the airport. Your view is from inside the cockpit, and to look around the view can be shifted 90 degrees to either side, and 8 degrees up relative to the aircraft orientation/pitch. In steep climbs the view/head angle is adjusted (to a limit) to try and keep the horizon visible. The Worlds are called: Mountain World #1, Arabian Gulf, Panama City, Dahlgren VA, Practice Field, Mountain World #2, Island Bay, Mountain World #3, Power Line River. The airport scenery is loaded whenever you get close enough, below the ceiling/400ft and about 4000ft from the runway threshold.", "platform": "Dragon 32/64", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tom Mix Software", "publishers": "Microdeal", "genres": "Flight Simulator", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86163-worlds-of-flight\n"}
