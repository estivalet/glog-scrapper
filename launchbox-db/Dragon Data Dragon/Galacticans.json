{"altername_name": [], "name": "Galacticans", "overview": "Galacticans is a 1 - 2 player arcade game for multiple systems. It is a clone of Galaxians. The player controls a small ship which moves laterally on the bottom of the screen, and fires vertically forwards. A large convoy of alien ships moves laterally at the top of the screen, and enemy vessels intermittently break from formation and swoop towards the player firing their lasers. The player tries to destroy all enemy vessels before the timer at the top of the screen runs out. The player starts with 5 vessels, and it's game over when all are destroyed.", "platform": "Dragon 32/64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Rainbow Software", "publishers": "Softek International", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/125973-galacticans\n"}
