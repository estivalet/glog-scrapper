{"altername_name": [], "name": "UXB", "overview": "In UXB the player is given the task of defusing an old unexploded war-time bomb. The game is menu based and played with keyboard. First the player has to choose the right items from his toolkit. Due to limited space in the vicinity of the bomb he can only carry six of these twelve items: small spanner, copper hammer, cold chisel, special fluid, sidecutters, stethoscope, socket set, pliers, hydraulic jack, special spanner, insulating tape and small screwdriver. If the player picks more than six items the bomb will go off right away. There is no way to dump an item so it's necessary to pick the right ones from the start. Before starting to work, the bomb can be examined from three views: side, nose and hatch. When working on the bomb the player is presented with a menu of five options (for example move bomb or unscrew nosecap). The player has to pick the right option and then the right tool. Picking the wrong combination leads to the bomb going off while picking the right one leads to the player advancing to the next menu (with new options) and everything repeats until the bomb has been defused. If stuck the player can type HELP to get a hint on how to proceed. When the bomb goes off the player is given the choice to restart from the last move or from the beginning.", "platform": "Dragon 32/64", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Patrick Fisher", "publishers": "Virgin Games", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/125693-uxb\n"}
