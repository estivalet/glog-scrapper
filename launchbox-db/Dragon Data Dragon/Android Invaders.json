{"altername_name": [], "name": "Android Invaders", "overview": "Android Invaders is a 1-player arcade game for the Dragon 32/64. The player's task is to defend their planet from the invasion fleet of Zorg, who are using androids to spearhead the attack. The player controls a small ship that moves laterally at the bottom of the screen and fires vertically upwards. Androids move as a group laterally across the screen until they reach the edge, move down a small amount, and then move back again. Androids intermittently fire back at the player, and as the androids get destroyed, the remaining ones begin to move faster. Four barriers provide protection from incoming fire. A green alien mothership intermittently moves across the top of the screen. If this crosses unscathed, then the androids become invisible. Shooting a red mothership will make the androids visible again. Skill levels range from 1 to 8.", "platform": "Dragon 32/64", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Lyversoft", "publishers": "Lyversoft", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHyT0pEDwOc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/125511-android-invaders\n"}
