{"altername_name": [], "name": "Destroyer", "overview": "Destroyer, the World War II Battleship simulator, allows you take command over a Fletcher Class U.S. Naval Destroyer. Sounds like fun? It is! Destroyer begins by asking what your name is, as the Captain, and what the name of your vessel will be. You then choose which mission to take, after which a description of the selected mission is given. You command the ship from its many different sections. Here is a list of the commands you have to type in to move to all the stations of the ship: BR Bridge NA Navigation OB Observation Deck RA Radar SO Sonar GF, GA Guns Forward/Guns Aft AP, AS Anti-Aircraft Guns Port/Starboard TP, TS Torpedoes Port/Starboard DC Depth Charges DA Damage Control Also - TR To use targeting radar when using forward and aft guns AB Abandon Ship (when all else fails) Control is achieved either with keypad or joystick, open apple being the fire button (though option works as well). Keep an eye on the scrolling messages, such as radar or sonar reports otherwise you won't know what hits you! I think that's all I have to tell you...half the fun will be discovering what all the knobs and switches do in the various sections of the ship. Destroyer has fair graphics, the animation is nice and colourful but it's another of those games ported to the IIGS with a mix of hi-res and lo-res graphics. Crank the volume when you play this game however - the explosion sound effects are excellent!", "platform": "Apple IIGS", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Epyx", "genres": "Vehicle Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.9", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destroyer_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86896-destroyer\n"}
