The player controls a barbarian warrior who has embarked on a quest to slay a dragon. While on his way to the dragon's lair, Rastan must fight hordes of enemy monsters based on mythical creatures such as chimeras and harpies. The Apple IIGS port developed by Novalogic and published by Taito in 1990 is particularly notable for being one of the most accurate arcade conversions of any of the home computers in the same period.", "platform": "Apple IIGS", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Novalogic", "publishers": "Taito", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.71", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rastan_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-peNZxUpw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83476-rastan\n"}
