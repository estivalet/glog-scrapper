{"altername_name": [], "name": "Defender of the Crown", "overview": "Defender of the Crown is a strategy computer game designed by Kellyn Beck. It was Cinemaware's first game, and was originally released for the Commodore Amiga in 1986, setting a new standard for graphic quality in home computer games. In 1987 it was ported to MS-DOS, the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), Atari ST, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, Macintosh and finally, the Apple IIGS in 1988. It was later ported to the CD-i. The game is set in England in 1149 during the Middle Ages where, following the death of the king, different factions are fighting for territorial control. The player assumes the role of a Saxon (Wilfred of Ivanhoe, Cedric of Rotherwood, Geoffrey Longsword or Wolfric the Wild) and tries to fight off the Norman hordes and wrestle for control of England. Eventually, the player must fight for control of all territories, and potentially those controlled by other Saxons, if they have become antagonistic. The player must amass armies and fight for control of opponents' castles. The player may engage enemy armies in battle, loot or lay siege to opposing castles. Territories can also be won in the periodic jousting contests. From time to time the player may attempt to rescue a damsel in distress and can appeal for help from the legendary bandit Robin Hood. The game's strategy boils down to a war of attrition as the player tries to amass larger armies than his opponents and manages to attack their territories at the right time.", "platform": "Apple IIGS", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Cinemaware", "publishers": "Cinemaware", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.78", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_IavbEosQk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/74994-defender-of-the-crown\n"}
