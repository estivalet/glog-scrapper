{"altername_name": [], "name": "Charlie Brown's ABC's", "overview": "Charlie Brown\u2019s ABCs is a simple educational game aimed at children ages 4 to 7. The game is intended to teach both the alphabet as well as the location of letters on the keyboard. The main screen of the game shows the entire alphabet with both uppercase and lowercase letters. When a letter is pressed, an animation of a Peanuts character interacting with an object starting with that letter appears, accompanied by music. For example, if the letter \u2018K\u2019 is pressed then an animation of Charlie Brown flying a kite will appear. Similar to Odyssey games such as Roulette, States, this game utilizes peripherals and was packaged with 10 learning activities and a set of flash cards.", "platform": "Apple IIGS", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "David Lubar", "publishers": "Random House", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/131629-charlie-browns-abcs\n"}
