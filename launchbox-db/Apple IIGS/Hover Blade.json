{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hover Blade", "overview": "Hover Blade is an action game that uses a chase view similar to Buck Rogers: Planet of Zoom and Space Harrier. The game involves steering a hovercraft with the mouse as it automatically moves forward and the objective is to reach the end without crashing. The path ahead is full of various obstacles such as trees, bushes and structures which has to be avoided since collisions leads to a loss of power. When all out of power the craft will be destroyed. The craft also has a limited amount of fuel and it's necessary to collect fuel canisters to refill. Missiles can be used to destroy obstacles but come in limited supply. To recharge the missiles the craft has to fly through a black sphere. The player will also come across gates that when flown through gives bonus points once a level has been completed.", "platform": "Apple IIGS", "release_date": "September 17, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "MCX", "publishers": "MCX", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEqpquxLmKI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86915-hover-blade\n"}
