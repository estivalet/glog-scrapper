{"altername_name": [], "name": "Airball", "overview": "This is one of the earliest isometric action games that is reminiscent of Marble Madness in look and feel, but with much more complex controls and gameplay. You've been turned into a ball (!) by an evil wizard, and must find the spellbook spell ingredients to turn back to human before the air runs out. Lots of traps and monsters give a strong RPG flavor to this essentially maze-navigating and trap-avoiding action game. Airball for Apple IIgs saw an extremely limited run with fewer than 150 sales for the platform.", "platform": "Apple IIGS", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Microdeal", "publishers": "Microdeal", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airball_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt8G2lWNl1U", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/47386-airball\n"}
