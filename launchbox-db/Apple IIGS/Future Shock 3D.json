{"altername_name": [], "name": "Future Shock 3D", "overview": "Future Shock 3D is rather unique action/arcade game for the IIGS. It was to go hand in hand with a new gaming peripheral, the Future Pad. The Future Pad was shaped like a mouse pad and it calculated the distance of the player's hand from the device. The game is somewhat similar to Marble Madness; your goal is to move a metal ball through an obstacle course. You move the ball with the mouse and jump with the future pad. Until recently, without the Future Pad, Future Shock was nothing more than a collectible piece of novelty software. The game ships with demo mode, so you can at least see how the game should be played. However the community has recently patched the game to replace Future Pad with a joystick, making the game playable for those of us without the peripheral.", "platform": "Apple IIGS", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Jeffrey Johnson", "publishers": "Neeka Electronics", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/141077-future-shock-3d\n"}
