{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sword of Sodan", "overview": "Sword of Sodan is a hack and slash video game originally released for the Amiga in 1988 by Discovery Software. A partially completed port for the Apple IIGS was advertised and shown at the CES Expo in 1989 by Visual Concepts It was approximately 70% complete. Soon after, a three level self-playing demo was released and displayed in stores, virtually indistinguishable from the Amiga version in terms of graphics and animation fluidity. Discovery Software went bankrupt soon after in 1990. Despite these developments, appearing in magazines ads, on display in stores and the game being included on vendor's price lists, the port remained in limbo and never released. Nearly 30 years later, on May 26, 2018, the unreleased Apple IIGS port was unearthed and made public, revealing an entirely playable and very polished version of the game. It was revealed all levels are present, however four (primarily castle areas) are missing enemy sprites or obstacles\u2013in addition to the final boss stage. The Apple IIGS source code required to complete programming of the game has still yet to be found.", "platform": "Apple IIGS", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Visual Concepts", "publishers": "Discovery Software International", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.58", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword_of_Sodan#Unreleased_Apple_IIGS_port", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCi_khqsJ-E", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86998-sword-of-sodan\n"}
