{"altername_name": [], "name": "Marble Madness", "overview": "Marble Madness is an isometric platform game where the player manipulates an onscreen marble from a third-person perspective. The player controls the marble's movements with a trackball, though most home versions use game controllers with directional pads. The aim of the game is for the player to traverse six maze-like, isometric courses before a set amount of time expires. Each course has its own time limit, with the remaining time left over from completing a course added to the succeeding one.", "platform": "Apple IIGS", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Will Harvey", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.7", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marble_Madness", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKMHXIIgsCY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83474-marble-madness\n"}
