{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Tinies", "overview": "The Tinies was originally developed by Atried Concept, where Olivier Goguel and Olivier Bailly-Maitre of the FTA went to work after they decided to call it a day on the IIGS. I imagine they were sympathetic to Brutal Deluxe porting the game to the IIGS and releasing it as freeware. The Tinies is a game of strategy and puzzle solving. You select the Tinies, personable, coloured, furry creatures, with a marquee controlled via the keyboard. With a Tiny selected, you can move them up, down, left and right but they will only stop if there's an obstacle in their way. You can also hit the action key to make the Tinies interact with various objects in the environment", "platform": "Apple IIGS", "release_date": "September 18, 1994", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "", "developers": "Brutal Deluxe Software", "publishers": "Brutal Deluxe Software", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujY_YzzvhGY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/87011-the-tinies\n"}
