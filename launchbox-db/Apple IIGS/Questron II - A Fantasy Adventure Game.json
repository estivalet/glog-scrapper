{"altername_name": ["Questron II"], "name": "Questron II: A Fantasy Adventure Game", "overview": "The premise of this game is that the player's character has been sent back in time to defeat six \"Mad Sorcerers\" before they can create the \"Book of Magic\" featured in the original game. As the second title in the Questron series, this game follows the same basic formula as the original. You start out as a lowly peasant with only a few gold coins in your pocket and a bad attitude to defend yourself. By stumbling around the countryside and fighting hordes of creatures, you gain wealth, experience, and title. Questron II spans two continents, Landor and the Realm of Sorcerers. Additionally, there are the requisite tombs, castles, and dungeons. In the first Questron, your goal was to defeat the evil Wizard Mantor. Now, in Questron II, the good Wizard Mesron has sent you back in time before the Book of Magic was created. Your goal is to defeat the six Mad Sorcerers before they can create the book.", "platform": "Apple IIGS", "release_date": "September 19, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Strategic Simulations", "publishers": "Strategic Simulations", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questron_II", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/87061-questron-ii-a-fantasy-adventure-game\n"}
