{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dark Castle", "overview": "Dark Castle was originally created for the Macintosh in black and white in 1986. Some years later an Amiga version appeared and later still the IIGS version arrived, being released in 1989 by Three Sixty. Dark Castle is an action adventure game where both the mouse and keyboard are used to achieve control. Keyboard configuration will allow use of a customised key set-up. The Keyboard is used to move your character around, run, jump etc. while the mouse is used for aiming and throwing stones to knock out your enemies. You'll also interact with certain objects in the surrounding environment to overcome your obstacles. A slightly more complicated way of interaction back in the 80s but one that is now commonplace by way of keyboard and mouse combinations with today's first person shooter games.", "platform": "Apple IIGS", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Silicon Beach Software", "publishers": "Three-Sixty Pacific", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.62", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Castle", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r70tIXr5yXM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/74993-dark-castle\n"}
