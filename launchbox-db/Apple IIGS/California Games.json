{"altername_name": [], "name": "California Games", "overview": "California Games is a 1987 Epyx sports video game for many home computers and video game consoles. Branching from their popular Summer Games and Winter Games series, this game consisted of some sports purportedly popular in California including skateboarding, freestyle footbag, surfing, roller skating, flying disc (frisbee) and BMX. The game was followed in 1991 by California Games II, but the sequel failed to match the original's success.", "platform": "Apple IIGS", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Designer Software", "publishers": "Epyx", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "8", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.44", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JVvQd66r8Y", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/47391-california-games\n"}
