{"altername_name": [], "name": "Space Fox", "overview": "Space Fox is a 1-player side-scrolling space shooter for the Apple IIgs. The player controls a small spaceship which can move in all directions and fires forwards, as they fight their way through a number of progressively more difficult alien levels. Enemy ships approach in waves, and when one group is destroyed, typically powerups are dropped, which include fuel, shields, and more powerful weapons. The player has limited fuel for each level, and if this runs out, a life is lost. Each level has a final boss battle, and a supply depot, which the player can dock with to load a new weapon or purchase other supplies. The ship is also armed with a limited shield supply, which can be used to temporarily make the vessel invulnerable to alien attack.", "platform": "Apple IIGS", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bright Software", "publishers": "Seven Hills Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/87009-space-fox\n"}
