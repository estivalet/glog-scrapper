{"altername_name": [], "name": "Superstar Ice Hockey", "overview": "In Superstar Ice Hockey you control one of 20 NHL teams. The game has no license so you can't play with the stars. There are 4 groups with 5 teams. After the regular season the best 2 teams of every group are qualified for the playoffs. Worth mentioning is that you are playing always the center - the other players are controlled by the CPU. In the multiplayer mode you can only play friendly games.", "platform": "Apple IIGS", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "DesignStar Consultants", "publishers": "Mindscape", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superstar_Ice_Hockey", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TnKbYs_poM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86999-superstar-ice-hockey\n"}
