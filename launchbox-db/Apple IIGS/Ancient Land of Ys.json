{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ancient Land of Ys", "overview": "The back story of Ys is dripping with metaphor: the land was once peaceful and happy, but when a farmer discovered a precious magic metal called \"kureria\" (the uses are left vague), the land was stricken with sudden wealth, income inequality, and natural disasters. Sick of the destruction, the people of Ys gathered up all the kureria, stuffed it into a vault in the Holy Shrine of Sarumon (yes, really), and erected magic statues to guard it. Things returned to normal. But man years later, an evil wizard named Malificus has seized the six Books of Ys, which hold the secret to kureria and has taken the metal. \"Only by recovering the six Books of Ys can the people hope to regain their land and end the evil reign of Malificus.\" But five of the books are being guarded by \"huge monsters\" and Malificus himself holds the sixth.", "platform": "Apple IIGS", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nihon Falcom", "publishers": "Kyodai Software Marketing", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.05", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ys_I:_Ancient_Ys_Vanished", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/47356-ancient-land-of-ys\n"}
