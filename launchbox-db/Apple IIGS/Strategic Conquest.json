{"altername_name": [], "name": "Strategic Conquest", "overview": "Strategic Conquest is a military themed 1 - 2 player strategy game with the goal to conquer the world. Allows for 1-player versus computer, 2-player, and 2-player games via modem. Computer difficulty ranges from 1 - 15. The players compete to control a map of randomly placed islands in a grid, with the player who eliminates the other being declared the winner. Each player starts with 1 city, which can produce a variety of unique units including army, fighter, destroyer, submarine, transport, carrier, battleship, and bomber. Each unit takes a different number of days to produce, and units have individual strengths, weaknesses, and movement abilities. Players attempt to control as many cities as possible, as each city increases the production capacity of their forces. A fog of war is in place, and at the beginning of each game the player only knows the surrounding terrain. Enemy units can't be seen unless close to the player.", "platform": "Apple IIGS", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "PBI Software", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/129539-strategic-conquest\n"}
