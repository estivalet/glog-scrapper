{"altername_name": [], "name": "Out of This World", "overview": "Another World, also known as Out of This World in North America, is a 1991 cinematic platformer action-adventure game designed by \u00c9ric Chahi and published by Delphine Software. The game tells a story of Lester, a young scientist who, as a result of an experiment gone wrong, finds himself on a dangerous alien world where he is forced to fight for his survival. Another World was developed by Chahi alone over a period of about two years, with help with the soundtrack from Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Freitas. Chahi developed his own game engine, completing all the game's art and animations in vector form to reduce memory use, with some use of rotoscoping to help plan out character movements. Both narratively and gameplay-wise, he wanted the game to be told with little to no language or user-interface elements. The game was originally developed for the Amiga and Atari ST but has since been widely ported to other contemporary systems, including home and portable consoles and mobile devices. Chahi has since overseen release of various anniversary releases of the game. Another World was innovative in its use of cinematic effects in both real-time and cutscenes, which earned the game praise among critics and commercial success. It also influenced a number of other video games and designers, inspiring such titles as Ico, Metal Gear Solid, Silent Hill, and Delphine's later Flashback.", "platform": "Apple IIGS", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Interplay", "publishers": "Interplay", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.88", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Another_World_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oITzeb-4eXc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/84491-out-of-this-world\n"}
