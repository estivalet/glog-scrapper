{"altername_name": ["Magic Johnson's Fast Break"], "name": "Magic Johnson's Basketball", "overview": "Magic Johnson's Fast Break (alternatively titled Magic Johnson's Basketball) is a side-scrolling basketball sports game developed by Arcadia Systems and published in 1988. The game features the name and likeness of Los Angeles Lakers point guard Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson Jr., and was endorsed by PepsiCo. In 1990 Tradewest published Software Creations' adaptation of the game for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). It was one of several celebrity-endorsed sports games published by Tradewest, and was promoted with a television advertisement campaign. An adaptation to the Apple IIGS was abandoned and never published. Virgin Interactive released another basketball game featuring Johnson, Super Slam Dunk, in 1993. The game features two generic basketball teams. Most versions of the game have one- and two-player modes. The NES version is one of a handful of NES software titles to support three- and four-player simultaneous play using either the NES Satellite or NES Four Score console accessories. The multiplayer modes allow competition in single games, but there is no tournament play.", "platform": "Apple IIGS", "release_date": "September 18, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Arcadia Systems", "publishers": "Melbourne House", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.83", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Johnson%27s_Fast_Break", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/87016-magic-johnsons-basketball\n"}
