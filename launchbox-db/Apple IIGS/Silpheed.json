{"altername_name": [], "name": "Silpheed", "overview": "Silpheed is a vertical-scrolling shooter video game. It is presented at an oblique view camera angle, with enemies and other objects becoming smaller as they move towards the top of the screen. The player assumes the role of a starship named the SA-08 Silpheed, deployed by the Yggdrassil supercomputer to destroy the Xacalite terrorist organization. The Silpheed can freely move about the screen. In each level, the player is tasked with destroying various enemies while avoiding their projectiles. By shooting down red-colored orbs found throughout levels, the player can acquire one of five different weapon types, each with their own unique behavior and strengths; these include homing missiles, an auto-aiming shot, and a \"phanlax\" spread-shot laser. Weapons can be attached to either side of the Silpheed.", "platform": "Apple IIGS", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Game Arts", "publishers": "Game Arts", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.78", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silpheed", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98xKZk5FOk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/74996-silpheed\n"}
