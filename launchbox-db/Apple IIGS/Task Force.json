{"altername_name": [], "name": "Task Force", "overview": "Crime has risen to unprecedented levels. Criminal organizations have banded together - all under the leadership of Hector Vasquez, the mastermind behind it all. It is up to Joe Baxter and Michael Dvorak, tough cops from New York and Chicago respectively, to eliminate all the goons and henchmen of the mobs, until they can go after Vasquez himself - with whom the two have a personal beef they'd love to settle. The game itself is a side-scrolling shoot-'em-up that can be played with one or two players simultaneously. In five major US cities, all the enemies must be taken out using different weapons like flame throwers, tazers, uzis, rocket launchers, and grenades.", "platform": "Apple IIGS", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Visual Concepts", "publishers": "FanFare", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_Force_1942", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IboV2podVDY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86997-task-force\n"}
