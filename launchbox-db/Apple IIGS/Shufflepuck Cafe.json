{"altername_name": [], "name": "Shufflepuck Cafe", "overview": "Shufflepuck Caf\u00e9 is a computer air hockey game developed by Christopher Gross, Gene Portwood and Lauren Elliott for Br\u00f8derbund. Originally developed for the Macintosh, it was later adapted by Br\u00f8derbund for other platforms; however, the IIGS version was never officially released from beta phase. This air hockey style game pits the player versus the computer over 'Cantina Band' inspired music. Deflect the puck around the walled area using your bat, trying to knock it into your opponent's goal. There are several computer competitors, from which some of them definitely cheat. However, you can cheat as well, as you can resize your stick to fill the whole table width, or add one in the middle, and see who breaks glass first. There are single plays or the tournament where you play opponents in order of difficulty. The winner is the one who reaches 15 glass breaks first.", "platform": "Apple IIGS", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Br\u00f8derbund Software", "publishers": "Br\u00f8derbund Software", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shufflepuck_Caf%C3%A9", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2nC39rx2n4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83478-shufflepuck-cafe\n"}
