{"altername_name": [], "name": "Strip Poker: A Sizzling Game of Chance", "overview": "\"Welcome to Strip Poker!\" The girls shout when it finishes loading and you're brought before the main menu. Why this game is recognised as a sequel is beyond me because apart from updated graphics and sound it's the same game as the 1982 8-bit Apple II version. Even down to the simple credits: by Roger Harnish. Even both the girls are the same: Suzi and Melissa. Unlike the 1982 original the girls have been scanned and not drawn. This is going to sound a trite too critical, but neither Suzi nor Melissa aren't what you'd call classic beauties. Sure, maybe they have nice personalities that make 'em beautiful, but you aren't going to be engaged in any deep philosophical conversations while you're playing cards in this game to find out.", "platform": "Apple IIGS", "release_date": "September 18, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Artworx Software Company", "publishers": "Artworx Software Company", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/87002-strip-poker-a-sizzling-game-of-chance\n"}
