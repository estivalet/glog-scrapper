{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tower of Myraglen", "overview": "In Tower of Myraglen, the player must make it through the tower to retrieve a medallion while also defeating an evil king. The Medallion, a soul stealing artifact, was created by the young prodigy magician named Mendalick. The medallion made Mendalick age. Being too feeble to use it himself, he hid it in a rock of the Tower of Myraglen. After some time a king had an adventurer enter the tower to retrieve the medallion for him under the guise of it being for everyone's safety. The king then killed the adventurer and established himself as a despot of the land in the tower. Throughout the game the player has to find clues, fight monsters, and make decisions of both moral and strategic nature.", "platform": "Apple IIGS", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Richard L.
