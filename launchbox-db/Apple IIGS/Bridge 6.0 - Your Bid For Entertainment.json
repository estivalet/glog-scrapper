The game takes advantage of the advanced graphics and sound capabilities of the Apple IIgs. This specific Bridge series was the longest continuously published bridge games for computers.

It was first released to the public as Bridge 2.0 in 1978 and when Artworx was started, it was updated to Bridge 3.0. At various times, it was available for the Apple II, TRS-80, Atari (8-bit and ST), North Star, CP/M, Commodore Pet, VIC 20, Commodore 64, Amiga, Macintosh and PC. Bridge 2.0 and 3.0 had to fit in just 8K of RAM to run on those early computers.", "platform": "Apple IIGS", "release_date": "September 17, 1989", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Artworx Software Company", "publishers": "Artworx Software Company", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.11", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86892-bridge-60-your-bid-for-entertainment\n"}
