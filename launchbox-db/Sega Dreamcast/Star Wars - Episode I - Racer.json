{"altername_name": ["Star Wars - Episode I Racer"], "name": "Star Wars: Episode I: Racer", "overview": "At last! The first Star Wars game for the 128-bit Dreamcast lets you participate in the famous podrace sequence (which was the critical highlight of the 1999 film Star Wars: Episode I, The Phantom Menace). These lightning-quick vehicles are capable of reaching simulated speeds of up to 600 miles per hour, while skimming a mere 4 feet above the ground. You can race alone or against a friend in split-screen mode, on over more than 21 courses among eight worlds. Take the controls as Jedi-to-be Anakin Skywalker, or any one of over 20 podracers, and feel the full-force blast--while avoiding hazards such as methane lakes, meteor showers, and the unfriendly Tusken Raiders.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "April 4, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "LucasArts Entertainment", "publishers": "LucasArts Entertainment", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.03", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Episode_I:_Racer", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/10668-star-wars-episode-i-racer\n"}
