A funny preface that breaks the fourth wall with the complicity of the player and sets the stage for what will eventually be revealed in the final game. We know this is a short and cute experience, but we are sure that many Dreamcast fans wish to acquire it before the arrival of Non Casual Encounter.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "2021", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "SEGASaturno Productions", "publishers": "SEGASaturno Productions", "genres": "Visual Novel", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165183-non-casual-encounter-prologue\n"}
