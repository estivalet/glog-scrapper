{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ultimate Fighting Championship", "overview": "Ultimate Fighting Championship is based on the no-holds-barred martial art tournament of the same name. What makes the game (and the real-life counterpart) distinct from wrestling, boxing, and other fights is the variety of fighting styles in use; it is perfectly possible to end up with a judo master facing a kickboxer. The actual gameplay is simple enough. You have various basic moves, combos, holds, and so on. The complications come in the form of the huge list of moves, featuring many different styles. Hit your opponent until he gets knocked out, or force him to tap out early.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "August 29, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Anchor", "publishers": "Crave Entertainment", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.96", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/7472-ultimate-fighting-championship\n"}
