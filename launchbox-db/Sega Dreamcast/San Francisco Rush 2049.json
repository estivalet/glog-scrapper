{"altername_name": [], "name": "San Francisco Rush 2049", "overview": "San Francisco, with its steep hills and winding streets, has always been one of the most inhospitable cities for driving--at least for those who follow traffic laws. In San Francisco Rush 2049, you'll use Baghdad by the Bay's unique terrain to your advantage in aggressive racing that takes place decades into the future. Use strategically placed jumps to get past the competition. The Dreamcast version of the game features 19 tracks and 13 customizable cars. You'll choose between different race modes, including stunt, obstacle, and battle match, where up to four players simultaneously fight (literally) for the finish.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "September 7, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Atari", "publishers": "Midway", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.88", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Rush_2049", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/10682-san-francisco-rush-2049\n"}
