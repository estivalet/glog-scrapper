{"altername_name": ["Dynamite Deka 2", "Dynamite Cop"], "name": "Dynamite Cop!", "overview": "Fresh from the arcades, Dynamite Cop is a no-holds-barred, fast-action fighting game that will keep you entertained from the moment you power up your Dreamcast. The game begins with the kidnapping of the president's daughter on a cruise ship. Your goal is to rescue her from a gang of strange-looking thugs by kicking, punching, and shooting your way through multiple environments of the cruise ship. While single-player action is adequate, this game truly shines during the dual-player mode. With enemies attacking from every possible angle, the onscreen action can be overwhelming at times. Almost anything onscreen can be used as a weapon--and we do mean anything. For example, in one scene the fighting takes place in a public restroom. Let's just say that the urinals on the wall make wonderful weapons. Other innovative weapons include a vacuum cleaner, a couch, and--egad!--even a fish!", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "October 31, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.19", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamite_Cop", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCoSq0ha_ho", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/402-dynamite-cop\n"}
