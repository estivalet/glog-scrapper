{"altername_name": ["Killer Loop"], "name": "MagForce Racing", "overview": "If you need an adrenaline rush, Killer Loop might be just your thing: Step into your magnetic glider and race through lots of roller-coaster like tracks full of curves and loops, psyched up by pumping techno beats. There are of course power-ups scattered on the track that may be picked up, including weapon systems to get rid of your enemies. Similar to Wipeout, this is a game for speed freaks.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "July 21, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "VCC Entertainment", "publishers": "Crave", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.56", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_Loop", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/29316-magforce-racing\n"}
