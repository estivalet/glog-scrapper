{"altername_name": [], "name": "4 Wheel Thunder", "overview": "4 Wheel Thunder is the off-road racing sequel to the power-boat racing game Hydro Thunder. In this game, players race around two types of courses; huge outdoor tracks and smaller indoor tracks. All in all, there are 24 areas in which to race, including various day/night and rain/sunshine variations. The game includes the standard championship, practice race, and two player modes. The Thunder series of games is unique in that the key to winning the race lies not in careful steering and braking, instead focusing more in finding the boost power-ups that lie around the tracks. Each boost icon adds a few seconds of time to your boost meter. The player then can press a boost button to increase the speed of the truck dramatically. Without using boost power-ups, the player has no chance of winning a race.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "May 4, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Kalisto Entertainment", "publishers": "Midway Games", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.29", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_Wheel_Thunder", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_qjkEfxmIo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/18716-4-wheel-thunder\n"}
