{"altername_name": [], "name": "Himitsu: Yui ga Ita Natsu", "overview": "The game revolves around a promise you made with a girl as a young boy, to meet each other when you grow older, and a secret that has been kept for all these years. While there are many heroines included, this game's premise is more that of a mystery novel than a romance. The story takes place in present time during your reunion with your childhood friends, as well as during past time during your childhood days. The art style in this game is rather unique in comparison to typical visual novel anime art style. The background art uses somewhat a mix of a life-like re-touched images and anime drawings. While characters use voice-acting in this Dreamcast exclusive visual novel, the animation is non-existent during dialogues. The bonus content features unlockable heroine albums which can be accessed via main menu.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "July 26, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Starfish", "publishers": "Starfish", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/107835-himitsu-yui-ga-ita-natsu\n"}
