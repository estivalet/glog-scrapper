{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sakura Taisen 4: Koi seyo, Otome", "overview": "SIn the fourth installment of the Sakura Taisen series, Ichiro Ogami returns to Japan after having defeated the evil that threatened Paris. Something is once again wrong in the Imperial Capital, as two street cars go berserk without any reason, saved only by the mech-commanding girls of the Hanagumi Brigade. The girls from Paris Kagekidan return to join forces with the original cast, to help Ichiro defeat evil one more time. Sakura Taisen 4 utilizes the same gameplay mechanics as its predecessor, including a virtually identical combat scheme. As always, you have to choose and time your responses well to attract the attention of one of the lovely girls you command. Unlike the three previous games, this game is not divided into chapters.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "March 21, 2002", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Red Entertainment Corporation, Overworks", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.57", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/96556-sakura-taisen-4-koi-seyo-otome\n"}
