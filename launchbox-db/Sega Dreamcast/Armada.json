{"altername_name": [], "name": "Armada", "overview": "Armada is a video game that was released for the Sega Dreamcast in 1999. Earth has been destroyed by the unfathomable Armada, giant space aliens of unknown origin with unknown purpose. Fleeing in whatever was available, humanity took to the stars in a desperate attempt to survive. Eons later, humans have split into 6 distinct groups who maintain a shaky alliance against the Armada. An Asteroids-like RPG, Armada was a sci-fi shooter that allowed 1-4 players to fly about the universe, fighting the enemy, performing missions and improving their ship. The player would gather credits to buy power-ups for their ship, allowing them to voyage deeper into enemy territory, blow up ever more powerful Armada, and perform missions of increasing importance and danger as the alliance fights not only for answers as to why the Armada attack, but for their very lives.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "November 26, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Metro3D", "publishers": "Metro3D", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.54", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armada_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/3353-armada\n"}
