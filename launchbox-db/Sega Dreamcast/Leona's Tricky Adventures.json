{"altername_name": [], "name": "Leona's Tricky Adventures", "overview": "Accompany Leona in a clever puzzle adventure to save the inhabitants of a strange but lovely world. Featuring fresh puzzle mechanics, wonderful retro graphics, lots of exploration and an excellent soundtrack by legendary game composer Chris Huelsbeck. Leona\u2019s Tricky Adventures is inspired by a clever puzzle game mechanic which was briefly explored in the very early 90s but sadly faded from prominence shortly after. The basic task is to match two increasingly complex patterns using increasingly complex mechanics. While it can\u2019t be directly compared to any contemporary game the mental skills required by the puzzles put them somewhere in between \"Picross\" and \"Bejeweled\" \u2013 and in our humble opinion they can easily stand up against those games. All puzzles are embedded in a big and complex overworld full of exploration and humorous citizens constructed entirely using beautifully hand-drawn pixel graphics. Exploration and puzzle-solving is intertwined in clever and varied ways which draw you deeper into the game world.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "January 26, 2016", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "KTX Software", "publishers": "Signo & Arte", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP4vMOxmp7k", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106209-leonas-tricky-adventures\n"}
