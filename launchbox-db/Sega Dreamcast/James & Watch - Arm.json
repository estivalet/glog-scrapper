{"altername_name": [], "name": "James & Watch: Arm", "overview": "As an indie title produced by one person, James & Watch: Arm is light on the presentation, but what it does have is charm - and spades of it. Playing on the events of the fateful summer in 1972, you take control of youngest brother Mike as he is thrown through the air, and at certain points in his flight path you get the option to alter his course either left or right. By judging where the randomly positioned older brothers are located at the bottom of the screen, you get thrown back into the air and repeat the process. Every time you successfully land on one of the brothers, you gain a point. Miss though, and you land in a crumpled heap on the grass and receive one broken limb. Land three times...and it's game over. As Ben succinctly put it - you only have two arms! Arm is pretty basic in other respects - it has only one screen and simplistic (albeit authentic) sound effects, but it does feature VMU graphics and VGA support.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "2012", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ben Lancaster", "publishers": "Ben Lancaster", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/124239-james-watch-arm\n"}
