{"altername_name": [], "name": "deSPIRIA", "overview": "deSpiria is an RPG adventure that takes place in the futuristic Japan of 2070. Twenty-two years after the World War III, an organization known as Church has taken power. You play as Allure Valentine, a girl who was recruited by the Church as an undercover agent. On one of her missions, Allure boards a train that crashes shortly thereafter. Her first task will be to find a way out of the underground tunnel and to discover who or what was behind that crash. The game is a RPG with elements of pure adventure. The entire game is viewed from first-person perspective. You fight enemies in turn-based battles, but instead of usual party you have several \"minds\", a kind of summoned monsters who will fight together with Allure. They will heal or attack the enemy using special \"mind attacks\" of various elements - love, curse, etc. In adventure mode, you explore the environments by pressing the A button, which will highlight objects you can interact with. The movements are shown as short CG sequences, similar to many Western-style adventures.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "September 12, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dennou Eizo Seisakusho", "publishers": "Atlus", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/107822-despiria\n"}
