A demo was released for Dreamcast containing the game's first mission but by late 2018, promotion of the game halted without a full release. The game was licensed by Studio Pierrot and based on the 1987 television series of the same name, which is an American adaptation of a 1984 anime that was reworked and originally syndicated by World Events Productions (WEP) in Japan.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "April 20, 2017", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "", "developers": "Team Saber Rider", "publishers": "Team Saber Rider", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/155188-saber-rider-and-the-star-sheriffs\n"}
