{"altername_name": ["Fish Life in Amazon", "Fish Life: Amazon: Playful Edition"], "name": "Fish Life: Amazon", "overview": "Fish Life is a simulation of a fish tank with an added touch screen, allowing users to interact with virtual fish. Users can call the fishes (fishes will react to users voice causing a number of reactions on the fishes like happiness, anger, sadness) , feed the fishes and watch them grow, draw in the screen (users can draw a fish and watch it being followed by the other fishes while moving it), when users touch a fish his name and species are displayed and it's even possible to play music when touching the fish as if they were piano keys. While designed to be placed in an arcade environment, it is not an arcade game, instead being designed as \"interior d\u00e9cor\" or \"healing art\". Fish Life is free to play but has no goals and never \"ends\", instead acting more of a distraction. It does not accept currency and loops endlessly to relieve boredom. The \"Amazon\" version is themed after the Amazon River, featuring wildlife from that region.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "August 6, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega AM5", "publishers": "Sega Corporation", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZNR2PE48no", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165900-fish-life-amazon\n"}
