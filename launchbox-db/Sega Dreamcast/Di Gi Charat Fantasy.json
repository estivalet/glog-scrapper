{"altername_name": [], "name": "Di Gi Charat Fantasy", "overview": "The player takes the role of a young boy who one day gets sucked into a fantasy world along with his friends after Dejiko's battle went all wrong. Upon arriving to a new world, you find yourself with a forest with Dejiko who seems to have sudden amnesia, and her typical frenzy-self is replaced with somewhat reluctant and shy persona. Originally released for PC (Windows) in 2001, the Dreamcast port got out later that same year. A couple of years later, the PlayStation 2 version got out under the title Di Gi Charat Fantasy Excellent with additional content. This visual novel features voice-acting as well as opening and in-game animated cut-scenes, but does not feature any unlockable content typical to most of visual novels. Also, the dialogue text cannot be hidden in order to see unobscured background image. The game does not feature a map of the new world you got sucked into, but lets you select from the list of locations you wish to visit from an overview of the new place you're in. Along with Dejiko, you'll visit new places, talk to new people, and hopefully her amnesia will come to pass and you'll find your way back home together.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "September 6, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Broccoli", "publishers": "Broccoli", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/107823-di-gi-charat-fantasy\n"}
