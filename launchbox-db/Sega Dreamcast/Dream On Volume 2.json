{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dream On Volume 2", "overview": "Dream On Volume 2 is a Sega Dreamcast demo disc distributed in Europe as part of the Dream On series. It was sold with issue #1 of the UK's Official Dreamcast Magazine, issue #x of Dreamcast: Le Magazine Officiel and issue #1 of Dreamcast: Das Offizielle Magazin. Volume 2 was the first Dream On demo disc to be sold exclusively with magazines. Dream On Volume 2 contains two playable demos, four movies and a \"rolling demo\" of Buggy Heat, in which the game isn't playable, but the footage is rendered in real-time. The Millennium Soldier: Expendable demo lets the player play through the first stage, and the Sonic Adventure demo lets players (as Sonic) run through Emerald Coast. The Sonic Adventure demo is particularly common, having been put to work in Generator Vol. 1 and Generator Vol. 2 in North America, kiosks scattered across the world to promote the Dreamcast system, as well as future Dream On demo discs.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133954-dream-on-volume-2\n"}
