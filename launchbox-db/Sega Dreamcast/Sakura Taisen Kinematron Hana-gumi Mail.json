In order for the recipient to see the added features, he/she must also own this disc, otherwise the email will be rendered simply as text (which effectively means the recipient must own a Sakura Taisen Dreamcast). Given the state of the Dreamcast's online capabilities in the modern age, the disc is largely unusable today.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "December 28, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Overworks", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/132231-sakura-taisen-kinematron-hana-gumi-mail\n"}
