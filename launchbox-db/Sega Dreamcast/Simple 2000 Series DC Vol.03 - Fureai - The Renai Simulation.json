The background locations use the processed actual photos, while the characters use typical anime art. Background image is obscured by a frame pattern which makes the location art displayed in widescreen. During the gameplay, the current location, time of day, and the title of a background track currently playing are displayed.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "September 26, 2002", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "HuneX", "publishers": "D3Publisher", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/107871-simple-2000-series-dc-vol03-fureai-the-renai-simulation\n"}
