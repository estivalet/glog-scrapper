Although tiger mum forbids little Sheran to play with edibles, there is simply no way to stop him from playing with fruits found inside the deep jungle. Being shiny, smelling wonderful and tasting even better Sheran can't be kept away. So let's do the best we could do: Support him! The game consists of two boards of fruits. The left field belongs to Sheran who needs to reproduce the right field 1:1 being able to proceed to the next level. Sounds easy?! Fruit'Y Features * Hand set pixels! * Amiga chiptunes! * Score tracking! * 120 levels!", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "October 23, 2015", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "RetroGuru", "publishers": "RetroGuru", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/88546-fruity\n"}
