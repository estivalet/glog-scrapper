{"altername_name": [], "name": "NBA Showtime: NBA on NBC", "overview": "The game features gameplay similar to its predecessors NBA Jam and NBA Hangtime. Rather than typical 5 on 5 action, this game features 2 on 2 play with the ability to pick two players from any NBA team's starting line-up for the first half and can choose again for the second. The game introduces personal fouls for each shove on another player; after a certain number of fouls the opposing team gets a free throw. The game retains the series standard \"on fire\" feature. After a player makes three consecutive shots he becomes \"on fire\", which allows him to easily make shots from almost anywhere, as well as goaltend without penalty and push opponents without being charged a foul. Play otherwise is similar to NBA rules.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "October 1, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Eurocom", "publishers": "Midway", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.12", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Showtime:_NBA_on_NBC", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/18724-nba-showtime-nba-on-nbc\n"}
