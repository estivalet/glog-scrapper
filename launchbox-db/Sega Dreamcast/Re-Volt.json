{"altername_name": [], "name": "Re-Volt", "overview": "For years, the Toy-Volt company has been producing toys and games for children all over the world. Within months of introducing their first products, Toy-Volt shot to the top! No one could put their finger on exactly what it was that made the toys so popular. Sure, they employed the best designers and marketers in the world, but there was something else about Toy-Volt toys, something almost.... magic. Now, their newest R/C cars really start to live! Re-Volt is a racing game where you take control over one of more than 28 R/C cars and drive on one of the 13 tracks. The tracks are varied, and include a toy shop, a supermarket, a luxury liner and more. It is possible to play a \"reversed\" (backwards) or \"mirror\" (reversed left and right) variety of each track.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "December 18, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Probe", "publishers": "Acclaim Entertainment", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.91", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Re-Volt", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/10683-re-volt\n"}
