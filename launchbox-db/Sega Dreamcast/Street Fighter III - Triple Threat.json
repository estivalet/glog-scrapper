{"altername_name": [], "name": "Street Fighter III: Triple Threat", "overview": "Street Fighter III: Triple Threat is a compilation of all three Street Fighter III revisions; New Generation, 2nd Impact: Giant Attack and Third Strike. All games are preserved in their original state. Nothing was ripped or downsampled in this compilation. Third Strike is the retail Dreamcast version; think of Triple Threat as a companion piece to RDC's Third Strike Arcade Edition release. Sort of how Double Impact compiled the two \"irrelevant\" versions of Street Fighter III alongside Third Strike. The changes in Arcade Edition aren't things that a new player would be concerned with.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "February 7, 2012", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/91521-street-fighter-iii-triple-threat\n"}
