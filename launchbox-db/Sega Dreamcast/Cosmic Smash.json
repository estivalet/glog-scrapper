{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cosmic Smash", "overview": "Cosmic Smash, originally released in the arcades, is a futuristic sports game, a mix of squash and Breakout. The player controls a semi-transparent human male in third-person view. The goal is to clear each level from a set of different blocks at the far end of the room within a given time limit. Additional time is given at the start of the next level depending on how well the player did. To clear the room, the player has to hit a ball with a racket at the correct angle. The ball bounces back from the blocks and walls. The blocks have different properties, for example, some have to be hit multiple times before they disappear, while others move around thus making them harder to hit. Besides the regular shot, the player can also perform a trick shot, which in combination with other moves gives extra points when successfully executed. At the end of each level, a map with branching paths is displayed, enabling the player to take different routes towards the end of the game.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "September 13, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega Rosso", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.98", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_Smash", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/14494-cosmic-smash\n"}
