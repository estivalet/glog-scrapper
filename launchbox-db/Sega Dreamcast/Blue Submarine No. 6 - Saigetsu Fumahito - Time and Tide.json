Based on the classic manga Blue Submarine No. 6 and its anime adaptations, this post-apocalyptic naval adventure game has players heading up an undersea salvage crew. In its adventure mode, players interact with other players using menu-driven exploration and dialogue. When they step into the sub, players take to the ocean floor in a first-person 3D simulation where they must salvage parts from crashed ships and other things they can find undersea. The adventure mode features a mix of 2D backgrounds with highly detailed polygonal characters, while key story scenes are told in animated cut-scenes provided by Gonzo, the same studio that animated the 1998-2000 OVA series.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "December 7, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gonzo", "publishers": "Sega Corporation", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.62", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/126487-blue-submarine-no-6-saigetsu-fumahito-time-and-tide\n"}
