{"altername_name": [], "name": "Biohazard Code: Veronica: Trial Edition", "overview": "A demo of CODE: Veronica was included with Biohazard 2 Value Plus on the Dreamcast to sell consumers on the minimally upgraded re-release of the original PlayStation game (actually ported from PC). The demo contained most of the first fifteen minutes of the game, along with all the cut- scenes that made it to the final game in that portion. The only change is that Claire is able to take the Gold Lugers from the display room in the Palace, compared to the final game, in which Steve takes them instead. Claire can take the Lugers to the door in the save room on the second floor, and unlock it by placing the Lugers onto there. In the final game, Claire could only do this after going through the Airport and Military Training Facility. The demo ends with Claire headed towards the Private Residence, and hearing Alexia laughing. The demo also contains a few music tracks from all the Biohazard games up to that point in 1999 (so it excludes Gun Survivor).", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "December 22, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Capcom Production Studio 4", "publishers": "Capcom", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.19", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/t_oAKQyU6fM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/126960-biohazard-code-veronica-trial-edition\n"}
