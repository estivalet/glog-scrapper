Unlike in previous games, this game emphasizes word \"novel\" in its title by having the game play resemble that of a visual novel without built-in clock and time progress as in previous titles. Heroine in this story is Yuka Satou (\u4f50\u85e4 \u7531\u9999) which one day suddenly appears on your doorstep. You returned to your hometown from Tokyo for the summer, and you end up sharing a place with Yuka during the holidays.
