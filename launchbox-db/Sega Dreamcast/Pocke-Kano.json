{"altername_name": ["Pocke-Kano - Yumi - Shizuka - Fumio"], "name": "Pocke-Kano", "overview": "This simulation game was originally released for PlayStation as three separate games, each focusing on a single heroine. The Dreamcast version includes all three heroines: Yumi Aida, Shizuka Houjouin, and Fumio Ueno. While the PSX version supports PocketStation, the Dreamcast version uses visual memory which also uses graphical representation of the character you are interacting with, and emphasizes what is currently happening on the main screen. You can meet the girls, buy them gifts, talk to them, check the progress status, and play various mini-games. The game also includes printed stickers of all three heroines with some additional artwork as well.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "June 8, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Success", "publishers": "Datam Polystar", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/107363-pocke-kano\n"}
