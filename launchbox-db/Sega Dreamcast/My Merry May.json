{"altername_name": [], "name": "My Merry May", "overview": "My Merry May is the first game in a planned (but unfinished) trilogy, originally released for Dreamcast in 2002, followed by a PlayStation 2 port later that year. The story revolves around Kyousuke Watarase, a high-school student, who one day received a strange package. In that package was Reu, an AI android in a form of a young girl who ends up living with him under pretense of being his sister. The game plays as a typical visual novel romance which includes reading on-screen text over background art and character sprites who come in different poses and gestures, but are not animated. Key moments feature special CG artwork to emphasize certain scene and break out from a typical \"character sprite over background art\" presentation. Aside from main characters, all the heroines feature full voice-acting. Player's choices allow the story to branch toward one of the several different endings, some endings focusing on your relationship with a specific heroine.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "April 25, 2002", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kid", "publishers": "KID", "genres": "Visual Novel", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.12", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/119808-my-merry-may\n"}
