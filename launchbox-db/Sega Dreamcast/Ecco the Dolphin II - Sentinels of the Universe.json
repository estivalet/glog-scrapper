Little is known about this game - an early prototype (and source code) dated the 23rd of February 2001 was found on a Dreamcast Dev.Box but shows very little of what the game was meant to entail. Sentinels of the Universe is presumed to have been cancelled due to Sega pulling support for the Dreamcast console, and development does not seem to have been moved to other platforms.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "February 23, 2001", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Appaloosa Interactive", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.17", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecco_the_Dolphin_(series)#Ecco_the_Dolphin:_Sentinels_of_the_Universe", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLToimxrzYI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86058-ecco-the-dolphin-ii-sentinels-of-the-universe\n"}
