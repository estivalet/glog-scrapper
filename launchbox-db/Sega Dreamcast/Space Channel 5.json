{"altername_name": [], "name": "Space Channel 5", "overview": "In 2499 AD, an alien race known as the Morolians shows up and starts forcing people to dance. Ulala from Space Channel 5 gets sent to bring in the news, save the hostages and beat the Morolians, while simultaneously fighting off rival reporters Pudding and Jaguar. In the end, it turns out the Morolians were being brainwashed by Space Channel 5's boss, Blank, who desires ratings over the truth. After failing to defeat Ulala with a robot replica named Evila, he pilots a large version to hurt her, but she is rescued by Jaguar, just like he did when she was young. With the aid of her supporters and Fuse's antenna, Ulala uses groove energy to defeat Blank and send him to the other side of the universe.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "June 4, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "United Game Artists", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Music", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.76", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Channel_5", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0A5smrzVaA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/413-space-channel-5\n"}
