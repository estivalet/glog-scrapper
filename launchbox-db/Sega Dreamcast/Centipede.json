Players blast away at the classic centipedes, spiders, fleas, and scorpions while fighting new enemies like the mosquito, cockroach, and killer mushroom. A \"classic\" mode is also included, which allows players to play the classic game in a new \"3D\" isometric perspective.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "October 31, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Leaping Lizard Software", "publishers": "Hasbro Interactive", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.34", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centipede_(1998_video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/7802-centipede\n"}
