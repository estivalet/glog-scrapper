{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Typing of the Dead", "overview": "This is essentially the same game as the arcade light-gun rail-shooter House of the Dead 2, except they've turned it into a edu-tainment typing trainer. Instead of guns, your characters have keyboards strapped to them, and instead of shooting the zombies that constantly jump out at you you'll need to type out the words attached to the zombies in order to kill them before they crack open your head and feast upon the goo inside. The game ranks you on your typing speed and provides various tutorials and other edu-tainment sundries. Otherwise it's pretty much the same game as House of the Dead 2. Much like the Resident Evil series, the zombie hordes have gone from infesting a vaguely gothic creepy old mansion to infesting a vaguely gothic decaying city, and its your job to stop them and save the human race (as usual).", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "January 25, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "M - Mature", "developers": "Smilebit", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.16", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Typing_of_the_Dead", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/10659-the-typing-of-the-dead\n"}
