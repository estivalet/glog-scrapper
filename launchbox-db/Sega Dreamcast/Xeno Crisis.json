{"altername_name": [], "name": "Xeno Crisis", "overview": "Xeno Crisis is inspired by similar arcade shooters like Smash TV and Shock Troopers, with art direction inspired by the Alien movie franchise. Featuring single or cooperative gameplay, one or two players play as unnamed space marines and work their way through seven levels in a scientific facility featuring procedurally generated rooms and levels, with a number of enemies of various difficulty in each room, concluding with a final boss battle at the end of most levels. After a player kills enemies on screen, a chance of an item, a weapon drop, health, or dogtags are dropped to aid the player. Dogtags are used as an in-game currency to help purchase upgrades like additional health or player speed. To increase the challenge to players, the starting machine gun has a limited amount of ammunition, and weapon pickups have a limited number of uses, requiring players to stay on the move and on the lookout for ammunition boxes.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "June 16, 2020", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bitmap Bureau", "publishers": "Bitmap Bureau", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.17", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xeno_Crisis", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/149735-xeno-crisis\n"}
