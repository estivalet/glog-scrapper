{"altername_name": [], "name": "Miss Moonlight", "overview": "You wake up at the strange loud sound coming from the bathroom. You get up from the bed and go to check what it was. Duh, it was Sandia and her strange animal companion wreaking havoc. Quick flashback to a couple of days ago, as you were waiting for your father at the airport to return from a negotiation mission from a country devastated by the civil war, to your surprise, he brought someone with him. That someone was Sandia, a princess of the country he just returned from, in danger for her life. It just so happens she'll be staying with your from now on, indefinitely as it seems. You are Kouki Akiba, a high-school student with a regular boring school life with nothing to cause your sudden elevation in blood pressure. But that's about to change when princess Sandia who recently started living with you enters the same school you are attending. But where there are problems, there are obstacles to overcome, which may over short period of time lead to something more than just friendship between Kouki and Sandia. The game itself is similar to the majority of visual novels in terms of basic gameplay, but differs in the artwork style which sets it apart from most of them. Bonus features include unlockable BGM player and CG gallery for each of the heroines.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "June 21, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Spiel", "publishers": "Naxat Soft", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/107853-miss-moonlight\n"}
