{"altername_name": [], "name": "Super Puzzle Fighter II X for Matching Service", "overview": "Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo, known as Super Puzzle Fighter II X (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30d1\u30ba\u30eb\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u2161\uff38) in Japan, is a puzzle game similar to the likes of Tetris or Puyo Puyo, developed and published by Capcom. It was brought to the Sega Saturn in 1996. Despite its name there was never a \"Super Puzzle Fighter 1\" - it is merely just a play on Capcom's earlier game, Super Street Fighter II Turbo. This being said, the game is actually influenced by Street Fighter Alpha and the Darkstalkers franchise, with most Street Fighter II characters missing. Though characters from both series appear in the game they are not controllable by the player, acting solely as avatars. Similar to other \"falling piece\" puzzle games, the aim of Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo is to eliminate your opponent by filling their playfield with blocks (or gems, in this case). In order to achieve this, you must eliminate coloured gems on your side of the play area and produce combos when doing so. As well as a Saturn port, the game was brought to the Sega Dreamcast in 2001 for Capcom's Matching Service. This version was not released outside of Japan.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "July 5, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Capcom", "publishers": "Capcom", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.45", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/91517-super-puzzle-fighter-ii-x-for-matching-service\n"}
