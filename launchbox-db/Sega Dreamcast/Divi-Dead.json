My uncle is the dean of this school. About a month ago, he paid me a visit and offered me enrollment at his school. Seeing I've been out of school for a long time, I accepted his offer. What was the catch? He asked me to keep an eye out for him. Bluntly, I was to be his spy? No problem. Well actually, there was a problem. Once I arrived, I started noticing some disturbing things. There was violence and misconduct happening on campus, not the usual pass times at a private high school. As I got deeper into my investigation, I came across a possible correlation between an underground society and the unusual behavior of my peers. I realized that I could not trust ANYONE. There's just one last thing...After transferring, sometime between all the sexual escapades happening on campus, and my investigation, something horrifying happened to me. I...? Join me in my quest to uncover the horrible secrets at Asao Private School...and find out what fate holds for me.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "October 22, 2008", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "", "developers": "C's Ware", "publishers": "Tales Translations", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.86", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divi-Dead", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4kyI75rf34", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/91529-divi-dead\n"}
