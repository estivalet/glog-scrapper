{"altername_name": [], "name": "Heavy Metal: Geomatrix", "overview": "Based on the Heavy Metal world created by Kevin Eastman and Simon Bisley, this fighting title allows you to take control of a team of three fighters, ranging from a basic all-rounder, or a lightning fast female to a huge bulky mass of power. Of course, they are all a mix of human and humanoid, and depending on their strengths, have a range of different moves and styles. The main aim of the game is to defeat each of the opposing 3-man teams ahead of you, and dominate cyberspace. The game mixes a little of Street Fighter with a dash of Virtual On, allowing you to fight in close or use long range attacks all inside a 3D landscape.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "September 13, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "M - Mature", "developers": "Capcom", "publishers": "Capcom", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.68", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_Metal%3A_Geomatrix?wprov=sfla1", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/qSjlG9g3wX0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/7826-heavy-metal-geomatrix\n"}
