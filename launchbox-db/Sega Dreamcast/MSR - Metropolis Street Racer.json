{"altername_name": ["Metropolis Street Racer"], "name": "MSR: Metropolis Street Racer", "overview": "Gameplay in MSR is centred around the single-player mode, with tracks and cars in the multiplayer mode being unlocked at the same time as in the single-player game. The premise is that, as a street racer, the player must impress other drivers with quick but stylish driving in a series of challenges. These challenges are in sets of ten (called Chapters - there are 25 in total), with completion of all challenges opening the next chapter (assuming the player has enough Kudos, see below) and unlocking a new car. Each challenge is on a different track, and unlocking a challenge unlocks that track in the time-attack and multiplayer modes.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "November 3, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Bizarre Creations", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.16", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis_Street_Racer", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7XuNL88YQ8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/10194-msr-metropolis-street-racer\n"}
