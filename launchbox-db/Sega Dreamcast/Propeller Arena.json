{"altername_name": ["Propeller Arena: Aviation Battle Championship"], "name": "Propeller Arena", "overview": "Propeller Arena: Aviation Battle Championship is a video game for the Dreamcast console. It was originally titled Propeller Head Online and was on display at E3 on May 19, 2001, with an expected release date of 9/19/2001. It was developed, completed and trademarked by Sega AM2 in August, but the game never officially released and was cancelled just days after the September 11 attacks, citing both similarities in game packaging and design to the events of that day, as well as the Dreamcast's declining market share, resulting in projected low sales numbers. Hopes of a port to another console never materialized. However, a disk image of the game was eventually leaked, and became a popular download on many peer-to-peer networks.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega AM2", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propeller_Arena", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/18728-propeller-arena\n"}
