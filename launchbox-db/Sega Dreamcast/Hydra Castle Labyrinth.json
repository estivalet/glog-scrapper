{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hydra Castle Labyrinth", "overview": "Hydra Castle Labyrinth, originally Meikyuujou Hydra, is a freeware Indie platformer developed by E. Hashimoto, a.k.a. Buster, and released on his website. The original game was entirely in Japanese, but saw a translation patch months after its original creation. The game hearkens back to early \"Metroidvania\" games like Knightmare II: The Maze of Galious and Legacy of the Wizard: the player explores an immense maze-like dungeon, collecting tools and keys that allow them to proceed deeper. Certain areas are cordoned off from the main dungeon area, and each presents a more linear zone with a boss at the end. The player can find new equipment to make themselves stronger as well.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "March 1, 2020", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "", "developers": "E.Hashimoto", "publishers": "QueenMeka", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULyyi151ZRM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/155113-hydra-castle-labyrinth\n"}
