{"altername_name": ["Capcom vs. SNK 2 Taisen Fan Disc"], "name": "Capcom Taisen Fan Disc", "overview": "Titled \"Capcom Taisen Fan Disk\", the disk will include complete VMU data of 19 capcom fighter game titles, an Illustration gallery of the Capcom vs SNK series, and a high-level replay data collection for Capcom Vs SNK 2. Not on sale by itself, but came with the original release of Capcom vs SNK 2 for people who preordered it, making it a bit of a curiosity for DC devotees. The disk has data on all the pugilists from the Capcom vs SNK series. The VMU is used to be able to upload data to the game itself (if owned) and view Capcom producers super bouts. There are also plenty of Capcom VMU game save screens for a bit of fun.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "2000", "game_type": "DLC", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Capcom", "publishers": "Capcom", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.12", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/91510-capcom-taisen-fan-disc\n"}
