{"altername_name": [], "name": "Maqiupai", "overview": "Maqiupai - Get into Ancient China's crazy mah-jong (in English) Maqiupai is the classic game of Mahjong with a modern twist. You need to remove all of the tiles in each challenging puzzle before time runs out. You can only remove tiles that match and are free on one side to be removed. You'll have to use lots of strategy to make your way through this variant of Mahjong that has also gone by the name of Shanghai. What sets Maqiupai apart from the other versions of Shanghai that have been released is how the game is played - there are two modes to Maqiupai: Challenge and Time Attack. In challenge, you will set to the task of removing tiles as quickly as possible. You work as the clock works against you, counting down to your fate. Luckily, you have the use of Shinobi Jokers on your side - tiles that will clear the board of any other tiles like them. After you have unlocked a table in Challenge mode, you will be able to play it in Time Attack and compete with others from around the world by submitting your highest scores online!", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "January 19, 2005", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "", "developers": "JMD", "publishers": "GOAT Store, LLC", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/88756-maqiupai\n"}
