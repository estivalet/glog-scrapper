The player can drive around San Francisco, crashing into objects. There are two scenarios: Scenario A places the player in control of San Francisco Motors, a kind of \"messenger/delivery/bomb disposal service\" rolled up in one, while Scenario B has the player controlling laid-back San Francisco police officers. The two scenarios have different missions, whether it's stopping a runaway cable car, or collecting bombs for disposal.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "October 28, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Climax Entertainment", "publishers": "Climax Entertainment", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.59", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Runabout:_San_Francisco_Edition", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/29327-super-runabout-san-francisco-edition\n"}
