{"altername_name": [], "name": "Zero Gunner 2", "overview": "In the near future, scientists working for the powerful Asian conglomerate known as Igem have discovered a new energy source. Refusing to share their technique with the rest of the world, Igem eventually developed a weather control machine named ONI, which they intend to use for the purpose of global domination. A squadron of ace helicopter pilots, called Zero Gunner, is assembled to destroy ONI - but Igem fights back with everything they've got... Zero Gunner 2 is a top-down shooter. All backdrops and vehicles in this game are modelled in 3D, though the gameplay mostly follows the conventions of 2D shooters. Since your craft is a helicopter, a \"target and spin\" feature has been added, whereby you can both rotate your craft to attack an enemy more efficiently, or alternatively lock on a particular point in space and rotate around it while still firing. These actions are not automatically executed, and are controlled by the player; in order to succeed, mastering this feature is imperative. The usual power-ups and boss enemy battles are included in the game, along with a selection of helicopters to choose from.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "May 15, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Psikyo", "publishers": "Psikyo", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.21", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_Gunner_2?wprov=sfla1", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/9587-zero-gunner-2\n"}
