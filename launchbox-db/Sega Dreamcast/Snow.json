{"altername_name": [], "name": "Snow", "overview": "The story of Snow starts when the main protagonist Kanata Izumo revisits a small village from his childhood called Ry\u016bjin-mura (\u9f8d\u795e\u6751, lit. \"Dragon God Village\"). He is revisiting Ry\u016bjin-mura to help manage a local inn with hot springs, Ry\u016bjin Tenshukaku (\u9f8d\u795e\u5929\u5b88\u95a3, lit. \"Dragon God Keep\"), alongside his cousin Tsugumi. In the village, there is an old legend: In ancient times, Ry\u016bjin-mura was protected by the dragon goddess. However, one day the goddess fell in love with a human, which is strictly forbidden, and this incident caused the village to be always covered by snow after that. The game then tells the daily life of Kanata interacting with the village girls and ultimately links the story to the legend. Snow follows a branching plot line with multiple endings, and depending on the decisions that the player makes during the game, the plot will progress in a specific direction.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "September 25, 2003", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Studio Mebius", "publishers": "NEC Interchannel", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_(visual_novel)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/131190-snow\n"}
