The player give an artillery piece a shot angle and shot power, and try to hit the opponent, taking into account wind effects. The player and the opponent exchange these shots in a turn-based fashion. The game puts the player in command of a team of up to eight worms, which can move around the landscape (one at a time), using many types of weapons to try to dispatch the enemy, from bazookas to mini-guns to exploding sheep. In some situations, the worms can also jump, swing by rope, and descend with a parachute.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "November 30, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Team17 Software", "publishers": "MicroProse", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.68", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worms_Armageddon", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnNc2KD_PXc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/8025-worms-armageddon\n"}
