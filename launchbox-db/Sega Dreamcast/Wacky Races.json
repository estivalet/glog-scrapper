Choose from all your favourite characters including Peter Perfect, Penelope Pitstop and, of course, Dick Dastardly and Muttley, and wind your way through cartoon like environments in the familiar vehicles of each character. Simply get to the end of the race first to open up new tracks, and use weapons to pick off the rest of the cast, and aid your progress.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "June 9, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Infogrames", "publishers": "Infogrames", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.10", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wacky_Races_(2000_video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/8024-wacky-races\n"}
