Many gameplay features remain as before. Single Player Modes: Session - Take some extra time to practice your tricks and routines in 2, 5, or 10 minute sessions on any of the levels that are unlocked. Scores can be saved to be put into the Hall of Fame. Free Ride - Like Session, you can use this time to practice your skills but with unlimited time. Any score you get for a trick is replaced by the points of the next trick. Since this is the case, no scores can be saved. Road Trip - This is where you take the trip with the guys to go around and compete around the country. Withine each level there are goals to reach to improve your skills, unlock new levels, unlock bikes, and secrets in the game.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "September 12, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Runecraft", "publishers": "Activision", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.66", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mat_Hoffman%27s_Pro_BMX", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/22576-mat-hoffmans-pro-bmx\n"}
