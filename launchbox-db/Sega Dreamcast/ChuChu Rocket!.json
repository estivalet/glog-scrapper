{"altername_name": [], "name": "ChuChu Rocket!", "overview": "ChuChu Rocket is an action puzzler, designed predominantly as a multi-player game. You have indirect control over mice, and must guide them to the safety of a rocket, and away from a cat. You do this by placing arrows on the ground, which they will follow. The multi-player game is a frantic all-against-all duel, in which each player's mice will only follow instructions of their own colour. You can play this mode on your own against CPU opponents, or take on a series of predefined puzzles", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "November 11, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Sonic Team", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.89", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChuChu_Rocket!", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHBsA-PZXiA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/3468-chuchu-rocket\n"}
