{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ikaruga", "overview": "Vertical shoot-em-up ported from the Naomi Arcade version. Ikaruga is more or less a sequel to Radiant Silvergun on the Sega Saturn. Based on a two-colors system, the player has to switch between the black & white sides of his ship during gameplay. The black side is immune to black enemy bullets which it considers as a bonus and dies on impact with white enemy bullets. Your own black bullets damage white enemies twice as much as white bullets. And vice-versa for the white side. Those properties make a balance between protecting yourself well and killing enemies fast. This aspect, combined with specific enemy patterns and a combo system makes Ikaruga an original shoot-em-up with a dose of strategy.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "September 5, 2002", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Treasure", "publishers": "Entertainment Software Publishing", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.45", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikaruga", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GYzLxul3Y0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/190-ikaruga\n"}
