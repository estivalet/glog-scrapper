It was released exclusively in Japan and was only available between 16 and 24 December 1999. Like the original Seaman it gives you the chance to raise your own pet, starting with nothing but a tiny egg? How about raise him to be a smart-mouthed, viper-tongued companion who listens to you and gives you a dose of smart-ass advice? Look no further than the lab of Dr. Jean Paul Gass\u00e9, who left you a few eggs from the mysterious creature known as the Seaman. Now you've got the chance to raise your very own Seaman. Talk to him, tickle him, feed him...just don't rub him the wrong way, or you'll end up with an angry pet and a big headache.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "December 16, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "VIVARIUM", "publishers": "DigiToys", "genres": "Life Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/126493-christmas-seaman-omoi-o-tsutaeru-mou-hitotsu-no-houhou\n"}
