{"altername_name": ["The Flintstones: Viva Rock Vegas"], "name": "The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas", "overview": "The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas is an unreleased Dreamcast racing game, developed by Full Fat and set to be published by Swing! Entertainment. It is based on the 2000 film of the same name, itself based on Hanna-Barbera's The Flintstones franchise. This Dreamcast adaptation was a kart racer, similar to others at the time, featuring various characters and environments from the movie. A notable thing is that, while based on a live-action movie, the game's look is more in line with that of the original Flintstones cartoons, as well as powerups being obtained through knocking bowling pins, also a nod towards the show. While this Dreamcast version was cancelled, a sample version, likely intended for the press, has since surfaced. Had it been released, it likely would've come out in late 2000, or early 2001. While it is not known if the game was meant to see release outside of Europe, the presence of Conspiracy Entertainment in the opening logos means it's likely that they would've been the North American publishers. A Viva Rock Vegas game was eventually released by Swing! in mid-2001 for the PlayStation 2 exclusively in Europe, but while it also is a kart racer, it is a completely different game from this Dreamcast adaptation. It was developed by Toka and features a graphical style more in line with the movie, as well as different gameplay and other elements. Interestingly said version was planned to have a Japanese release by Idea Factory, but while that didn't happen, the game itself still mentions the company, oddly. Another Viva Rock Vegas game, also by Swing!, was planned for the GameCube, in development by Zombie Studios, but this was also cancelled.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Full Fat Productions", "publishers": "Swing!
