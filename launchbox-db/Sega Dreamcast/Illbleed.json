{"altername_name": [], "name": "Illbleed", "overview": "llbleed is a survival horror video game for the Sega Dreamcast. In it, players are tasked with guiding horror movie aficionado Eriko Christy through a deadly theme park riddled with booby-traps and monsters, relying on a heartbeat monitor and her own senses (some of which are conveyed through an in-game interface and others indirectly) to avoid being frightened to death. Should she make it out alive, the eccentric genius responsible for the park's creation, Michael Reynolds, will reward Eriko with a hundred million dollar prize and allow her to leave the amusement park.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "April 25, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "M - Mature", "developers": "Crazy Games", "publishers": "AIA", "genres": "Horror", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.69", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illbleed", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuyfZudAFxM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/13897-illbleed\n"}
