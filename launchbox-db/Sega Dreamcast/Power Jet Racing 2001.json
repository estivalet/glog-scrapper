{"altername_name": [], "name": "Power Jet Racing 2001", "overview": "Though there have been countless games based on Jet Ski racing since Wave Race 64 originally kick-started the genre several years ago, no game has lived up to the original. CSK Research Institute, the developer of the Aero Dancing series, hopes to change that with Power Jet Racing 2001, a water-based racing game for the Dreamcast. You'll be able to select one of six racers, each with his or her favorite Jet Ski. Ryan, Kate, Max, Yuki, Spike, and Matt all have different attributes and qualities that define their riding styles. The game features several modes. The championship mode plays similar to the arcade-game format, where you have to finish each race with a high rank to get to the next one. The technical challenge mode tests your skills and abilities by requiring you to execute several different moves such as loops, barrel rolls, bunny hops, and submarines. Other modes include the balloon race, time attack, and two-player versus modes.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "March 22, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "CRI", "publishers": "CRI", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/91511-power-jet-racing-2001\n"}
