You play as Ryouichi Katsuragi, a young doctor and a family physician summoned to tend to an old man living in a huge mansion on the island in Italy. Upon arriving to the island in a helicopter, the game switches to 3rd-person perspective where you can freely explore the mansion and its surroundings and interact with various characters, including the mansion maids which act as heroines in this story. During 1st-person perspective mode, the game plays like a typical visual novel where you converse with other characters which are non-animated but feature voice-acting. The player choices during dialogues affect the story and key choices branch it toward a different ending. The bonus features which are accessible from the main menu are music player and unlockable heroine gallery.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "July 25, 2002", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Key", "publishers": "NEC Interchannel", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/107277-elysion-eien-no-sanctuary\n"}
