{"altername_name": [], "name": "L.O.L.: Lack of Love", "overview": "Lack of Love (or L.O.L.) can be considered a genre-defying game, though it has strong elements of adventure (problem-solving based on exploration) and RPG (character growth and management). The game's unusual premise is the evolution of an alien being. In the beginning the player takes control of a tiny, newborn creature. The alien world is harsh, so the \"hero\" has to constantly improve, learn new things and avoid being eaten by other animals. To make the new life even harder, an alien robot race just discovered the planet and starts colonizing it. Surviving is obviously not easy... The game is played from a third-person perspective with pre-rendered backgrounds. Since the protagonist is an animal, the game doesn't have any ingame texts; for solving riddles the player is totally dependent on experimentation and careful observation of the environment. To reach the next state of evolution the player will also need to help other beings - as a reward they will give the controlled creature energy balls or new abilities required for further progress. Besides the usual actions like attacking, biting, and talking (or, better to say, communicating) the creature can perform somewhat strange actions such as sleeping and urinating, which are essential to the gameplay.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "November 2, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Love-de-Lic", "publishers": "ASCII", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.54", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/30115-lol-lack-of-love\n"}
