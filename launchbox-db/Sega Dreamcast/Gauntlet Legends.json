{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gauntlet Legends", "overview": "The diabolical Skorne has scattered the planet's powerful rune stones throughout the world so that nobody can use their powers to challenge his evil rule. Pick your character either the Warrior, Wizard, Valkyrie, or Archer and work with your party as you go on the ultimate manhunt. Fight your way through castles, deserts, temples, and forests and upgrade your weapons and powers as you collect money and experience. The action is fast and furious, but if you don't fight smart you'll find yourself right back where you started. But it'll take more than a powerful punch to get far, as there are a host of puzzles that will challenge your mind and might mean the difference between success and failure. Can you find the rune stones and use them to your advantage? It may be the only way to defeat Skorne, so gather your party and head into the great unknown on the most important journey of your life.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "June 6, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Atari Games", "publishers": "Midway Games", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.02", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauntlet_Legends", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjT8c19InKI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/3482-gauntlet-legends\n"}
