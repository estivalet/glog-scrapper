{"altername_name": [], "name": "Izumo", "overview": "Hikaru is a normal Japanese teenager, who goes to the prestigious Izumo academy. Lately he has been seeing dreams: a mysterious woman appears, trying to tell him something. One day he accidentally touches a mirror in an abandoned building near the school. At this moment, the school becomes infested with monsters. Hikaru and his sister have no choice but to fight the monsters and to find out the connection to the hero's mysterious dreams. Izumo is a standard Japanese RPG with extensive portions of \"digital novel\", in which the player views events displayed as anime-style still shots, occasionally making a decision. The main part of the gameplay - RPG - consists of navigating the party of heroes through the dungeon and fighting random enemies in turn-based combat viewed from isometric perspective. The camera can be rotated 180 degrees during exploration. The characters have elemental affinities and can learn various types of elemental magic.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "January 29, 2004", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Studio Ego", "publishers": "Symbio Planning", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/107838-izumo\n"}
