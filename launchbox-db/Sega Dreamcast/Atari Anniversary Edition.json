{"altername_name": [], "name": "Atari Anniversary Edition", "overview": "The Dreamcast/Windows version features the following games: \u2022 Asteroids \u2022 Asteroids Deluxe \u2022 Battlezone \u2022 Centipede \u2022 Crystal Castles \u2022 Gravitar \u2022 Millipede \u2022 Missile Command \u2022 Pong \u2022 Super Breakout \u2022 Tempest \u2022 Warlords In addition to the pure emulation modes, there is an option to display the cabinet art surrounding the display of each game, intended to give the player a sense of actually playing a stand-up machine. Each game also has a toggle for an \"enhanced\" graphical mode, which varies from game to game. For instance, \"enhanced\" asteroids merely has a static backdrop, whereas \"enhanced\" warlords is a complete graphical overhaul with new colors. It should be noted that the \"enhanced\" version of Tempest is none other than Tempest Tubes, a modification of Tempest made in 1982 by Duncan Brown. Also included is a gallery of game memorabilia, video clips of an interview with Nolan Bushnell, and desktop themes for Windows.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "June 30, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Digital Eclipse Software", "publishers": "Infogrames", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.81", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/7797-atari-anniversary-edition\n"}
