It takes its gameplay style from the SD Gundam series and adds political and military management to the One Year War. The title is derived from that of Nobunaga's Ambition, although the English title uses a different translation for the word yabou. Giren no Yabou: Zeon no Keifu introduces a more complex political system. The player can now create ceasefires and treaties, and the military system supports mobile suit upgrading and customization. The map system is also updated. Zeon no Keifu expands beyond the One Year War setting and into Zeta-era conflicts, introducing new factions to: AEUG, two factions of the Titans (one under Jamitov and one under Scirocco), Axis Zeon, Neo Zeon, Delaz Fleet. It also includes two versions of the Zeon forces: Kycillia's \"Legitimate Zeon\" and Garma's \"Zeon Reborn\".", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "June 29, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bandai", "publishers": "Bandai", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/32894-mobile-suit-gundam-gihrens-ambition-blood-of-zeon\n"}
