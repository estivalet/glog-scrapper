The game is also an installment in the Darkstalkers franchise, presenting a collection of all eighteen characters and four different play modes available in the series. Like in the previous games, the playable characters are monsters and supernatural creatures, such as vampires, werewolves, demons, zombies and mummies, instead of regular boxers or kung-fu and karate fighters.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "August 10, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Capcom", "publishers": "Capcom", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.38", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/51263-vampire-chronicle-for-matching-service\n"}
