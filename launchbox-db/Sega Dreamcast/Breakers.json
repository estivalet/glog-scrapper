{"altername_name": [], "name": "Breakers", "overview": "Breakers is a good, polished yet generic, mid-tier 90\u2019s \u2018beat-em-up\u2019 and represents something of a leap over the contemporary 16-bit fighters of the time. Huge sprites, great animated backgrounds (which feature characters who actually react to the fights going on in front of them), consistent frame rate, great music, and effects makes Breakers a real treat for the senses. Breakers arrives on Dreamcast with a full feature set. Game modes, options, and roster are all intact. Visually the Dreamcast port of Breakers is also good. Summary - It looks as though your appreciation for Breakers on the Dreamcast will live and die by your tastes for the fighting genre, and your affinity with previous incarnations of the game (or indeed, the sequel, Breakers Revenge). If you're totally new to the series and have no/little prior with SNK hardware, there's no reason at all that you'd get anything but thorough enjoyment out of Breakers. It's a fun and challenging fighter, which while hardly original does everything you'd expect it to do. Relive the classic fighter experience!!", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "June 9, 2017", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Visco", "publishers": "JoshProd", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.3", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakers_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/105135-breakers\n"}
