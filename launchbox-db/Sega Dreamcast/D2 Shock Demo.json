{"altername_name": ["D2 Shock"], "name": "D2 Shock Demo", "overview": "This is a demo version of Warp's Dreamcast game D2. In Japan, a demonstration version of D2 was packaged with another Warp-produced game, the Dreamcast remake of the Sega Saturn title Real Sound: Kaze no Regret. This early preview of the game, known as D2 Shock Demo, features modified opening credits and a \"heads up display\" compared to the completed game. Additionally, it contains a save file that copies to the Dreamcast VMU and unlocks a \"secret movie\" in the retail Japanese version of D2. This movie is a preview of the shelved M2 version of D2. It was removed from the North American version but can briefly be seen as an in-flight movie during the hijacking sequence.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Warp", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.12", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D2_(video_game)#Development", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2A4jQ6SGa3A", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/124263-d2-shock-demo\n"}
