{"altername_name": [], "name": "Agartha", "overview": "Agartha is a Survival Horror game by French developer No Cliche, originally set to release in 1999 for the SEGA Dreamcast. However, the game was pushed back until its cancellation, coinciding with the console's own demise. Nearly two decades later, a playable E3 demo of Agartha found its way onto the internet, leaked on January 15, 2018. During the winter of 1929, in a Romanian village that was partially destroyed in a mysterious earthquake, a subterranean city exists called Agartha. This is where evil is being kept prisoner and is desperate to escape. Kirk, the human hero, will face monsters, demons, and other spawn of Agartha. Save as many innocent people as possible or trigger the arrival of chaos on earth. As Kirk's morals waver between good and evil, this ambiguity changes the aims of the adventure and the narration of the story.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "2001", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "", "developers": "No Cliche", "publishers": "No Cliche", "genres": "Horror", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.41", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/sk4GJMh3Gwo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109887-agartha\n"}
