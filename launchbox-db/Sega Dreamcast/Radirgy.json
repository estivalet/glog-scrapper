{"altername_name": [], "name": "Radirgy", "overview": "Radirgy is a vertical-screen top-down bullet-hell shooter originally developed by Milestone for Naomi arcade system and later released on console systems. The game features bright, cartoony, cel-shaded graphics. At the beginning, the player is given choice among three different mecha-ships: one with a spread-gun, a weak homing laser, or a slow but powerful bubble gun. Additionally, each ship can use a sword for anything that gets too close, or specific enemies which can't be killed otherwise, a shield, which appears at the front of the ship once the player lets go of the fire button, and a smart-bomb-like field that can be extended around the player in a small circle, damaging enemies, absorbing their shots and turning them into points.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "February 16, 2006", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "Milestone", "publishers": "Able", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.04", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radirgy?wprov=sfla1", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/18729-radirgy\n"}
