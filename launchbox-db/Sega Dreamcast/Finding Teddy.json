{"altername_name": [], "name": "Finding Teddy", "overview": "Finding Teddy is a 2D point-and-click/tap adventure game with 8-bit retro style graphics. It is about a little girl whose teddy bear is stolen while she is sleeping by a monster that appears from her wardrobe. She chases after it when she wakes up and ends up in a strange world. The game consists of three parts along with a prologue and an epilogue. The girl cannot move freely. Instead she moves from screen to screen, left or right, when there is a passage. Items in the environment can be picked up and it is possible to interact with the environment by clicking/tapping where allowed. When you click or tap the girl, her inventory appears around her as a circle of bubbles. Items from the inventory can be used in the environment by selecting them in the inventory first and then in the scenery. They do not need to be combined in the inventory. Along the way she will pick up two companions, a fly and a cat, who can also be used to solve puzzles. Many puzzles are also about deciphering the sound based alphabet used in the world. Sounds can be decoded into letters and appear in a separate section near the top of the screen. It is possible to die in the game, but the girl immediately respawns at the same location.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "May 15, 2019", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Storybird SARL", "publishers": "JoshProd", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.83", "wikipedia": "https://www.mobygames.com/game/dreamcast/finding-teddy", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIPkQ3SywZ8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/154693-finding-teddy\n"}
