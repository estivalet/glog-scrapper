The roster of wrestlers has been greatly increased, now including more of the All Japan roster and even some legendary pro wrestling figures from Japan and the US like Rikidozan, Bruno Sammartino, and Bruiser Brody. The control has been tightened, it's not as easy to block every strike your opponent throws now, likewise you have to be a bit more precise with your commands when attempting moves. There's a greater number of double team moves, and the Burning system has been overhauled.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "August 10, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Scarab", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzluvC8pNIA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/14499-giant-gram-2000-all-japan-pro-wrestling-3\n"}
