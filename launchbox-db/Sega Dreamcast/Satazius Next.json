{"altername_name": [], "name": "Satazius Next", "overview": "2051, location: SATAZIUS, a long-abandoned planet. The cruiser Agano was on patrol when it was attacked and stricken by a confederacy of space pirates that had established a base on SATAZIUS. They attacked the Agano intending to steal the assault ship \u2018Trafalgar\u2019 that was stowed aboard the Agano, but the Trafalgar made a successful emergency escape. The crew of the Trafalgar calculated the probability of successfully escaping the pirate overrun planet at 0.02%; the probability of charging into and successfully destroying the pirate base was 1%. Taking the higher probability escape plan, the crew of the Trafalgar turned their ship and charged the pirates.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "2020", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "ASTRO PORT", "publishers": "JoshProd", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165916-satazius-next\n"}
