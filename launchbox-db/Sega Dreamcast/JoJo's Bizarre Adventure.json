{"altername_name": ["Jojo no Kimyou na Bouken: Mirai e no Isan"], "name": "JoJo's Bizarre Adventure", "overview": "Jotaru Kujo, the star of the JOJO'S VENTURE comic book series, has a problem. His mother is sick, afflicted with a strange illness related to a spirit called a Stand. The cause of all this trouble is the evil Dio, whom JoJo sets out to defeat in order to save his mother. As JoJo travels towards Egypt and a showdown with Dio, he must challenge Dio's minions whose sole purpose is to keep JoJo from succeeding. Playing as one of 16 characters, you'll kick, punch, and pummel your way closer to Dio with each victory. A unique addition to this 2D fighter is the Stand, a guardian spirit that can aid the player during a fight. Unlike mortal beings, Stands can reanimate quickly after being defeated, which is something the player can use to his advantage in battle. Help JoJo save his mom and defeat the diabolical Dio in the saga of JOJO'S BIZARRE ADVENTURE.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "October 31, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Capcom", "publishers": "Capcom", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.33", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JoJo%27s_Bizarre_Adventure_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5euWJkcDMrQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/3487-jojos-bizarre-adventure\n"}
