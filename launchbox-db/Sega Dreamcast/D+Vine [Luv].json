{"altername_name": ["Divine Love"], "name": "D+Vine [Luv]", "overview": "D+Vine[Luv] (pronounced Divine Love) is a typical J-RPG, using a top-down perspective with a slightly isometric representation, which also utilizes visual novel segments for adventure elements. The player takes control of Hyde, an adventurous lad who has a knack for exploring dungeons in search of relics from the old world. One day, he arrives at the town called Arvil where he hears a rumor about a nearby unexplored cave. He heads there determined to find new relics, not minding the fact that noone's been there in ages and the place is probably infested with monsters. To his surprise, he doesn't discover and relic or a treasure, but instead, a mysterious girl named Yura. She has apparently lost her memory and can't remember anything but her name. Unlike the original PC (Windows) version released almost two years earlier, the Dreamcast port does not feature any adult content. A couple of years later, DVD PG Edition release came out which also includes adult content.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "October 25, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Abogado Powers", "publishers": "Princess Soft", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/107811-dvine-luv\n"}
