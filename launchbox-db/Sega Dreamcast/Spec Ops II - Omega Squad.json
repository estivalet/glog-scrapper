{"altername_name": [], "name": "Spec Ops II: Omega Squad", "overview": "Spec Ops II: Omega Squad is a first person shooter game for the Sega Dreamcast released in 2000 by Ripcord Games and developed by Runecraft, and is a conversion of the 1999 PC game Spec Ops II: Green Berets, originally developed by Zombie Studios. Players control a squad of special operations soldiers who must carry out a string of tactical missions across the planet. Unlike previous Spec Ops games, a single soldier is controlled instead of a complete squad. The mission objectives include destroying enemy compounds, recovering military hardware and rescuing hostages. They take place in five different locales: Antarctica, Korea, Pakistan, Thailand, and Germany. Each country has a specific mission that entails promoting the well being of the United States of America - there is no specific storyline but rather a collection of missions to complete. Most of them are based on possible future events in the 21st century, not based on existing, historical conflicts.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "October 24, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Runecraft", "publishers": "Ripcord Games", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.44", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/10673-spec-ops-ii-omega-squad\n"}
