{"altername_name": [], "name": "Urban Chaos", "overview": "As the 2nd millennium ends, the cities are over-ran with Apocalyptic violence. Is this down to urban frustrations, or a sinister cult controlling everybody? You are either cop D'Arcy Stern or former soldier Roper McIntyre, and have to find the answers, but more importantly put a stop to the carnage. This involves a succession of action-packed non-linear missions. The environment incorporates shadows, rain, fog and a day/night cycle. Police cars, motorcycles and ambulances must be controlled during some missions. There are many ways to 'settle' the enemies - car chases, hand-to-hand combats and action movie-style shoot outs for example.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "November 13, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "M - Mature", "developers": "Mucky Foot", "publishers": "Eidos", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.33", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_Chaos", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_5S9OiRpDQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/8022-urban-chaos\n"}
