{"altername_name": [], "name": "Spirit of Speed 1937", "overview": "A slight change from the normal excessive number of F1 games out there, Spirit of Speed 1937 was an attempt to put you into the driving seat of some of the oldest, and well known, racing cars of the early-century. Take control of one of the 1930s cars and race it out around tracks, many of which are no longer available for professional competitive racing. The game is a single player race around historic tracks in a single race or a full circuit.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "July 31, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Broadsword Interactive", "publishers": "LJN Entertainment", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.55", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_of_Speed_1937", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/10672-spirit-of-speed-1937\n"}
