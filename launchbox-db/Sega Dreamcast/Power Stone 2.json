This time, the top 2 from every round (in other words the two that survive each fight of 4 players) progress to the next round. And after a few rounds, you will battle it out with huge Bosses that take up most of the screen.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "August 23, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Capcom", "publishers": "Capcom", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.40", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Stone_2", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WnSLQEq1Js", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/3408-power-stone-2\n"}
