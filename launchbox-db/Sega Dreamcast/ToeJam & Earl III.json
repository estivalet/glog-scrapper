{"altername_name": ["ToeJam & Earl III: Mission to Earth", "ToeJam & Earl III"], "name": "ToeJam & Earl III", "overview": "ToeJam & Earl III: Mission to Earth is an action video game released for the Xbox on October 23, 2002. Developed by ToeJam & Earl Productions and Visual Concepts, and published by Sega and Microsoft, it is the third installment in the ToeJam & Earl series. Players assume the role of one of three extraterrestrial protagonists: ToeJam and Earl, who starred in the series' first two games, and Latisha, a new character. While using power-ups to combat enemies, players seek to collect the twelve \"Sacred Albums of Funk\" and defeat the antagonistic \"Anti-Funk\". The original two ToeJam & Earl games were a key Sega Genesis franchise, but development of a third game was prevented by the poor North American commercial performance of the console's successor, the Sega Saturn. Versions of ToeJam & Earl III developed at different times for the Nintendo 64 and Dreamcast were canceled, but the latter was completed for the Xbox. On release, the game met with poor sales and mixed reviews; while certain critics found its gameplay innovative, its humor, soundtrack and graphics were variously praised and derided. Opinions of the game's overall enjoyability and longevity were also mixed.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "ToeJam & Earl Productions", "publishers": "", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.07", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ToeJam_%26_Earl_III:_Mission_to_Earth", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/92398-toejam-earl-iii\n"}
