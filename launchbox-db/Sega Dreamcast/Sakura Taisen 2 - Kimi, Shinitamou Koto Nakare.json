Returning from a Pacific-to-Atlantic shakedown cruise, Ensign Ohgami is reassigned to lead the Hanagumi (\"Flower Division\") of the Imperial Assault Force (Teikoku Kagekidan), defending the capital from mysterious new demonic forces, this time with a curious relationship to the original \"Kouma War\" that devastated the city and sparked the formation of the Assault Force itself.
