Cyprien is helped and hindered through his quest by an assortment of strange beings, from an elephant named Wilbur, who makes his entrances and exits on a swing, a tribe of demis - creatures cut in half, a giant termite queen, a dark root, and many many more. He is not helpless in his battle against the odds however. He has brought along to this strange dimension Super-Cyp, his heroic alter ego, into whom he may change temporarily using the power-ups scattered around the levels.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "April 26, 2002", "game_type": "", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "In Utero", "publishers": "Ubi Soft Entertainment Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.89", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_Twin:_Cyprien%27s_Chronicles", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHjbJY8DPTE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/77013-evil-twin-cypriens-chronicles\n"}
