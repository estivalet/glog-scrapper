You control Max, a superhero with the ability to turn invisible and punch through walls, as he valiantly halts the plans of the diabolical John Dread. Gameplay is similar to Fighting Force 2, as you lead Max through expansive levels pummeling your foes with bare fists. The game also features voice-overs by the cast of the television show, adding dramatic flair to the proceedings.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "May 30, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Treyarch", "publishers": "Mattel Interactive", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.46", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Steel:_Covert_Missions", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/7832-max-steel\n"}
