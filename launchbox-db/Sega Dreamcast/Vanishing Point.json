{"altername_name": [], "name": "Vanishing Point", "overview": "Vanishing Point is an arcade style racer featuring real cars and road course style tracks. The main difference between Vanishing Point and countless other racers is that you are never racing directly against other cars, but rather are racing against the clock. Your position at the end of the race depends solely on your time, not on your finishing position relative to other cars. What's more, there are loads of computer controlled cars that are there simply to slow you down.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "January 3, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Clockwork Games", "publishers": "Acclaim Entertainment", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.08", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanishing_Point_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/18737-vanishing-point\n"}
