{"altername_name": ["Daytona USA 2001"], "name": "Daytona USA", "overview": "Just like the arcade version, pick one of three tracks (beginner, advanced, or expert) and either automatic or standard transmission. A pounding music soundtrack kicks in as you are slapped into your car to await the green light. The game offers both a traditional arcade mode with checkpoint time splits and a special PC mode that pits you against the other cars over different race distances. The PC mode also offers more car choices, with a variety of speed, acceleration, and grip characteristics. It even rewards successful players (meaning those finishing first, second, or third in the difficult setting) by offering up to ten more upgraded cars to drive. Once underway, the goal is to work from last to first as smoothly and quickly as possible", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "March 13, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Amusement Vision", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.17", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daytona_USA_2001", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/7467-daytona-usa\n"}
