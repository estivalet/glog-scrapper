{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sorcerian: Shichisei Mahou no Shito", "overview": "Another remake of the classic RPG Sorcerian this time exclusive to the SEGA Dreamcast. Once again you must take control of a party of 4 player-created adventurers and lead them through 10 scenarios from the original game and 5 new ones specially designed for this version in a side-scrolling fashion, each featuring a unique stand-alone quest for you to complete. The remake features for the first time in a Sorcerian game a fully polygonal engine, even if the game plays like a side-scroller while in the dungeons and from a top-down perspective in the town. Also included are new items, spells and job classes for your characters and the ability to enchant items and create your own spells while in town.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "April 27, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Falcom", "publishers": "Victor Interactive Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&v=0nGmV6Wcw7U", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/125034-sorcerian-shichisei-mahou-no-shito\n"}
