{"altername_name": ["Jet Set Radio"], "name": "Jet Grind Radio", "overview": "In the 21st century, the Tokyoto city government bans kids from expressing themselves in any way. Only three things keep their spirits alive: Overdriver magnetic-motor skates, graffiti, and a pirate-radio broadcast that's called Jet Grind Radio. Explore and, uh, decorate three fully interactive worlds in which traffic moves at real time and pedestrians wander the streets. Watch out for police who'll want to nab you for breaking the law, and rival crews that want to deface your artwork. The \"Cartoon Dimension\" art style gives the game the appearance of a 2-D comic, but the characters move through it in complete 3-D. Animations run at 30 frames per second. Ten characters are available at the outset, each of which has its own style and abilities.", "platform": "Sega Dreamcast", "release_date": "June 29, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Smilebit", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.30", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_Set_Radio", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ih2BoI0BH_Q", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/30-jet-grind-radio\n"}
