{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pinball Spectacular", "overview": "\"Pinball Spectacular\" is one of the first flipper simulations for the Commodore home computers. The game was delivered on cartridge. A speciality is the controls by paddle. The flipper simulation is a mixture of pinball and breakout. The square-cut ball is rolled over the pinball table with the help of a double board similar to Breakout. As pinball elements, there are -next to walls- also two bumpers (upper right and left), the Commodore logo (in the middle of the screen), the light C O M M O D O R E with the corresponding targets, two spinners, four sideways ball traps (middle and bottom) and a point display. Furthermore, there is a time-sensitive ball barrier to avoid the ball going into out. The overview line with ball display, active player and points is in the first line of the screen. You have 3 balls per game.", "platform": "Commodore MAX Machine", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "HAL Laboratory", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/99818-pinball-spectacular\n"}
