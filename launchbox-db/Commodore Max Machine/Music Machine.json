{"altername_name": [], "name": "Music Machine", "overview": "Music Machine Cartridge for the Commodore Max Machine. It allows you to produce music on the MAX Machine's SID chip (same one as the Commodore 64). Some history: the MAX Machine was a game machine developed prior to the Commodore 64 and sold only in Japan. Commodore made about 25 cartridges for the MAX machine, but since the system was largely a flop, few were produced and the cartridges are hard to find today. Because the Commodore 64 was designed with a MAX emulation mode, all MAX cartridges also work on the Commodore 64, SX64, and Commodore 128. Some were slightly repackaged and later sold in C64 markets.", "platform": "Commodore MAX Machine", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Commodore Business Machines", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/99810-music-machine\n"}
