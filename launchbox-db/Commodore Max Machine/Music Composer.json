{"altername_name": [], "name": "Music Composer", "overview": "Music Composer Cartridge for Commodore Max Machine (also works on the Commodore 64). The MAX Machine was a game machine developed prior to the Commodore 64 and sold only in Japan. Commodore made about 25 game cartridges for the MAX machine, but since the system was largely a flop, few were produced and the games are hard to find. Because the Commodore 64 was designed with a MAX emulation mode, all MAX cartridges also work on the Commodore 64. As sales were poor many were slightly repackaged and later sold on the Commodore 64 market.", "platform": "Commodore MAX Machine", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Andy Finkel", "publishers": "Commodore Business Machines", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/99806-music-composer\n"}
