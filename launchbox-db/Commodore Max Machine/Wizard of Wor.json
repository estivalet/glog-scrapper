{"altername_name": [], "name": "Wizard of Wor", "overview": "The player fights as a knight in different dungeons with magical projectiles against the monsters living there. The first monsters (\"hellhounds\") are still a bit slow. Suddenly appearing monsters get faster and faster and are partially invisible (but can be seen on radar). In later levels the player has to compete against the warlock \"Worluk\" and finally against the \"Wizard of Wor\". Furthermore, you have the possibility to fight with two against each other or against the monsters.", "platform": "Commodore MAX Machine", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dave Nutting Associates", "publishers": "Commodore Japan", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.33", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizard_of_Wor", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/99830-wizard-of-wor\n"}
