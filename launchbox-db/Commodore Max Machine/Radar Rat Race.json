{"altername_name": [], "name": "Radar Rat Race", "overview": "In Radar Rat Race the player plays the role of a blue mouse, that has to search for cheese in a labyrinth within a certain time. To make it a bit harder, you are followed by several red mice which bring you certain death when you crash into one of them. As the red mice outnumber you, you should take into account that you might get encircled by several mice. A further peril are the black cats, which lure behind some of the corners. Into those also the red mice can run, but they are only delayed by the cat and not killed. With a \"Star Screen\" - a trace of stars that can be left behind by the blue mouse - you can temporarily disable followers which are too close. When you have collected all the cheese in the labyrinth, you reach the next round. With every round the number of cheese slices and the enemy mice is raised. For a better orientation in the labyrinth there is a \"radar overview\" in the window on the right: Turquoise square: player White square: cheese slices Purple crosses: red enemy mice Unfortunately, the black cats are not shown on the radar.", "platform": "Commodore MAX Machine", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "HAL Laboratory", "publishers": "Commodore Business Machines", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar_Rat_Race", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/99820-radar-rat-race\n"}
