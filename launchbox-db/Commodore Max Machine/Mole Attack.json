{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mole Attack", "overview": "Mole Attack is one of the earliest computerized Whac-a-Mole variants. Gameplay should be clear: Moles randomly pop out of several holes (arranged in a 3x3 grid), and you can hit them using the right keyboard key (one for each hole). The sooner you hit the mole's head, the more points you get -- but if you hit the mole's buttocks (yes, them buggers sometimes pop up that way), you lose points. After 60 seconds, the game ends and your score is shown.", "platform": "Commodore MAX Machine", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "HAL Laboratory", "publishers": "HAL Laboratory", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mole_Attack", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/99799-mole-attack\n"}
