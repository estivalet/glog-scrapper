{"altername_name": ["A-Rank Thunder: Tanjou-hen", "A-Rank Thunder"], "name": "A-Rank Thunder Tanjouhen", "overview": "A-Rank Thunder Tanjouhen is an adventure game following the story of Yutaka Ran. He begins the story waking up with no memory. However, he quickly finds out that he was not only captured, but turned into a superweapon, able to harness electricity in moments of extreme duress. Now he must use his powers to find a way to stop those who would use him in their plans. A-Rank Thunder Tanjouhen has a strong focus on narrative, and its mechanics are designed to facilitate that. Players progress through the story by speaking with key NPCs, and occasionally fight combatants through a rudimentary card-based battle system. The most notable aspect of play is the Live Interactive Picture system: during dialogue, the player may be asked to manage Yutaka's emotional state through dialogue choices. He will perform better or worse in the combat systems depending on the player's choices.", "platform": "Sega CD", "release_date": "June 25, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Riot", "publishers": "Telenet Japan", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-Rank_Thunder_Tanjouhen", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyGoJiOnL8E", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/80153-a-rank-thunder-tanjouhen\n"}
