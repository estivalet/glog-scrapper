{"altername_name": [], "name": "Surgical Strike", "overview": "The elite Special Forces unit, The Surgical Strike Team, have been called into action. High-tech urban guerrillas are attacking innocent people but once they're done with their carnage they fade back into the landscape. In a very delicate way, the Team must find these hidden enemies and get rid of them without harming innocent citizens. Inside your hovercraft, you can charge at the violent creatures, turn 180 degrees to watch your own back and explore new uncharted areas. You have a choice of weaponry choose the 30MM Gatling gun or the laser-guided rockets. AWACs C-130's hover above and give you pointers, plus on-board mapping allows you to zero in on hidden emplacements.", "platform": "Sega CD", "release_date": "June 1, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "The Code Monkeys", "publishers": "Sega Enterprises", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.39", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_Strike_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/718-surgical-strike\n"}
