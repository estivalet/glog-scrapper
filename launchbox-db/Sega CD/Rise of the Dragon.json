{"altername_name": ["Rise of the Dragon: A Blade Hunter Mystery"], "name": "Rise of the Dragon", "overview": "Rise of the Dragon is a futuristic first-person adventure game. The game's visuals are reminiscent of a comic book, with digitized photos of actors and hand-painted backgrounds. Unlike most other adventure games of the time, it relies less on inventory puzzles and more on specific choices made by the player. The game has an internal clock and requires the player to plan the protagonist's moves ahead in order to be in the right place at the right time. Dialogues with multiple choices are utilized as a gameplay tool; a wrong choice will often lead to a premature end of the adventure.", "platform": "Sega CD", "release_date": "September 25, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Game Arts", "publishers": "Dynamix", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.66", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rise_of_the_Dragon", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4829-rise-of-the-dragon\n"}
