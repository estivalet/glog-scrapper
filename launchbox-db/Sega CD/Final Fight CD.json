{"altername_name": [], "name": "Final Fight CD", "overview": "The Sega CD version, titled Final Fight CD, was ported and published by Sega under license from Capcom in 1993. This version retains nearly all the features of the arcade game (namely the 2-player game mode, the Industrial Area stage, and the ability to play as any of the three main characters), adding voice acting to the game's opening and ending sequence, an arranged version of the original soundtrack, and an exclusive time attack mode. The Sega CD version was still censored for the English localization with many of the same changes. Poison and Roxy were kept this time, but were redrawn with less revealing clothing (longer shorts and shirts) to hide all nudity", "platform": "Sega CD", "release_date": "April 2, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "A Wave", "publishers": "Sega Enterprises", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.27", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fight_(video_game)#Mega-CD/Sega_CD_(Final_Fight_CD)", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvUjyjWcGHo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4760-final-fight-cd\n"}
