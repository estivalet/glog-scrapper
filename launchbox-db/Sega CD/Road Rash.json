{"altername_name": [], "name": "Road Rash", "overview": "Road Rash for Sega CD is another title in the series, this time it's an attempt to mate the classic gameplay of Genesis Road Rash games with full-motion video and avant-garde rock soundtrack. This game was released the same time with the famous 3DO Road Rash. And it borrowed a lot of content from the Panasonic 3DO version: all the FMV videos, CD-quality soundtrack and overall menu design. The quality of FMV and music is inferior to 3DO version given the limitations of Sega CD hardware. Graphically and gameplay-wise the game is a continuation of Road Rash II for Sega Genesis.", "platform": "Sega CD", "release_date": "April 1, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Monkey Do Productions", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.82", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_Rash_(1994_video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hP5OcMf_vGw&feature=youtu.be&t=194", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4831-road-rash\n"}
