{"altername_name": [], "name": "Johnny Mnemonic", "overview": "Johnny Mnemonic is a cancelled adventure game for the Sega CD. A prototype has since been found. The game consists of live-action video footage and interactive sequences, some of which play like adventure game segments and may contain simple puzzles, while others are more action-oriented. Johnny's bodyguard Jane often handles the fighting episodes; the player can assign buttons to punches and kicks. The adventure parts contain limited exploration and interaction with the environment, and mostly serve to advance the plot.", "platform": "Sega CD", "release_date": "April 1, 1995", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Propaganda Code", "publishers": "Good Deal Games", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Mnemonic_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/116466-johnny-mnemonic\n"}
