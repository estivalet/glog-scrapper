{"altername_name": ["The Secret of Monkey Island: Monkey Island Yurei: Kaizoku Oosoudou!", "Monkey Island: Yuurei Kaizoku Daisoudou!"], "name": "The Secret of Monkey Island", "overview": "The Secret of Monkey Island is an adventure game that utilizes the command verb-based SCUMM interface first introduced in Maniac Mansion: the player constructs commands for Guybrush by selecting an appropriate verb and then combining it with an object or an inventory item. Objects that can be interacted with are highlighted when the player places a cursor over them. The game is the first LucasArts adventure in which it is impossible to get irrevocably stuck; like in Loom, the player character also cannot die. The branching dialogue system, where the player chooses between several available responses during conversations, allows the player to talk to characters in different ways without fearing a wrong choice, and is often used as a humorous device.", "platform": "Sega CD", "release_date": "December 1, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Lucasfilm Games", "publishers": "JVC Musical Industries", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.21", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secret_of_Monkey_Island", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4833-the-secret-of-monkey-island\n"}
