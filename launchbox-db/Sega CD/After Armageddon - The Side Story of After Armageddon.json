{"altername_name": ["After Armageddon Gaiden: Majuu Toushouden Eclipse"], "name": "After Armageddon: The Side Story of After Armageddon", "overview": "After Armageddon Gaiden: Majuu Toushouden Eclipse is a side story to Last Armageddon. Because of the release of the Saturn this title was never brought outside Japan. Like Last Armageddon, this game is a turn-based RPG in which the player controls a group of demons in a post apocalyptic world. The story takes place in the future, hundreds of years after the extinction of mankind due to a nuclear holocaust. Demons are the rulers of the planet now, but they are engaged in battle for the dominion of the earth by some aliens/robots. The gameplay is similar to Final Fantasy and nearly identical to Last Armageddon. Battles are turn based and, like in Last Armageddon, blocking prevents all the damage from the enemy.", "platform": "Sega CD", "release_date": "November 11, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Pandora Box", "publishers": "Sega Enterprises", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.21", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/33914-after-armageddon-the-side-story-of-after-armageddon\n"}
