{"altername_name": ["Hisaichi Ishii's Great Political World"], "name": "Ishii Hisaichi no Daiseikai", "overview": "Ishii Hisaichi no Daiseikai (Hisaichi Ishii's Great Political World) is a farcical political-themed strategy board game based on the works of cartoonist Hisaichi Ishii. The player takes the role of a budding politician who must work his way up to become the Prime Minister of Japan. The game is completely menu driven, with the player choosing actions for each day as the game progresses, such as visiting a certain place or meeting with a specific person. The ultimate goal is to gain experience solving citizens' problems and earn enough popularity campaigning -- or by using items to swing public opinion in the player's favor -- to win the popular vote.", "platform": "Sega CD", "release_date": "January 28, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "G-Sat", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/34024-ishii-hisaichi-no-daiseikai\n"}
