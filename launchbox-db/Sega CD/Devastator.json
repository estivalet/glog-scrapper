{"altername_name": [], "name": "Devastator", "overview": "The game's story is based on a mini-anime series, with extracts from the anime being used for cutscenes between the levels. The story centers on a man named Ryo, who begins working for a company called Yaesu as a replacement for his friend Masato. During a test ride with a new machine, however, he is somehow thrown into another dimension. After being rescued there by a group of mecha pilots from vile creatures named Devastators, he learns that nefarious people are working on a connection between that and his own dimension, and sets out to stop them. Devastator is a run & gun-style platformer with shoot-'em-up segments. The player controls a humanoid mech with a mid-range weapon, which can be described as a sickle on a chain, and one of three different long-range weapons. The goal in each level is simply to reach the end and defeat a boss. Most of levels consist of platforming, but sometimes the gameplay switches to a horizontally scrolling shoot-'em-up. Weapons can be upgraded by collecting items left by defeated enemies, similar to the Turrican games, but the protagonist may only have one long-range weapon; picking up another replaces the old one. There is only one type of standard upgrade item. To select a weapon, the player has to shoot the power-up until it shows the correct symbol.", "platform": "Sega CD", "release_date": "May 28, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Wolf Team", "publishers": "Wolf Team", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.71", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83289-devastator\n"}
