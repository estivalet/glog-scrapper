If no rival appears in your way, you will have total freedom to advance to the rival goal, and when you find it appropriate, stop the game in order to make an action, and then it will appear a menu asking you if you want to pass, shoot or make a special move (depending on how high your guts counter is).", "platform": "Sega CD", "release_date": "September 30, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tecmo", "publishers": "Tecmo", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.36", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Tsubasa_(Mega-CD_video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITP2GNMbJmA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/33930-captain-tsubasa\n"}
