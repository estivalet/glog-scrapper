{"altername_name": [], "name": "Night Striker", "overview": "Night Striker (\u30ca\u30a4\u30c8\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30ab\u30fc) is an arcade game developed by Taito. It is a futuristic on-the-rails shooter which plays similarly to Sega's Space Harrier, though has you pilot a hover vehicle instead. The game was brought to the Sega Mega-CD in 1993, where graphically it was downscaled for the weaker hardware. It was also brought to the Sega Saturn as Night Striker S (\u30ca\u30a4\u30c8\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30ab\u30fc\uff33) in 1996 - essentially the same game, but with an extra \"Saturn Mode\" and a few small enhancements. No versions have ever left Japan.", "platform": "Sega CD", "release_date": "May 28, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Aisystem Tokyo", "publishers": "Taito", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.9", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/34022-night-striker\n"}
