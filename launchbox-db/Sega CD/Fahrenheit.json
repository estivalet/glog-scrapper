{"altername_name": [], "name": "Fahrenheit", "overview": "Fahrenheit is an interactive movie that puts players into the flame-resistant suit of a firefighter. You are the new guy in the firehouse. Last week, you saved three lives. But now, you're on a new squad, and have to prove yourself to them. Like most interactive movies, Fahrenheit is played entirely while watching a digitized video. At certain critical points in the video, players must press certain directions on the control pad or action buttons in order to progress in the game. Fahrenheit takes this a step further by providing several buildings in which the player has the ability to move from room to room in in a non-linear fashion. As players move from room to room, they have to locate victims and neutralize fire hazards.", "platform": "Sega CD", "release_date": "March 1, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "SEGA Studios", "publishers": "Sega Enterprises", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.06", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit_(1995_video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113408-fahrenheit\n"}
