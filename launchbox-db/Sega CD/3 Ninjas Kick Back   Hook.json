{"altername_name": ["3 Ninjas Kick Back"], "name": "3 Ninjas Kick Back / Hook", "overview": "3 Ninjas Kick Back / Hook, for lack of a better name, is a compilation for the Sega Mega-CD released exclusively in North America. It contains CD versions of the Sega Mega Drive games 3 Ninjas Kick Back and Hook. 3 Ninjas Kick Back was never released as a stand-alone game for the Mega-CD, so the enhanced audio can only be found in this compilation. Furthermore it contains fully voiced video cutscenes that explains the current objective, as well as new first person 3D-style stages involving rollerblading and hanggliding, using the same engine as the Mega-CD versions of Cliffhanger and Batman Returns. Hook is presumed to be identical to its regular Mega-CD counterpart.", "platform": "Sega CD", "release_date": "February 28, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Malibu Interactive", "publishers": "Sony Imagesoft", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.07", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3_Ninjas_Kick_Back_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4679-3-ninjas-kick-back-hook\n"}
