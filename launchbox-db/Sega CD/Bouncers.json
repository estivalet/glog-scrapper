{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bouncers", "overview": "Arcade basketball game where YOU are the ball. You can't jump high enough on your own to go through the hoop, so you must bounce off other players. Supports up to four simultaneous players. There are eight characters to choose from, powerups (and powerdowns) that affect your speed and jumping ability. Games can turn into fighting matches of sorts, as players can kick each other to get their opponent in the air. With practice, you can learn to shoot three pointers and slam dunk yourself into the basket.", "platform": "Sega CD", "release_date": "December 1, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Dynamix", "publishers": "Sega of America", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.89", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouncers_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaOx8e7P1fA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4689-bouncers\n"}
