{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dungeon Explorer", "overview": "Dungeon Explorer is an action role-playing game. It supports up to four players with a choice of six different character classes: monk, knight, elf, mage, beast and ninja. The game starts in the area surrounding a save point. This area functions as a central hub to access all the six dungeons. If a character leaves it, the food counter starts decreasing. If it reaches zero, the life points start diminishing until the character dies. Food can be found as potions or pots around the mazes. Returning the character to the save point area replenishes all the counters and cures all conditions (like poisoning and confusion). The gold collected in the game can be spent on equipment upgrades at the weapons shop. The tavern allows the player to switch characters.", "platform": "Sega CD", "release_date": "May 1, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Hudson Soft", "publishers": "Sega of America", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.42", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_Explorer_(1995_video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_2xnR59eUY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/422-dungeon-explorer\n"}
