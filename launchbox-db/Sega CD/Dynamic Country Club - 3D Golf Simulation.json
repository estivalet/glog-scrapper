Both floppy disk-based and ROM board-based versions of the game exist. The game presents itself in a pseudo-3D setting a la T&E Soft golf games like Pebble Beach Golf Links where the screen slowly redraws itself at certain intervals in your swing. A game with the same name for the Sega Mega-CD was produced, but only released in Japan. Whether or not this is the same game is unknown.", "platform": "Sega CD", "release_date": "July 16, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega AM3", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/34001-dynamic-country-club-3d-golf-simulation\n"}
