{"altername_name": [], "name": "Battletech: Gray Death Legion", "overview": "The Gray Death Legion is a mercenary regiment within the Battletech universe. This game demo does not have audio, but is very playable and a blast at that! The game plays very similar to the excellent AH-3 Thunderstrike. Battletech: Gray Death Legion makes use of the Sega CD's scaling and rotation hardware to create an impressive 3D environment with a smooth frame rate. Features a very long 3D animated Battletech intro that is also very impressive.", "platform": "Sega CD", "release_date": "January 1, 1994", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Imagineering", "publishers": "Absolute Entertainment", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.29", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109733-battletech-gray-death-legion\n"}
