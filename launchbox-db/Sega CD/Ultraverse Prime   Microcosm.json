{"altername_name": ["Ultraverse Prime"], "name": "Ultraverse Prime / Microcosm", "overview": "Players control the superhero Prime, a thirteen year-old boy called Kevin Green that has the power to transform into a superhero adult version of himself. Prime can punch, kick and jump, and combine these into some new moves and combos. The player as well as the enemies can also occasionally find weapons or objects to pick up and throw. Some stages are much faster as Prime flies at a fast speed and needs to punch obstacles and enemies out of the air.", "platform": "Sega CD", "release_date": "January 1, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Psygnosis", "publishers": "Malibu Interactive", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.77", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4857-ultraverse-prime-microcosm\n"}
