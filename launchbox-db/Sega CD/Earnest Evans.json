{"altername_name": [], "name": "Earnest Evans", "overview": "In the 1930s, a man known as Earnest Evans had learned of three ancient idols which hold enough power to destroy the Earth. Evans had decided to search the world to find the scattered idols, but was injured before he could find all three. Now, many years later, his grandson, Earnest Evans III, continues his grandfather's quest to save humanity from total annihilation. However, a rival treasure hunter named Brady Tresidder also seeks the idols to bring the world's destruction. Evans must find the treasures before Tresidder does. During his journey, Evans stumbles upon the beautiful young green-haired girl Annet Myer lying in some ruins in Peru who decides to accompany him for the rest of his adventures. The two encounter a mysterious figure by the name of Sigfried, who has unknown motives, but seems to know a lot about Hastur and his cult.", "platform": "Sega CD", "release_date": "December 20, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Wolf Team", "publishers": "Wolf Team", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.95", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnest_Evans", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gz5sYERRYdo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/24781-earnest-evans\n"}
