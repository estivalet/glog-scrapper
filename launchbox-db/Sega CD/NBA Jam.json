Each human player controls a single player, so choose your squad wisely to take team-mate skill into account. The game is action-oriented, and players can perform unrealistic slam-dunks. Full performance statistics are automatically recorded. The play clock and 3-point line apply, but other rules are largely overlooked.", "platform": "Sega CD", "release_date": "December 20, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Iguana UK", "publishers": "Acclaim Entertainment", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.96", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Jam_(1993_video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4811-nba-jam\n"}
