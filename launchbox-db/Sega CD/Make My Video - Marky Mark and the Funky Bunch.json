{"altername_name": ["Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch: Make My Video"], "name": "Make My Video: Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch", "overview": "Make My Video: Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch is a video game based on real-time editing of music video footage. The setup is that a brother and sister pair is arguing about what would make the best Marky Mark video. Since they can not agree, they enlist help from some other people: A boxer and his trainer, a trio of teenage girls, the members of a garage band, and their parents. Each group has their ideas about what an ideal Marky Mark video should or should not contain. The specifications normally come in the form of a set of pictures they either do or don't want to see, and perhaps some effects. The game has three Marky Mark videos from which to choose: \"Good Vibrations\", \"I Need Money\", and \"You Gotta Believe\".", "platform": "Sega CD", "release_date": "January 1, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Digital Pictures", "publishers": "Sega of America", "genres": "Music", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.7", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_My_Video#Marky_Mark_and_the_Funky_Bunch", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4803-make-my-video-marky-mark-and-the-funky-bunch\n"}
