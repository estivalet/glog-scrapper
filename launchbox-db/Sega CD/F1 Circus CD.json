{"altername_name": [], "name": "F1 Circus CD", "overview": "F1 Circus CD is a Formula 1 racing game featuring an official FIA license. The game features a first-person driver's view perspective, and is the only title in Nichibutsu's long-running franchise to feature neither the original top-down view nor the bird's eye view introduced in Super F1 Circus 2. The game includes four different race modes: - Exhibition gives the choice of five different types of F1 cars from the '60s through to the '90s, which can be driven on the Tokyo GP course. -Test Drive gives the choice of any team from the 1991-1993 seasons, and two dozen different courses to freely practice or run as a time trial. - Formula Mega lets the player start on the Formula 1 circuit as a new driver, working their way up the ranks by winning races and using the earnings to upgrade and purchase vehicles. - F1 World Championship is the main feature, and lets the player take part in a grueling 16-race season, attempting to win the world championship.", "platform": "Sega CD", "release_date": "March 8, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nichibutsu", "publishers": "Nihon Bussan", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.26", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/34027-f1-circus-cd\n"}
