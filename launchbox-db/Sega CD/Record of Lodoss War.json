{"altername_name": ["Lodoss-tou Senki: Eiyuu Sensou", "Lodoss Jima Senki: Eiyuu Sensou"], "name": "Record of Lodoss War", "overview": "Based on the novel series by Ryo Mizuno, this version of Record of Lodoss War has the same premise and main characters as the TurboGrafx CD version, but it is a completely different game. Like the earlier TurboGrafx CD version, it focuses on the adventures of the novel cycle's main hero Parn, his best friend Etoh, and the lovely high elf shaman Deedlit, but concrete events and locations are entirely different. Instead of the more traditional Japanese RPG-style world map top-down navigation and random battles, this version has a linear world map and pre-set battles. The strategic element of the battles is stronger, since the battle screens are larger and it is not possible to set battles on auto. Each attack is shown graphically on a separate screen. Hostile areas have standard top-down navigation, while towns are viewed from first-person perspective, and the navigation in them is menu-based. The game has voice acting and real anime movie sequences instead of the usual 2D cut-scenes characteristic for anime-style Sega CD games.", "platform": "Sega CD", "release_date": "December 20, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kogado Studio", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_of_Lodoss_War", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/34025-record-of-lodoss-war\n"}
