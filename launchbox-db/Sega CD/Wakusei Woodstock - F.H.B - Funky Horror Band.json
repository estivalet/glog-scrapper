{"altername_name": ["Wakusei Woodstock: Funky Horror Band"], "name": "Wakusei Woodstock: F.H.B: Funky Horror Band", "overview": "The Funky Horror Band is a group of six extraterrestrial musicians who spread a message of peace and love through the timeless stylings of '80s pop music. However, after they are chased off their home planet of Horahora, their rocketship crash lands on another planet, where a young boy from the nearby village of Funky finds the wreckage and the band inside. They must work together to repair the band's ship... and their instruments, of course! Funky Horror Band is a so-called \"Musical RPG\" divided into five chapters. The gameplay is relatively simple, in the traditional JRPG style typified by Dragon Quest, though certain story sequences are presented in a visual novel style with large portraits and voiced dialogue. Character customization is limited to changing equipment, as there is no experience or leveling system in the game.", "platform": "Sega CD", "release_date": "December 20, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega Enterprises", "publishers": "Sega Enterprises", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/34006-wakusei-woodstock-fhb-funky-horror-band\n"}
