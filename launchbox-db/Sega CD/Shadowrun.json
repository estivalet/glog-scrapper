{"altername_name": [], "name": "Shadowrun", "overview": "Shadowrun for Sega CD is a little-known game (and one of the very last ones released for this console) that is based on the FASA RPG of the same name and has only very little to do with its much more popular brethren for SNES and Genesis. It is twenty-first century, and the humanity faces a difficult period that follows devastating wars and other disasters. Magic and technology co-exist, supernatural powers, mythical creatures, ghosts, cyberspace, where hackers meet and fight each other, street deckers which can be hired to do the dirty work, anarchy and struggle between mighty and corrupt corporations - this is the world of Shadowrun. Unlike the two other Shadowrun games which are set in Seattle, according to tradition, Shadowrun for Sega CD is set in the futuristic city of Neo Tokyo. The player controls a party of characters with different backgrounds: the street samurai Rikudo, the shaman girl Mao, the decker (a hired mercenary) D-Head (who also happens to be an elf), and Shiun, a former member of a mighty corporation. Their first assignment is to hunt down a ghostly warrior who has been disturbing a segment of the city for quite some time. As the player begins their investigation they plunge deeper into the dark world of intrigues and find themselves fighting on different fronts.", "platform": "Sega CD", "release_date": "February 23, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Compile", "publishers": "Compile", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.53", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadowrun_(1996_video_game)", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKzt8YU24OU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/23095-shadowrun\n"}
