You must blast through bars and bank robberies to take the gang out and save everything you regard as good and true. Where the game differs from other Operation Wolf-influenced shoot-'em-ups is in the use of live video, with real people appearing on the screen before you shoot them down. You have unlimited continues with which to reach the end, so the actors will have their screen deaths seen by as many people as they would had they starred in a film.", "platform": "Sega CD", "release_date": "January 1, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "American Laser Games", "publishers": "American Laser Games", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.84", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Dog_McCree", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4800-mad-dog-mccree\n"}
