{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mighty Mighty Missile!", "overview": "Mighty Mighty Missile! for the Sega Mega-CD is an unlicensed clone of ChuChu Rocket!, which was originally released on the Sega Dreamcast. The game closely mimics the presentation and gameplay of Sonic Team's earlier releases, including stages adapted from both the Dreamcast and Game Boy Advance versions. The mechanics of Mighty Mighty Missile! are largely identical to those of its parent game. Players have indirect control over the Mousers (the equivalent of ChuChu Rocket!'s ChuChus), whose trajectories must be modified through the placement of arrow tiles. The goal is to direct the Mousers past a variety of obstacles, including the Catz (KapuKapu) in their path to the missiles (rockets).", "platform": "Sega CD", "release_date": "January 1, 2005", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "FVRING", "publishers": "Good Deal Games", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/122864-mighty-mighty-missile\n"}
