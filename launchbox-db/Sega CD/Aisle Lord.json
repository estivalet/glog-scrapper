{"altername_name": [], "name": "Aisle Lord", "overview": "Aisle Lord is a 3D dungeon RPG in the tradition of western RPGs such as Wizardry and Might and Magic, though the story and character progression is much closer to Japanese style RPGs with a fixed cast that levels up automatically. The entire game, including towns and building interiors, is explored from a 3D third-person perspective; individual rooms and transitional areas are navigated in a point-and-click adventure game style. Battles play out in a semi-active fashion, with the player giving each character specific commands, which they will follow until instructed to do otherwise.", "platform": "Sega CD", "release_date": "May 29, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Wolf Team", "publishers": "Telenet Japan", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.58", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/33915-aisle-lord\n"}
