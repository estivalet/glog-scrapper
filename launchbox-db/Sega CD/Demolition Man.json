{"altername_name": [], "name": "Demolition Man", "overview": "Demolition Man is a fast-paced platform game, with some levels taking place in an overhead perspective (similar to Smash TV). As John Spartan, the player will spend most of his time shooting endless waves of \"cryocons\" released upon the antiseptic world of the future. The standard weapon can be upgraded with a shotgun and magnum, both with limited ammo. Additionally, various types of grenades can be collected, which are thrown independently of the firearm. Simon Phoenix appears as a boss character at the end of every level that is directly tied in with the movie.", "platform": "Sega CD", "release_date": "November 15, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Alexandria", "publishers": "Acclaim Entertainment", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.04", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demolition_Man_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4701-demolition-man\n"}
