{"altername_name": [], "name": "A10 Bomber", "overview": "A10 Bomber is a variant of the arcade game Scramble. It's a side scrolling shoot 'em up where the player has to fight off the forces of something called the Zelons and ultimately destroy their globe fortress which is supposed to stop their assault on the solar system. Like in the original Scramble, the plane automatically advances over a mountainous terrain and the player has to watch out for or shoot down missiles that are launched from the ground. Two weapons are available: a machine gun that shoots bursts of fire forward and bombs which are dropped towards the ground. Fuel is limited and the plane will crash if it runs out. It can be refilled by dropping bombs on fuel stations on the ground. In addition to missiles there are outer dangers such as asteroids, mines and different fighters.", "platform": "EACA EG2000 Colour Genie", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ipswich Software Factory", "publishers": "Ipswich Software Factory", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151674-a10-bomber\n"}
