You must get past the flocks of birds guarding the way, avoiding the Sloorinian indestructible missiles and killing as many birds as possible. Once inside the breeding ground you must collect and incinerate the eggs. The game is in two stages. Stage One: you control a ship armed with a KIL-O-ZAP. The ship may be flown in any of 8 directions using the arrow keys. The gun may be fired by pressing the arrow keys and the space bar simultaneously. Stage Two: At the top of the screen is an area of dotted lines. This is a safe area and the only place where the eggs can be destroyed.
