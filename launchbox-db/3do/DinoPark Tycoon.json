{"name": "DinoPark Tycoon", "overview": "The objective in DinoPark Tycoon is the successful administration of a dinosaur park. Players start off with a $5,000 loan in the retail version, or a $20,000 loan in the school version.  The money is used to pay for the land, dinosaurs, fencing, food and employees necessary to run the park and pay back the loan; failure to meet loan payments results in the park's foreclosure.  Once the loan is paid off, players may expand the park and earn profits. If players are confused, an animated dinosaur appears and guides the players through the game.", "platform": "3DO Interactive Multiplayer", "release_date": "January 1, 1994", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Manley & Associates", "publishers": "MECC", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.28", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzkk5qISW4g", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/13896"}
