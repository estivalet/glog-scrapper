{"name": "Bust-A-Move", "overview": "Bust-A-Move (also known as Puzzle Bobble) is a real-time puzzle game in which the player controls a device called \"pointer\" at the bottom of the screen, aiming and releasing randomly colored bubbles upwards. Depending on the aiming, the bubbles may float up directly or bounce off the walls, changing their trajectory. The goal is to aim the bubbles in such a way that they will touch identically colored ones. When such bubbles form a group of three or more, they pop and disappear from the screen.", "platform": "3DO Interactive Multiplayer", "release_date": "January 1, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Taito Corporation", "publishers": "Matsushita Electric Corporation of America", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.65", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cNfUMmxkCg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/9701"}
