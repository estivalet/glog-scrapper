{"name": "The Daedalus Encounter", "overview": "The interstellar war is over, leaving you, a casualty, as a disembodied brain inside a life support system. Your buddies rescue you from the lab so that you can go exploring - scavenging the galaxy for wreckage and artifacts left over from the war. In due course you stumble literally into an alien craft. With your own craft disabled, and the alien ship on a collision course, you must explore it to find out what has gone wrong and to make a course correction. <br><br>Gameplay consists of conversations with your colleagues (displayed as live action video), animated exploration sequences, as well as puzzle-solving that mostly involves figuring out how to operate alien mechanisms. There is also a maze sequence and sporadic action-based tasks. There is no inventory to speak of, because, being a brain in a box. you have no pockets.<br><br>All the action takes place in an in-game window that is your view of the world. It takes up only a small part of the screen and the rest of the screen is taken up with a kind of fleshy 'inside of your head' background that is there to remind you that you are inside a machine. Three difficulty settings, in-game instruction and assistance, as well as a few extras (such as high-resolution pictures) are included.", "platform": "3DO Interactive Multiplayer", "release_date": "January 1, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Mechadeus", "publishers": "Matsushita Corp", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.99", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idDCtDsrEkk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4627"}
