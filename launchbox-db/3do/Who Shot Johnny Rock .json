{"name": "Who Shot Johnny Rock?", "overview": "Another live-actor arcade shooter by American Laser Games (makers of Mad Dog McCree and Crime Patrol), Who Shot Johnny Rock is set in the classic 1920's style gangster era.<br><br>As the title suggests, you're supposed to find out who shot singer Johnny Rock (or at least who hired the guys who shot him) and put them behind bars.<br><br>There are some differences between this game and previous American Laser Games shooters. Instead of a wimpy pistol, you get a tommy gun (which doesn't need to be reloaded). Unfortunately, you also have limited ammo and need to buy more at times. Instead of lives you have a fixed supply of money, and each time you die you lose some cash. Lose it all and it's game over.", "platform": "3DO Interactive Multiplayer", "release_date": "January 1, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "American Laser Games", "publishers": "American Laser Games", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.95", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koAGuSmnFAQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/9770"}
