{"name": "PO'ed", "overview": "PO'ed is a first-person shooter with two simple objectives: escape the alien homeworld and kick lots of butt! There are 25 levels in all, each with a challenging array of horrific aliens to destroy, switch puzzles to solve, and platforming elements. Ox can either walk throughout the levels or utilize an ultra-powerful jetpack; use the latter in moderation as it's an important, yet limited tool.", "platform": "3DO Interactive Multiplayer", "release_date": "November 17, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "M - Mature", "developers": "Any Channel", "publishers": "Accolade", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.27", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woRqgOZSy28", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/11299"}
