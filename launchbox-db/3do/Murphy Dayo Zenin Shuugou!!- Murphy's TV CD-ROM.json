{"name": "Murphy Dayo Zenin Shuugou!!: Murphy's TV CD-ROM", "overview": "Murphy Dayo Zenin Shuugou!! is a quite unusual Japanese only game. It is dedicated to the laws of Murphy, the so-called laws of meanness. Which means, if there is the slightest chance that something goes wrong, then it certainly will go wrong. Even more unusual are the graphics in the game which are drawn in the style of MS Paint pictures.", "platform": "3DO Interactive Multiplayer", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Panasonic Interactive", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/47670"}
