{"name": "Dragon's Lair", "overview": "Dragon's Lair features the hero, Dirk the Daring, attempting to rescue Princess Daphne from the evil dragon Singe, who has locked Princess Daphne in the foul wizard Mordroc's castle. The screen shows animated cutscenes, and the player executes an action by selecting a direction or pressing the sword button with correct timing, requiring the player to memorize each scenario in order to clear each quick time event. The comedy aspects of the game stemmed not only from the bizarre looking creatures and humorous death scenes, but also the fact that while Dirk was a skilled knight, he was somewhat clumsy in his efforts, as well as being a reluctant hero, prone to shrieking and reacting in horror to the various dangers he encounters.", "platform": "3DO Interactive Multiplayer", "release_date": "January 1, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Advanced Microcomputer Systems", "publishers": "ReadySoft Incorporated", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRC-pfcOKXQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/5569"}
