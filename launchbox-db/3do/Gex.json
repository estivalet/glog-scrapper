{"name": "Gex", "overview": "Enter your television to defeat the evil Rez by collecting remotes to open worlds inside your tv. You are a gecko with all the usual platform hero skills such as jump, fire and close range attack, but also suction cups to help you scale walls, a tongue to pick up those tricky to get power-ups and plenty of wise-cracks to keep you amused. Use them all to make your way through TV land searching for the remotes, collecting pickups, power-ups and killing TVs.", "platform": "3DO Interactive Multiplayer", "release_date": "November 16, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Crystal Dynamics", "publishers": "Crystal Dynamics", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.31", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pn7_Fo9HTvA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4590"}
