{"name": "Penn & Teller's Smoke and Mirrors", "overview": "Penn & Teller's Smoke and Mirrors is an unreleased video game that was planned for release initially on the Sega CD in April 1995 and to be followed by PC and 3DO versions later that year. The game stars the comedy-magician duo Penn & Teller. The game is composed of several minigames and an adventure/platform game starring Penn & Teller. All the minigames, with one exception, were made for the sole purpose of enabling the owner of the game to fool their friends by many different means, designating the games \"scam minigames\" and virtual tricks. Penn & Teller's Smoke and Mirrors is unofficially the video game equivalent of Penn & Teller's Cruel Tricks for Dear Friends video, which has the same purpose, and uses properties of the video medium itself for the tricks. One of the games most infamous mini-games is Desert Bus, this is considered by Penn to be the \"best part\" of the collection, Desert Bus is a trick minigame and a featured part of Electronic Gaming Monthly's preview. The objective of the game is to drive a bus from Tucson, Arizona, to Las Vegas, Nevada, in real time at a maximum speed of 45 MPH. This is often cited by critics as being one of the worst games of all time.", "platform": "3DO Interactive Multiplayer", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Imageneering", "publishers": "Absolute Entertainment", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGMJCsXYZZU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/80663"}
