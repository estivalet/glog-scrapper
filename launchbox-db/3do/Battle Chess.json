{"name": "Battle Chess", "overview": "Battle Chess is a quite typical chess game, but it comes with a twist: all pieces are represented by small, realistic figures that walk around on the chessboard, and when one piece takes another, they both take part in an animated battle. There is a different animation for each permutation, depending on which pieces are capturing or being captured. You can also play in 2D without animation. <br><br>The game's opening library includes 30,000 different moves, ensuring a variety of games will unfold across the 10 skill levels. <br><br>Multi-player support can be extended to modem and/or serial port play.", "platform": "3DO Interactive Multiplayer", "release_date": "January 1, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Interplay", "publishers": "Interplay", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.66", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hvLlnTS0Wg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4578"}
