{"name": "Theatre Wars: Goraku no Dendou", "overview": "Theatre Wars is an eccentric theatre management simulator. Divided into several stages, players are entrusted with running a theatre and putting on strange spectaculars to satisfy different requirements. Players have a budget to work within, which has to be spent on set design, dancers, and music selection. If their show performs well, players can make their budget back and then some - but if their show reviews poorly, they'll go bankrupt and might even see their theatre demolished to build a parking lot.", "platform": "3DO Interactive Multiplayer", "release_date": "May 14, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Scitron & Art", "publishers": "Hamlet", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/80974"}
