{"name": "ToonTime ...in the classroom", "overview": "Cartoons are more fun than ever! ToonTime provides multimedia entertainment for children, as well as adults who are still young at heart. ToonTime... In the Classroom brings to your television a whole new method of interactivity never before available. Select randomly from six classic full color cartoons: Tweety, Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Popeye, Elmer Fudd and Superman, and play the chosen cartoon immediately (no more rewinding a videotape). Have fun manipulating the digitized cartoons by shrinking, enlarging, twisting and distorting them inside a classroom. Have more fun playing the cartoons on different classroom objects. Reshape and distort the objects as they bounce around the classroom.", "platform": "3DO Interactive Multiplayer", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Videoact V", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/79971"}
