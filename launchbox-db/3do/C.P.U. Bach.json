{"name": "C.P.U. Bach", "overview": "C.P.U Bach is not what would be typically considered a video game. There are no challenges and no goals presented to the player. C.P.U Bach can more easily understood as a software program that allows the user to assist the program in creating music. The user does not create music directly. Instead, the user selects from a set of variables, including type of music and instruments. The software produces a musical concert from the variables selected. The music created is unique to the variables selected, and is not pre-recorded. The game was intended to show the power of computers to create music with a limited amount of user input. Imitating the style of the famous composer Johann Sebastian Bach was thought to make it especially impressive.", "platform": "3DO Interactive Multiplayer", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "MicroProse Software, Inc.", "publishers": "MicroProse Software, Inc.", "genres": "Music", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbGO0a5P0M8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/59299"}
