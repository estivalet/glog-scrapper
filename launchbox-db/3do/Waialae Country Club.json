{"name": "Waialae Country Club", "overview": "Grab your clubs and head for the first tee. This golf sim recreates the world famous Hawaiian Waialae Golf Course, noted for lots of bunkers and very fast greens. You can choose your golfer, assign him a caddy, pick your set of clubs and adjust the power, putting, technical, recovery and wind game stats to suit your personal preference. The game offers a practice training mode, a tournament mode and the ability to challenge your friends in a stroke match. Oddly, this game was not sanctioned by the PGA and assumes that the golfer is always male.", "platform": "3DO Interactive Multiplayer", "release_date": "January 1, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "T&E Soft", "publishers": "Panasonic Interactive", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxCT1QPmZOk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/9769"}
