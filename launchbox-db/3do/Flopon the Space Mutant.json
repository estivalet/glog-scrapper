It is a wacky twisted puzzle game with odd graphics and sound. Also includes some crazy mini-games. I recommend the title, it's one of my favorites on the 3DO. Can be played without knowing Japanese.", "platform": "3DO Interactive Multiplayer", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Warp", "publishers": "Warp", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/81018"}
