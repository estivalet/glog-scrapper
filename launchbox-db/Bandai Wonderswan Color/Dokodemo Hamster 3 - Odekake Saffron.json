{"name": "Dokodemo Hamster 3: Odekake Saffron", "overview": "This is the third in Bandai's \"hamster simulation\" series. In this game, you are the \"master\" of a hamster. The game flows in real time, but you can interfere and perform various actions. The hamster has its own room in a house, with a table and a wheel. There are many things you can do with the hamster. You can take in to a stroll in the forest, go shopping with it, make it play with a ball, and so on. You can also perform actions unrelated to the hamster, like re-decorating the house or writing and painting on a piece of paper.", "platform": "WonderSwan Color", "release_date": "December 14, 2000", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "BEC", "publishers": "Bandai", "genres": "Life Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.38", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27923\n"}
