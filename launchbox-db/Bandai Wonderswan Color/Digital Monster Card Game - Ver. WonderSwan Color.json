Except for some effects, the same rules as the actual card game are adopted, so that beginners can play as an introductory card game and experienced people can play as a practice game. The rules of the game are almost the same, but of course the seasoning unique to the Wonderswan Color version is also made. About 70 types of effects are prepared during battles, and the powerful production will boost the battle. In addition, characters may appear during the battle and gently teach the rules.", "platform": "WonderSwan Color", "release_date": "March 16, 2002", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tom Create", "publishers": "Bandai", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27922\n"}
