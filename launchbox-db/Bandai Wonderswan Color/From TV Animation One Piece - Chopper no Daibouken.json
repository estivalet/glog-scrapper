{"name": "From TV Animation One Piece: Chopper no Daibouken", "overview": "One day, the Straw Hat Pirates travel to a mysterious island. While the Straw Hats explore around the island, they all suddenly turn into animals; Luffy into a monkey, Zoro into a tiger, Sanji into a fox, Nami into a cat, Usopp into a kappa, and Robin into a parrot. Only Chopper remains as he was. It is up to Chopper to not only help the crew to turn back to their original state, but to also figure out the cause of their mysterious transformation. The gameplay is standard action RPG; enemies wander the landscape and you can choose to attack or ignore them. You can also use the 'defend' button to reduce the damage inflicted by an unexpected attack.", "platform": "WonderSwan Color", "release_date": "October 16, 2003", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "TOSE", "publishers": "Bandai", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.88", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27927\n"}
