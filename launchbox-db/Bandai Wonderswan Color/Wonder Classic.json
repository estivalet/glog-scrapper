{"name": "Wonder Classic", "overview": "Wonder Classic is a golfing game where you will use different characters with specific abilities to your advantage. For example the character, Reiko Nagase nullifies the effects of wind, most others have certain benefits to certain types of shot. There are two starting characters and twenty-two unlockable and downloadable characters. The gameplay of Wonder Classic includes the ability to use the Y-buttons to augment just how your club will come in contact with the ball, to subtlety alter its trajectory. You'll also have six \"Power Shots\" which will have to be carefully conserved in each match. Using the WonderGate you could get new clubs as well as stat altering equipment, such as gloves. You also could get new characters and courses through the WonderGate as well. This feature also allowed you to see your score as part of a \"global\" ranking.", "platform": "WonderSwan Color", "release_date": "January 18, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Yoshidayama-Workshop", "publishers": "Bandai", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.86", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/19033\n"}
