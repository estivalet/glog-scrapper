It is now in the hands of the unscrupulous titan, Death-Adder. Tarik, the seasoned warrior whose skill with his giant sword is both praised and feared throughout the land, has come forth to try and wrest the Axe from the grasp of the black-hearted warlord. Help Tarik to battle the many types of bandits that Death-Adder has amassed to protect himself. Using the sword, and certain very special magical powers, guide Tarik through the gauntlet of bandits to Death-Adder's castle! He'll be waiting there for you, and he's terribly reluctant to give up the Golden Axe! Are you brave enough to bring back the Axe, and thus restore tranquility to Yuria, or will you wind up just another victim of the evil warlord?", "platform": "WonderSwan Color", "release_date": "February 28, 2002", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bandai", "publishers": "Bandai", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.8", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27934\n"}
