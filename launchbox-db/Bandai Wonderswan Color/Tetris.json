{"name": "Tetris", "overview": "Tetris is one of the great many versions of the famous soviet block-stacking game. Pieces made up of four blocks (dubbed \"tetriminoes\") fall into a 10x20 square well, and must be arranged into complete lines, which then vanish and clear more space on the board. As lines are cleared, the game speed increases until either the tetriminoes reach the top of the well or the player completes the goal for the current mode. This version features three single-player modes: Marathon mode, which continues until the player loses; 40 lines mode, which is a race to complete 40 lines; and 3 min mode, where the goal is to earn as many points as possible within a 3-minute time limit. There is also a 2-player versus mode which uses the WonderSwan's link cable, much like the Game Boy version.", "platform": "WonderSwan Color", "release_date": "April 18, 2002", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Vanguard Works", "publishers": "Vanguard Works", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27982\n"}
