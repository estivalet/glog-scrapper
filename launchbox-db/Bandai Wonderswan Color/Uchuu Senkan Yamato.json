{"name": "Uchuu Senkan Yamato", "overview": "Each of the game's 17 levels plays like an episode with text interchanges and battles (fought both in space and on various planets) that alternate between tactical moves and short cutscenes to show the results. There are also 8 new scenarios plugged in to freshen up the story with new enemies such as a hotshot Gamilas commander to rival General Lysis, a space creature or two and a game version of the little-known manga spin-off, Eternal Story of Jura. Depending on performance and points earned, multiple endings are possible including one that incorporates the \"Hologram Starsha\" scene from the Yamato movie.", "platform": "WonderSwan Color", "release_date": "February 8, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tom Create", "publishers": "Bandai", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27983\n"}
