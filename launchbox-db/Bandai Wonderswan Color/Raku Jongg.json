{"name": "Raku Jongg", "overview": "Raku Jongg is a puzzle game that combines falling-block mechanics of Tetris with the rules of Mahjong, based on a winning entry in ASCII's 1998 Entertainment Software Contest. Mahjong tiles drop in pairs from the top of the screen, and lining up three of the same type in a row will cause them to be removed from the board. Combinations are added to the player's hand at the bottom of the board, and completing a hand will add to the player's score. Several different modes are included, including a Story mode, 2-player versus mode, ranking test, and time attack.", "platform": "WonderSwan Color", "release_date": "May 31, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Enterbrain", "publishers": "Bandai", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27963\n"}
