{"name": "Inuyasha: Kagome no Sengoku Nikki", "overview": "Inuyasha: Kagome no Sengoku Nikki is a \"Fureai Adventure\" where the player becomes the heroine Kagome Higurashi and communicates with Inuyasha. The story of Inuyasha changes depending on how the players interact. The game is divided into the \u201cInuyasha Forest\u201d part that contacts with Inuyasha using commands such as \u201cItem\u201d and \u201cTopic\u201d, and the \u201cSearch\u201d part that advances the story while adventuring with friends. If you do many events that occur in the \u201cExploration\u201d part, the topics and items in the \u201cInuyasha Forest\u201d part will increase, and the interaction with Inuyasha will become even more fulfilling. In addition, since the clock is built in the cassette, the game progresses in real time while linking with the actual time. Of course, many famous scenes of the original are recorded during the game, and familiar characters and enemy monsters appear. There are many original episodes such as the appearance of the original character \u201cItachi no Shippu\u201d as a rival to Inuyasha. You can also review stories in the \u201cAlbum Diary\u201d and enjoy mini-games such as \u201cHide and Seek\u201d.", "platform": "WonderSwan Color", "release_date": "November 2, 2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bandai", "publishers": "Bandai", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27944\n"}
