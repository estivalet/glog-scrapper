{"altername_name": [], "name": "Heroes Arena", "overview": "In this game players bounce and bash an energy ball back and forth across the arena into the opponent's territory trying to hit the capsules set up along his back wall. Players are wielding a large shield which they must use to hit the energy ball. Whenever the ball hits a capsule, it is destroyed and points are scored by the opponent of the capsules' owner. On the other hand, if the ball hits the player's body, he will be stunned for a while.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Imanok", "publishers": "MSX Cartridge Shop", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "8", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148741-heroes-arena\n"}
