{"altername_name": [], "name": "Quebert", "overview": "A Q*Bert clone, not straying very far from the original implementation. The pyramid is here, unlike many other clones, a proper pyramid, and the bouncy little Fuzzball must jump from block to block, changing its colour, while avoiding the balls that come dropping down the pyramid. After a while, a purple ball enters the game, that ball hatching a dangerous snake that will not just drop down, but can also jump up on the pyramid, hunting the Fuzzball. Outside of the pyramid are discs, which can be used as emergency lifts which drop you on the top of the pyramid again.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Eurosoft", "publishers": "Premium III Software Distribution", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/105316-quebert\n"}
