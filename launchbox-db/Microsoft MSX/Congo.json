{"altername_name": [], "name": "Congo", "overview": "In this Donkey Kong variant, you must move from the bottom of the screen to the top to save your loved one from the giant ape at the top. You must guide your player from left to right and up and down while jumping over barrels that the ape is throwing down. Unlike Donkey Kong the levels are all different. Some are just straight forward run and jump, but others have lifts and disappearing ladders (now you see them now you don't). Also through the levels are more aliens to jump over and more things to collect to kill aliens, such as a hammer and an umbrella.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Livewire", "publishers": "Livewire", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/103122-congo\n"}
