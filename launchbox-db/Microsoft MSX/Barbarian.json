{"altername_name": [], "name": "Barbarian", "overview": "Barbarian is a 1987 computer platform game by Psygnosis. It was first developed for the Atari ST, and was ported to the Amiga, Commodore 64, DOS, MSX, Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum. In the game, the player is Hegor, a barbarian who must traverse several dungeons and underground habitats to defeat his brother, the evil sorcerer Necron. He has a sword and bow in his arsenal of weapons. Running and jumping, as with many platform games, comprises a large part of the gameplay of this title. The game used a unique control system to make up for lack of more than one joystick button on many systems. The player would first press the one button after which a \"menu\" of actions would appear along the bottom of the screen. The player then selected the desired action by cycling through the choices with the joystick and then pressing the button again when the desired action was highlighted.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Icon Design", "publishers": "Dro Soft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.88", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbarian_(1987_video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7sw66tPMh8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/45660-barbarian\n"}
