The game takes place in two stages, in which we will control Columbus, but also other personages related to the story. In the first stage we must build the boat, with the help of all people who supported us, looking for a valiant crew and finally buy all the food and belongings that we need, provided we have enough money. The second stage involves crossing the ocean, until reaching the new continent. During this stage we can take control of each crew members to handle the boat, quell fires, narrow water, sewing sails, and so on. The adventure will end once we reach the new lands.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "OMK Software", "publishers": "Gem S.L.", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/103307-el-descubrimiento-de-america\n"}
