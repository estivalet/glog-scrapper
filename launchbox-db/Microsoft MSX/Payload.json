{"altername_name": [], "name": "Payload", "overview": "In this driving game you control a freelance Japanese lorry driver. Who is responsible for his own freight and only gets payed at delivery. In this game it's all about control and management. You can choose your own contracts. You have to deliver your good on time. Any delay will be deducted from your commission. Delivering the goods on time can be quite a challenge. If you overload your truck the police will fine you if they order you to stop. The police will also fine you if you exceed the speed limit or don't stop at a traffic light when it's red. The gasoline and truck repairs - in case of an accident - are expensive.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Zap", "publishers": "Sony", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/105212-payload\n"}
