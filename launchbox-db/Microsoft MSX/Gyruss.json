{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gyruss", "overview": "Way back in 1984, Parker Brothers released the game Gyruss, which was a conversion from the 1983 Konami arcade game by the same name, for the Colecovision. Gyruss is a semi 3D, or tube shooter that resembles games like Feedback and Space Harrier. Now, almost 28 years later, we finally get to play this game on MSX because GDX made a conversion from the Colecovision version. The conversion is based on the Mission Colecovision emulator for MSX and features some nice improvements such as SCC sound by default and improved support for keyboard and joysticks.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "2017", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Parker Brothers", "publishers": "Repro-Factory", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW4BA94LQgI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75814-gyruss\n"}
