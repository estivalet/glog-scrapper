{"altername_name": ["Ninja Ky\u016bseishu", "\u5fcd\u8005\u6551\u4e16\u4e3b"], "name": "Ninja Savior", "overview": "STORY There is an ancient tale about the old and peaceful village of Usuki in Japan. One terrible night, the town was attacked by deadly ghosts and monsters. To defeat them all and bring peace again, the Ninja Savior was summoned for him to defeat the evil forces and save the village from destruction. HOW TO PLAY You find yourself climbing the walls of the houses, trying to defeat the evil forces with spells. Your character will slowly fall down, so you must be quick and jump to the other wall in front of you not to be burnt with the fire beneath! In your jump you\u2019ll need to evade ghosts and mosters that can hurt you and try to pick up paper spells and scrolls to damage the big enemy at the top. You\u2019ll succeed when the energy bar at the bottom reaches the \u201cO\u201d symbol in the right side. Beware being hurt because the energy bar will reduce. Also, when you land on a wall, you will be damaged. If the energy bar at the bottom reaches the \u201cX\u201d symbol in the right side, you\u2019ll lose a live! Try defeating big enemies for extended play!", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "2015", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Relevo Videogames", "publishers": "RELEVO Videogames", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/130820-ninja-savior\n"}
