{"altername_name": ["Come On!"], "name": "Kinasai!", "overview": "The game is basically a clone of the Universal arcade game Space Panic. You control your character with a shovel who can walk on the various floors of bricks and climb ladders while avoiding touching the aliens which results in death. You dig pits with your shovel and if an alien falls into it you must quickly hit the trapped alien with your shovel a few times to defeat it. The cyan colored aliens however require you to make them fall through two consecutive pits to dispose of them.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Hudson Soft", "publishers": "Hudson Soft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/103918-kinasai\n"}
