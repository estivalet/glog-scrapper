{"altername_name": [], "name": "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom", "overview": "The computer versions of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom are conversions of the Atari arcade game based on the second movie in the series. As Indy, the player must complete several cycles of the following three types of levels: Mine level: Whip your way through a mine in order to free children that are held captive. Use your whip to swing across chasms, climb ladders, ride along conveyor belts and defend yourself against attacks from Thuggee guards, bats, snakes and the fireball-throwing Mola ram. Escape with the mine cart after you've freed all children. Mine cart level: Pick the right route through a network of tracks while riding in a mine cart. Avoid potholes, broken tracks & guards in carts and safely reach the end of the track. Temple level: Make your way to the altar and grab the Sankara stone while Mola Ram, bats and Thuggee guards attack you. Watch out for that lava. With every cycle the mine & mine cart levels become more complex, the layout of the temple levels is always the same. After several cycles there's a showdown with Mola Ram on the rope bridge.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atari Games", "publishers": "Erbe Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Temple_of_Doom_(1985_video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo6yYm2ZfJ8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/89508-indiana-jones-and-the-temple-of-doom\n"}
