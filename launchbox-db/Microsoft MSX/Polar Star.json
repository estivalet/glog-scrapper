{"altername_name": [], "name": "Polar Star", "overview": "Humanity's last outpost is under attack. Our only hope is a desperate strike against the alien foe to destroy as many of their fortresses as possible. Polar Star is a shoot-em-up game with a repetitive series of levels. Each level consists of two stages. The first stage is to guide your craft along the surface of the planet towards the enemy fortress, avoiding attacks by UFOs from the front and rear. You can shoot forwards during this stage to destroy your enemies. As you approach, the fortress slowly appears on the horizon. Once it has been reached, the second stage starts. The goal of this stage is to power up a missile, and launch it at a small moving white bay-door which is the vulnerable point of the fortress. While powering up, which takes about 30 seconds, the craft is unable to fire its other weapons and must dodge all enemies and their incoming fire. If you miss the bay door with the missile, the next missile is powered up. The process is repeated until either you or the fortress are destroyed.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Microcabin", "publishers": "Microcabin", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/105288-polar-star\n"}
