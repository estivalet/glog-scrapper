You know you have to fulfill a mission, you know it's not going to be easy. However, you will do your best, because if you succeed, the spirit of your father, Merlin the magician, will come out of the thousand-year-old oak and all the power of him will be transmitted to you. You remember, as you prepare for combat, your escape from the house of your adoptive parents. Also, the rage that invaded your young body when you learned of Nimiane's betrayal comes back to your mind. The lady of the lake, she paid your father. She tricked the king of wizards, captivating him with her beauty, convinced him to teach him all her magic, and then she turned on him! You are the son of Merlin, called Gareth, and today you will shed blood, send souls to the darkest hell and save your father. You will use physical and magical weapons. Nothing should stop you. It is not for nothing that two years have passed since the escape, it is not for nothing that you have trained in swordsmanship, you have learned to hit using all your strength, you know how to throw Bland balls. It is not for nothing that you have read forgotten books on sorcery, you have managed to master necromancy and now the power of the dead accompanies you with all its mysterious magic.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Zigurat Software S.L.", "publishers": "Zigurat Software S.L.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.38", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/105292-power-magic\n"}
