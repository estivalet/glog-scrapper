{"altername_name": [], "name": "Nausicaa", "overview": "Based on the acclaimed 1984 Hayao Miyazaki movie. The basic gameplay involves attempting to pilot a gunship. Time passes as you fly over the green land, occasionally passing a God Warrior's skull. A simple, jaunty, tune plays through out and is accompanied by the solitary sound of your cannon. At the start of the round you'll need to sucessfully take off. Pressing up or down causes the ship to continually float in that direction until you tap the opposite direction. Left and right increase the speed but be careful not to slow too much or you'll stall and crash.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Technopolis Soft", "publishers": "Technopolis Soft", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/104670-nausicaa\n"}
