{"altername_name": [], "name": "Block Tower", "overview": "When the game starts, it will be in a paused state, so press the space key to start the game. Stack the blocks in the same way as the \"Sample\" on the right to proceed the game. Please move the \"guide\" with the right and left of the cursor key and select the block with the space key. However, it may not always be possible to select the target block, so in such a case, stack blocks of the same color in two layers. If you do so, the two will disappear, so it should be easier to select the block. In addition, the blocks of white color change to blocks of other colors. When placing the top block, it must be a block with the same color as the sample. If they are all piled up in the same way, they will be successful, and they will be the same game again. The blocks are arranged randomly, but the difficulty level does not increase.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Eight-Iron", "publishers": "MSX-FAN", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/132098-block-tower\n"}
