{"altername_name": [], "name": "U-Do", "overview": "After positioning the ball with the cursor keys, the game starts. At this time, if you do nothing, the starting point will always be the upper left. Guide the ball to the goal at the corner of the diagonal from the starting point of the ball. The ball is always moving, but hit the spacebar where you think it is. If you do so, the paths that the ball will follow will be different combinations (3 types). Use this game well to get the ball in the game. This is a fairly difficult game, but even if it succeeds, the difficulty level will not increase.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "MSX-FAN", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133101-u-do\n"}
