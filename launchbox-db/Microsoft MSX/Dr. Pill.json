{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dr. Pill", "overview": "Doctor Pill is a large mini game. A small and fairly simple game idea, but with a lot of media to give shape to this idea. In its basic concept, Dr.Pill is a simulation of a doctor\u2019s office where the player deals with infections, symptoms and pills. While in real life this would sound like a simple day job, the same process in this game is hindered by a few embarrassing aspects: The patients are a collection of halfwits who may have some absurd complaints. Dr.Pill, a doctor sent from hell, is extremely impolite, rude and sadistic. His paycheck is his only reason to stick to the job, otherwise he would surely prescribe his patients a high dose of cyanide. The pills which Dr.Pill can buy and prescribe aren\u2019t the best pills around. Many have side effects and not all of them are known. ..and you, the player, are the one to take up the role of Dr.Pill!", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "2009", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "", "developers": "Infinite", "publishers": "MSXdev", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/143542-dr-pill\n"}
