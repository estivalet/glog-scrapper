{"altername_name": [], "name": "Solo", "overview": "You're Carlitos, the usual school boy who still has to hear the recommendations of his mother. Everything was going fine until someday you left your home and found a deserted street, but almost instantly you heard the sound of a grenade exploding, and some bad guys with a shotgun. You think of it as a nightmare, but then a bullet almost hits you. Just then you find a pistol in your bag, if these dudes are real, why shouldn't it be real too? Solo is another of the Opera games designed to be used with the Gun Stick, quite similar on its development to Opera's Trigger. Also, in spite of this game's solitary name, there will be the option to play a 2 players cooperative mode.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Opera Soft", "publishers": "Opera Soft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/368500-solo\n"}
