Fortunately, you can strike back against the monsters by smashing them flat, by smashing them on the head. Don't linger too long, though, since they are soon resurrected, white and unsquishable. Squish 'Em is similar to Crazy Climber, with much faster gameplay.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sirius Software", "publishers": "ASCII", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squish_%27em", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bU-xpp0QVc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/131382-squish-em\n"}
