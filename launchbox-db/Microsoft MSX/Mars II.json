{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mars II", "overview": "Just as you are flying Earth's ambassadors into the city of Canalus, hostilities with the Martians break out again and you come suddenly under attack by MAM missiles. Your goal is to make it past all of the dangers that are thrown at you across five Sectors, and destroy the enemy base. Mars Mission II is a sequel to the vertical scrolling shoot-em-up Caverns of Mars. However, in this game the screen scrolls horizontally with gameplay more closely resembling that of the arcade game Scramble. You control a spacecraft with a forward firing gun, which may be used to destroy the various missiles and mines that get in your way. You can also shoot fuel depots, which will replenish your fuel, which would otherwise drain at a constant rate. Running out of fuel will cause the loss of a life. You may also lose a life if you collide with an enemy or with the terrain. There are five different sectors in any given game: the country-side, the minefields of Chron, the Suburbs of Canalus (fuel is scarce here), downtown Canalus and the underground maze. At the end of the fifth sector, a hexagonal base will appear, which must be shot to complete the level. Once this is done, the game loops back to the beginning but at a higher difficulty.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Nagi-P Soft", "publishers": "Nagi-P Soft", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/104271-mars-ii\n"}
