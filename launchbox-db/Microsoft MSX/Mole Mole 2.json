{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mole Mole 2", "overview": "The follow-up to Mole Mole plays exactly like the original, which means that it is very close to Boulder Dash but at a slower pace, since each move requires planning, whereas falling boulders won't kill you. Three difficulty levels are on offer: Selections, Children and Experts. Your mole, while digging tunnels in the earth to collect each and every item on-screen before proceeding to the exit, can neither jump nor dig upwards, which is what makes careful planning of your tunnels necessary. To your aid, you have a map screen which shows the entire level in a zoomed-out format. The same screen is also used for the built-in level editor.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Cross Media Soft", "publishers": "Victor", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/104486-mole-mole-2\n"}
