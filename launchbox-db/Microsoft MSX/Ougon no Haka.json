{"altername_name": ["Golden Tomb"], "name": "Ougon no Haka", "overview": "This is commercial release of the Grand-Prix winning title in Magical Zoo's first \"Adventure Contest\". The standard version was the disk release for the PC-6001, but at the time the low number of users with a floppy drive (due to its prohibitive cost) led the publisher to insist that the authors write a tape version, which was obviously reduced in content. The cassette version was marketed with the implication that if you wanted to play the full version, you ought to buy the disk release. This led to the inevitable criticism from both users and magazines that the tape version was little more than a demo, but at full price. By way of apology, Magical Zoo released a sequel \"\u7d9a\u30fb\u9ec4\u91d1\u306e\u5893\". Obviously, the tape version in its reduced state is much easier than the original game and to see the true ending the player has to actually play the sequel as well.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Stratford Computer Center", "publishers": "MagicalZoo", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138923-ougon-no-haka\n"}
