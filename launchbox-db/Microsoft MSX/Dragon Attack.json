{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dragon Attack", "overview": "Dragon Attack is a vertical shoot-em-up for the Sord M5 and MSX computers. The game seems a mix between Space Invaders and Centipede, pitting the player against snake-like dragon enemies that split apart when hit. Otherwise, the game play very similarly to Space Invaders, with a crab-like protagonist (i.e. laser base), helping friendly clouds (i.e. bunkers), and a bizarre UFO analogue that can only be described as being the shape of a bell.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Takara", "publishers": "HAL Laboratory", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uhd6qgKaUww", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/82937-dragon-attack\n"}
