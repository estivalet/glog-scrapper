{"altername_name": [], "name": "Malaika", "overview": "Suddenly the peaceful Prehistoric World became attacked! Some strange creatures from outer space were invading every single corner in the planet. What could they do? Malaika, the young princess of the Prehistoric World decided it was enough! There were aliens everywhere: in the fields, in the woods... also, big spaceships were floating everywhere with nasty sounds and filling the air with pollution. Said and done! Malaika steps ahead in front of danger, and starts her solo fight against the invasor. Would you help her to succeed? In this game, prequel to Karoshi\u2019s Malaika Prehistoric Quest, Malaika will find different scenarios where she must defeat every enemy around. When every foe is finished, you will be able to proceed. Malaika's attack is based on the bone in her hair: she can shoot it to a certain distance so she can stun enemies. Once they are stunned, you can run over them in order to kill 'em. But be sure not to touch them when they are awake and kickin'! There are lots of hidden items at every scenario. Try to find where they are located, as they are pretty useful! Most of them gives you points, but some of them can feature certain effects.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "2013", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "RELEVO", "publishers": "Matra", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151944-malaika\n"}
