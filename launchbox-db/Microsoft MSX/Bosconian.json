{"altername_name": ["Bosconian Star Destroyer"], "name": "Bosconian", "overview": "The object of Bosconian is to score as many points as possible by destroying enemy missiles and bases. The player controls a small fighter ship that can move in eight directions, and can fire both forward and backward. Each round consists of a number of green enemy bases that must all be destroyed to advance to the next round (a semi-transparent automap helps identify their location). Each station consists of six cannons arranged in a hexagon, surrounding a central core. The player must either destroy all six cannons or shoot the core to destroy a station, and in later rounds the core is capable of defending itself (opening and closing while launching missiles). Additionally, the player must avoid or destroy stationary asteroids, mines, and a variety of enemy missiles and ships which attempt to collide with his or her ship. Enemy bases will also occasionally launch formation attacks \u2014 destroying the leader causes all remaining enemies to disperse, but destroying all enemies in a formation scores extra bonus points. A spy ship (worth a random bonus value) will also appear occasionally, which must be destroyed or the round will go to \"condition red\" regardless of how long the player has taken.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Namco", "publishers": "Namcot", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosconian", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QR49c3Vjz-c", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/76508-bosconian\n"}
