{"altername_name": ["Exa Innova"], "name": "E.I.", "overview": "This is an important game for the shooters-genre on the MSX-system, because this is the first game in which the enemy forces react to your actions, although not on the same level as in Zanac, instead of just following a simple procedure. This \"intelligence\" system would be worked out far better in the Zanac and Aleste games. Some Zanac and Aleste enemies can already be seen here.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Programmers-3", "publishers": "Sony", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.08", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83059-ei\n"}
