{"altername_name": ["Abadia del Crimen, La"], "name": "La Abad\u00eda del Crimen", "overview": "La abad\u00eda del crimen (The Abbey of Crime) is a computer video game programmed in 1987 by Paco Men\u00e9ndez. The game was originally conceived as a version of Umberto Eco's book The Name of the Rose. However, Paco Men\u00e9ndez and Opera Soft received no reply from Eco in order to secure the rights for the name, so the game was released as La abad\u00eda del crimen. The graphics were made by Juan Delc\u00e1n. This game is a videoadventure with 3D isometric graphics, where a Franciscan friar, William of Occam (William of Baskerville in the book) and his young novice Adso have to discover the perpetrator of a series of murders in a medieval Italian abbey.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Opera Soft", "publishers": "Opera Soft", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.62", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Abad%C3%ADa_del_Crimen", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRHqZYGvzJA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/43926-la-abadia-del-crimen\n"}
