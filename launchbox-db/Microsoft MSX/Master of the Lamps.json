{"altername_name": [], "name": "Master of the Lamps", "overview": "Master of the Lamps casts you as an Eastern prince hoping to become King. There are two distinct gameplay sections, through which he must prove his worthiness. Firstly, you must ride a magic carpet, flying through a series of diamonds which twists and turns more as you move through the 41 levels. Alternating with this, you are in front of a row of pipes. Hit a gong 3 times to summon a genie, who will play a sequence of notes. Once the last one has been played, they fly towards you in order, and their colour equivalent on the row must be hit (the number of times they are played), before the flying note can hurt you. Complete this and a piece of lamp is granted.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Activision", "publishers": "Activision", "genres": "Music", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_the_Lamps", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/97640-master-of-the-lamps\n"}
