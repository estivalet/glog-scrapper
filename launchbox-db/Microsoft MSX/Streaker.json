{"altername_name": [], "name": "Streaker", "overview": "You are a streaker with not a stitch on you, in the streets. As you go from room to room you must try and collect as much of your clothing as possible; the more clothes you find the more areas of the game you can go to. You can pick items up such as food to keep your energy up; some shops will only open at different times to make things difficult. Be quick to find your clothes or they can get pinched.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Mastertronic", "publishers": "Bulldog Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138953-streaker\n"}
