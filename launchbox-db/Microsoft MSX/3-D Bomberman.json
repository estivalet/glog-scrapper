{"altername_name": [], "name": "3-D Bomberman", "overview": "The game is essentially a remake of the original Bomber Man, but from a first-person perspective. It resembles many early \"3D Maze\" games that manipulated 2D backdrops and sprites to give the illusion of a 3D environment. This change makes it far more difficult for the player to gain situational awareness of the map, the range of bombs, and the position and movement of Barom enemies. Additionally, indestructible walls have been changed to look identical to destructible ones, which might be due to limitations in the graphics engine", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hudson Soft", "publishers": "Hudson Soft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.94", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo0ZgH7PTdY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/99679-3-d-bomberman\n"}
