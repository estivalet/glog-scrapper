{"altername_name": [], "name": "Illusions", "overview": "A puzzle game which takes place in three-dimensional environments with a surreal perspective, reminiscent of certain drawings with optical illusion by Maurits Cornelis Escher, in particular the impossible stairs and the impossible cube. We must succeed in merging four small creatures called Speeps into a single entity called Peep. Lizards pursue them in order to bite them. Only the jars filled with water will stop the lizards.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nice Ideas", "publishers": "Nice Ideas", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/103816-illusions\n"}
