{"altername_name": [], "name": "Yellow Submarine", "overview": "Yellow Submarine is a variant of the submarine game, one of the oldest versions of which is the Atari 2600 game Air-Sea Battle(1977). The premise is that the player, as captain on a submarine, must shoot at mine-releasing surface ships and sub-hunting planes, all the while avoiding enemy submarines and their torpedoes. The key to playing the game correctly is to properly time the missiles/torpedoes, as well as taking their trajectory into account.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Takeru", "publishers": "TAKERU", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJK4mwRQbbc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/131398-yellow-submarine\n"}
