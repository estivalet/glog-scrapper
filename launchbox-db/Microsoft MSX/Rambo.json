{"altername_name": [], "name": "Rambo", "overview": "You start off in the middle of the battlefield wielding only a knife, which you use by running into enemies and jamming the attack button, hoping they die before you do. If you explore around, you can find other weapons like arrows and machine guns, which can be used for a limited amount of times. Although you regenerate health by standing still for a few seconds, you'll constantly be running out of food if you dawdle, and you can only take a few hits anyway. The game world isn't very big, but you get to hop into a canoe, find keys, avoid snakes, and generally rummage around to find whatever items you need to beat the game.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Pack-In-Video", "publishers": "Pack-In-Video", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.8", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/96879-rambo\n"}
