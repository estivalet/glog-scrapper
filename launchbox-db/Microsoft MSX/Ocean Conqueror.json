{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ocean Conqueror", "overview": "As a submarine pilot within a war, your task is to destroy enemy munitions convoys in your sector. There are eight destroyers and four transports to destroy, within a time limit of 18 hours. You are armed with torpedos and guided missiles (upon firing one, control inputs are applied to the missile, rather than the ship). You also have a long range radar and a static map with co-ordinates. Controls are complex, with the periscope and rudder coming under your direct control.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Rack-It", "publishers": "Rack-It", "genres": "Vehicle Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138922-ocean-conqueror\n"}
