{"altername_name": [], "name": "Yie Ar Kung-Fu (2 Player Version)", "overview": "This version of Yie Ar Kung-Fu contains some significant differences compared to the versions directly ported from the original arcade release. For once, the hero of this game is not Oolong, but a fighter named Lee, inspired in appearance by the famous martial artist. All the opponents in this version are different as well; beside bearing other names, many of them also exhibit different fighting styles - for example, there is a character who throws fireballs, another one who can fly, etc. Altogether, there are only five possible opponents in this release, as opposed to ten in the other version. There is only one location (background) in the game, a kung-fu training hall. Gameplay-wise, this version retains the basic system of the original; however, due to the reduced number of opponents, there are less moves in the game. A distinct addition is a jump kick, and the ability to bounce off the walls. In this hack, you will get a neat 2 player mode, which greatly enhances the amount of fun you can have with this MSX1 classic.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "2006", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Adriano", "publishers": "MSX.org", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOdzh_lraUk&t=32s", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/369741-yie-ar-kung-fu-2-player-version\n"}
