{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ice World", "overview": "This game plays very much like a mix between the classic Sega arcade game Pengo and that old brain teasing favourite Sokoban. In Ice World you play as mallet wielding mouse who must move around a maze avoiding enemies and trying to slot two Tetris like blocks together. The maze is mostly made up of indestructible blocks but there are also some that can be pushed around the screen or melted by hitting them with your hammer.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Casio", "publishers": "Casio", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83019-ice-world\n"}
