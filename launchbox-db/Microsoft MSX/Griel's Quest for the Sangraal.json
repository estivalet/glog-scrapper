{"altername_name": [], "name": "Griel's Quest for the Sangraal", "overview": "Griel's Quest for the Sangraal is an MSX1 remake of the old MSX2 puzzle game, Griel no Seihai by Momonoki House, first published in Peach Up magazine 1990. The gameplay is similar both to Soukoban and the Lolo games, though the focus is not on moving boxes around. Instead, you are a knight who must pick up magic objects to vanquish evil creatures. The following objects can be found: Magical Staff \u2013 Vanquishes RPG slimes. Holy Cross \u2013 Vanquishes ghosts. Sacred Sword \u2013 Kills ogres. Only one magical object may be carried at any one time, and it cannot be dropped. The only way to get rid of an object is to use it against an enemy. Just as in the aforementioned puzzle games, the emphasis is therefore on picking up objects in the right order. This can get very tricky not only if a monster is in front of a desirable object, but also if it is behind an object which you can't pick up or can't use against any enemy within your reach. To complicate matters, many levels contain tiles which only allow movement in one direction, so that one can easily get stuck and must forfeit. Luckily, the monsters are immobile, so that at least timing is not a variable in the quest for the Sangraal. To aid you in your quest, you are given a password every five levels. This adaptation was made for the MSXdev '05 coding contest.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "2005", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Karoshi", "publishers": "MSXdev", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IU6sAd022P4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/88984-griels-quest-for-the-sangraal\n"}
