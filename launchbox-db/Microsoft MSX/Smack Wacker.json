{"altername_name": [], "name": "Smack Wacker", "overview": "Smack Wacker puts you into the role of a pair of false teeth, stuck in a maze filled with fluour pills, and nasty mouth bacteria. So this is a Pac-Man-like maze gobbler. Unlike the intricate mazes and smart ghosts of Pac-Man, Smack Wacker is very mechanical. The maze is made up of smaller and smaller squares inside each other, thereby forming corridors. The openings between the corridors move around the edges of the boxes, and the mouth bacteria move singlemindedly around and around in their respective corridors. You tell the false teeth to move clockwise or counter-clockwise in a corridor, or to stop and wait for the opening to the adjacent corridor to pass by. Colliding with the mouth bacteria, which mirror your own movement, doesn't instantly kill you, since you have a power bar.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "The Bytebusters", "publishers": "Compulogical, S.A.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/105434-smack-wacker\n"}
