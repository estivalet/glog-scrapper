{"altername_name": [], "name": "Lords of Time", "overview": "Doctor Who references are obvious in this text adventure - you play a time travelling hero, who faces a group of Time Lords as they attempt to rewrite human history. To do this, you must collect nine objects which have an hourglass symbol on, from nine different time zones. You will encounter tigers and an Ice Queen in the Ice Age, a guard and a frog in the middle ages, a Cyberman in the future, and more mundane tasks in the present day. To enter different time zones, go into the grandfather clock in your home (the starting location) and activate one of the nine cogs. Lords of Time is played by typing commands to guide your character, moving in compass directions and with standard commands such as OPEN DOOR, GET GLASS and EXAMINE CAR. Objects you will encounter include keys, an emerald and a petrol can. This game was the first of the Time and Magik Trilogy, the other two being Red Moon and The Price of Magik.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Level 9 Computing", "publishers": "Level 9 Computing", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151277-lords-of-time\n"}
