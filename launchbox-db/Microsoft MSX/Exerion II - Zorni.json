{"altername_name": [], "name": "Exerion II: Zorni", "overview": "This is a shoot-em-up game is the sequel to Exerion again with parallax effects in the background. It does have a simulation of inertia in the control of the ship. There are dozens of enemies and two types of shooting: slow and fast. Two weapon systems: one slow double-shot cannon and one fast single-shot cannon. With each enemy hit by the slow cannon you get one shot added to the fast cannon ammunition supply. A challenge stage follows each stage in which you can build up your fast-shot bullet supply.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Jaleco", "publishers": "Toshiba", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "0.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8tAk9DvYOk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83168-exerion-ii-zorni\n"}
