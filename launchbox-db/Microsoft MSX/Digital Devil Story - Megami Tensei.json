{"altername_name": ["Digital Devil Monogatari: Megami Tensei", "Megamitensho"], "name": "Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei", "overview": "This version of Megami Tensei has little to do with the Famicom (NES) version (and with Megaten RPGs in general) gameplay-wise. It is an action game with RPG elements, in which you must fight your way through a series of mazes infested with demons, whom you must defeat in real time combat. You find many items and become stronger as the game progresses, but the emphasis of the game is not on character development but on action-oriented combat and exploration of the dungeons.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Telenet Japan", "publishers": "Telenet Japan", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/89236-digital-devil-story-megami-tensei\n"}
