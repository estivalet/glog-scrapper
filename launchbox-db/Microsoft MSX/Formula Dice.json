{"altername_name": [], "name": "Formula Dice", "overview": "Game presented in the MSXdev'08 contest. FORMULA DICE is a little game about the Formula 1. It is a managerial game in which you start on the Formula 3 and you have to reach and win the Formula 1. To do this you have to improve your team points; they are divided in driver and motor points. Why this division? Because in every round (like in real GP) they will be multiplied for a decimal factor to simulate fast GP where the motor is important and slow GP where counts the driver skill.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "2008", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "", "developers": "Robylu", "publishers": "MSXdev", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/145274-formula-dice\n"}
