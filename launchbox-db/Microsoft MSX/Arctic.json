{"altername_name": [], "name": "Arctic", "overview": "Arctic is an action puzzle game that describes itself as \"active rail playing\". Each of more than two-dozen stages consists of a set of rails in various arrangements, often looping around each other and splitting in various directions. Each stage contains a number of colored balls which begin in corresponding slots, and after launching them the goal is to return the balls to the matching-colored slots. The only interaction the player has with the board is switching two sets of splits; there are yellow and blue splits, which will redirect any balls moving through them, and the player can only turn all of one color as a group. Many stages also contain bumpers and gates which will affect the speed and direction of the balls. Completing a puzzle often requires strategic use of the stage's features to bounce balls onto the correct paths.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "January 1, 1989", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Pony Canyon", "publishers": "Pony Canyon", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.6", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/33592-arctic\n"}
