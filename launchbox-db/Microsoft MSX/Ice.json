{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ice", "overview": "In Ice you control a penguin on a screen that's partly-filled with a pattern of ice-cubes. In among the ice-cubes are three diamonds, at least in the first level, though these increase in number as the game goes on. You need to gather all the diamonds together in one part of the screen to enable you to go through to the next level. You have also to keep away from the inevitable nasties that share the screen with you and plod relentlessly in your direction.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "The Bytebusters", "publishers": "Eaglesoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "0.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/88201-ice\n"}
