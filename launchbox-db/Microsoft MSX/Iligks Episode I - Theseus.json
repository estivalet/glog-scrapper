The labyrinth is oriented vertically, and must be traversed by running and jumping. Theseus can jump any distance vertically while holding down the jump button, and can maneuver in mid-air. Obstacles within the maze include lava and invulnerable creatures whose touch reduce the players vitality. There is also a time-limit for completion of the level.
