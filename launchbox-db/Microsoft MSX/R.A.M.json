When the game begins Fox has landed far away from his objective and he needs to cross several areas packed with enemy soldiers. At first, Fox has to rely on his assault rifle and his hand grenades, but later on he can use stationary guns and even vehicles. The vehicles need fuel, and their clever use is essential in succeeding.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Topo Soft", "publishers": "Topo Soft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/R.A.M._(videojuego)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/88216-ram\n"}
