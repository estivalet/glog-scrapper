{"altername_name": [], "name": "10th Frame", "overview": "Leader Board authors Bruce and Roger Carver tried their hand at tenpin bowling, in one of the game's earliest recreations. The process of bowling the ball involves timing a succession of clicks to set the right angle, speed and curve, similarly to Leaderboard's system. Three skill levels are provided - Kids level sets the speed and hook automatically, while Amateur has more margin for error with hook/slice than professional. The game is played from a plan view, with four other (empty) lanes visible. Single matches or a league structure can be played.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Paragon Programming", "publishers": "Erbe Software", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "8", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.8", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10th_Frame", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UReE5_5uJv8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/41433-10th-frame\n"}
