{"altername_name": [], "name": "Vaxol: Heavy Armed Storm Vehicle", "overview": "Vaxol is best described as a Space Harrier look-alike. You are a heavily armed robot, seen from behind running across a planet surface. Since the surface is filled with dangers in the form of rock formations and other obstacles, you can fly all over the screen as well. Waves of enemies come from afar, many of them very similar to ones known from Space Harrier. As you reach the end of the level, there is of course a giant boss to defeat. You have four weapon systems at your disposal, which are unlocked one by one by picking up bonuses laying on the ground. You start out with only one life, which makes Vaxol's task even tougher.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Heart Soft", "publishers": "Heart Soft", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/131966-vaxol-heavy-armed-storm-vehicle\n"}
