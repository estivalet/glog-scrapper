{"altername_name": [], "name": "Lazer Bykes", "overview": "This is one of those Tron-style games where you and an opponent, either human or computer-controled, ride light cycles in an arena. This is very much like a \"snake\" game, but where the tail never ends, forcing you to go on as long as possible, trying to trap your opponent with your \"tail\". This particular version is played until either version has died ten times, has optional obstacles and two speeds.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "PSS", "publishers": "PSS (Personal Software Services)", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/103970-lazer-bykes\n"}
