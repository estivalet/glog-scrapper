{"altername_name": [], "name": "Space Maze Attack", "overview": "Space Maze Attack is a top-down shooter in which the player navigates a white spaceship in search of treasure through claustrophobic mazes that are infested with hostile aliens. The spacecraft is equipped with a simple peashooter and has limited energy. When the energy runs out, the spaceship explodes. Upon finding a treasure, the unused energy is converted to points and a new level starts. There is also a 2-player mode where two people can take turns in order to find out who can amass the highest score.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "HAL Laboratory", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/131426-space-maze-attack\n"}
