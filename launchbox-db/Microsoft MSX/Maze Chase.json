{"altername_name": [], "name": "Maze Chase", "overview": "MSX-BASIC game developed for Karoshi 2006 MSX-BASIC Game Contest. Your objective in the game is to escape from the mazes before your energy runs out and without being captured by the maze guardian : the deadly deep purple monster!, it will chase you in a few seconds after entering the maze!. There's no light inside it and the walls are electrified, your energy will be drained if you touch them. Seems an impossible task; but remember you can, using your chi-energy to generate a brief flash of light that could serve you to find the path to the exit. The Masters are watching you!.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "2006", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "", "developers": "JLTurSan", "publishers": "JLTurSan", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/152203-maze-chase\n"}
