{"altername_name": [], "name": "Amaurote", "overview": "The player controls an \"Arachnus 4\", an armoured fighting-machine that moves on four legs. The player must first select a sector to play in via a map screen and then control the Arachnus as it wanders an isometric view of the cityscape attacking marauding insects and searching for the insect queen using a scanner. The Arachnus attacks by launching bouncing bombs. It can only launch one at a time so if a bomb misses its intended target the player will have to wait until it hits the scenery or bounces against the fence of the play area before he can fire again. Once the queen has been located, the player can radio-in a \"supa-bomb\" which can be used to destroy the queen. The player can also radio-in other supplies such as additional bombs and even ask to be pulled out of the combat zone. Extra weaponry costs the player \"dosh\", the in-game currency.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Mastertronic", "publishers": "Mastertronic Added Dimension", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amaurote", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wseg1r5Vueg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/44849-amaurote\n"}
