{"altername_name": [], "name": "Fruity Frank", "overview": "You control Fruity Frank as he tries to harvest all of the fruits on the screen. However, there are numerous bad guys out to get him! Frank can defend himself from the bad guys in two ways: he can push the apples located throughout the play field on top of the enemies and crush them or Frank can use his power ball. This ball can be thrown at an enemy to destroy it. He has only one power ball, though, so he will need to wait for it to return to him before it can be used again. When you successfully collect all of the cherries, you will move on to the next and more challenging level. This game is very similar to the first Mr. Do! game except that in Fruity Frank you don't collect letters from the alphabet.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Steven Wallis", "publishers": "Kuma Computers", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruity_Frank", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6kDNuVSwg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/88859-fruity-frank\n"}
