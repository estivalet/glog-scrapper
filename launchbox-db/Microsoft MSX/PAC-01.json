{"altername_name": ["Pac 01"], "name": "PAC-01", "overview": "A certain round yellow guy, who\u2019s probably the most iconic video game character ever, makes his entrance in ARC8\u2019s recent MSX game called \u201cPAC-01\u201d. That\u2019s right, it is Pac-Man himself that makes waves in the world\u2019s fastest dot eating game. Combine Pac-Man with relentless vertical scrolling, and you get an interesting game concept. In PAC-01, your playfield scrolls from bottom to top, as pills are scattered around to be eaten. However, pills aren\u2019t the sole item on the menu. The point of PAC-01 is that you advance a level when you had all six of the the spooky baddies for lunch \u2013 or dinner, whatever you prefer. Also, as is only befitting in a Pac-Man themed game, pieces of fruit will appear occasionally to serve as a refreshing snack which will increase your score. In this fine piece of Z80 entertainment, you hunt down the ghosts that escaped from the glitch; the deadly green computer bits at the bottom of the screen. This pool of game glitches also means instant death to our yellow little protagonist. So, don\u2019t let those bits byte you! PAC-01 features a one and two player mode, as well as a \u201cFast Game\u201d mode. Whereas the objective in the 1P mode is to munch up all of the ghosts, in 2P mode the player with the most points wins when the game is over (which happens when the maze ends). As for the Fast Mode it means\u2026 well, just survive!", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "August 28, 2021", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "ARC8", "publishers": "MSXdev", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://www.msxdev.org/2021/08/31/msxdev21-30-pac-01/", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/6-gj6WRlhss", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/170148-pac-01\n"}
