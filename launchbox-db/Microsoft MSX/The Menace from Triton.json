{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Menace from Triton", "overview": "The Menace from Triton is a horizontal shooting game inspired in some of MSX classic shooters like Salamander or the Nemesis saga, but with elements of a few modern shooter games (in particular Steredenn and Z-Exemplar). The game combines arcade-style horizontal shooter action with the resource managing/shop mechanics of Z-Exemplar, and the procedural generation of Steredenn. The first levels start out quite easy, but the game gets harder and harder towards the end. So, make sure you upgrade your ship as much as possible, or it will be impossible to defeat Triton!", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "2020", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Brain Games", "publishers": "Matra", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/163386-the-menace-from-triton\n"}
