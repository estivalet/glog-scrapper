{"altername_name": [], "name": "Auf Wiedersehen Monty", "overview": "Auf Wiedersehen Monty (German for \"Goodbye Monty\") is a computer game for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, MSX and Commodore 16. Released in 1987, it is the fourth of the Monty series, following Monty is Innocent, Monty on the Run and the successful original Wanted: Monty Mole. It was written by Peter Harrap and Shaun Hollingworth with music by Rob Hubbard and Ben Daglish. The player controls Monty as he travels around Europe collecting money in order to buy a Greek island - Montos, where he can safely retire. Gameplay is in the style of a flick-screen platform game, similar to many such games of the 1980s such as Technician Ted and Jet Set Willy. Some screens (such as those representing the Eiffel Tower and the Pyrenees) bear some relation to their real-life counterparts but most are just typical platform game screens.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Peter Harrap", "publishers": "Gremlin Graphics Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.39", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auf_Wiedersehen_Monty", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYL1Tvl4qyQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/44930-auf-wiedersehen-monty\n"}
