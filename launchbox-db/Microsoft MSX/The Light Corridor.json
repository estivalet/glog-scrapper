{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Light Corridor", "overview": "The aim of the game is to guide a ball through 50 levels of walls, barriers and general obstacles. You control a bat, which must 'serve' the ball into play, and then follow it through the level, deflecting it before it falls behind you, as this costs you one of your 4 lives. Initially the obstacles are all static, but moving barriers add timing, reactions and luck to proceedings. There are also several bonus objects, which are collected by passing through them. These include an L for an extra ball and dual rectangles to give you a second bat which moves around at random. The game also comes with a full level editor, allowing you to design new levels and save them to tape or disk.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "New Frontier", "publishers": "Infogrames", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Light_Corridor", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/104011-the-light-corridor\n"}
