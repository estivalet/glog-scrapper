{"altername_name": [], "name": "Soviet", "overview": "Set during the collapse of the Soviet Union, this arcade style game puts the player in control of a Soviet tank. This tank must explore the areas of Vilnius and Baku and rescue all Russian citizens. Meanwhile, the rebel armies will attack with everything they have. The game uses an overhead view of the battlefield and multi-directional scroll. The gameplay is reminiscent of games like SWIV, but the need to rescue a certain number of hostages to complete the level adds a limited strategy element: the goal of the game is not to defeat the enemies, a task literally impossible as they re-spawn within seconds, but to rescue the hostages before being blown up.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Opera Soft", "publishers": "Opera Soft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/105483-soviet\n"}
