You can hold down the fire button for a burst of Charged fire, which is especially essential to defeat the bosses. The player can hold down the Jump button to transform back and forth between a Mobile Robot or an Aero Fighter. Some sections have confrontations on both ground and air; others insist on aerial battling. Your time in the Aero Fighter is limited by its fuel requirement.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Jaleco", "publishers": "Eaglesoft", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_Z", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAYyxu7rq1k", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/82954-formation-z\n"}
