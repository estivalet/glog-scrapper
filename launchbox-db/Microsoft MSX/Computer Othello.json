{"altername_name": [], "name": "Computer Othello", "overview": "Computer Othello is an implementation of the classic two-player board game. The board is an 8x8 square on which white and black tokens are placed. The starting position has two tokens of each colour diagonally opposite in the central 2x2 square. Black then places a token so that there is now one or more lines (of one or more consecutive white tokens) between the placed token and another black token. These lines can be either horizontally, vertically or diagonally, and results in all of those tokens being flipped to black. The same rule applies when white plays to flip black tokens. Players alternate placing single tokens at a time, and must flip a token each turn. Only if no legal move is available can they pass. The aim is to have the most tokens of your colour before both players need to pass. This version of othello allows play against the computer, with up to four skill levels. There is also a view button for beginners to show what squares allow legal token placement.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sony Corporation", "publishers": "Sony Corporation", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4pN9KbYumk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/82930-computer-othello\n"}
