{"altername_name": ["Zexas"], "name": "Z.E.X.A.S", "overview": "Z.E.X.A.S (also spelled Zexas) is a fixed screen shoot 'em up game with pseudo three dimensional graphics. Similar to Gyruss the enemies appear far off in the centre of the screen and move towards the player but in this game movement is restricted to the lower part of the screen where the player ship can move left and right as well as up and down. When shooting, the bullets don't travel vertically but towards the centre of the screen. The game also features levels taking place in tunnels where the player not only has to fight the enemies but also avoid crashing into the walls. These work differently in the various versions. Whereas the tunnels in the X1 version are similar to trenches (like in Buck Rogers: Planet of Zoom) the MSX version has tunnels made out of simple squares.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "dB-SOFT", "publishers": "dB-Soft", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt9CdQcWw_o", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/105364-zexas\n"}
