{"altername_name": ["Flappy Limited 85"], "name": "Flappy Limited '85", "overview": "Flappy (\u30d5\u30e9\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc, Furapp\u012b) is a puzzle game by dB-Soft in the same vein as the Eggerland series and Sokoban that is obscure outside Japan. It features Flappy, a somewhat mole-like character who must complete each level by pushing a blue stone from its starting place to the blue tile destination. Flappy first appeared on the Sharp X1 home computer in 1983. This debut was soon followed by conversions to a number of popular Japanese computers in the early 1980s, including the NEC's line of PCs and the Fujitsu FM series. Ports for the MSX computer line and the Family Computer were released in 1985. dB-Soft produced a sequel with more difficult puzzles called King Flappy for the benefit of anyone who managed to clear the original 200 levels (or \"sides\" as the game calls them). A Nintendo Game Boy port was released exclusively in Japan in 1990 and was published by Victor Musical Industries.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "dB-SOFT", "publishers": "dB-Soft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdS2dKW1Tnw&ab_channel=FunCade64", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/82952-flappy-limited-85\n"}
