{"altername_name": [], "name": "Knuckle Joe", "overview": "From http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/korea/part1/company-prosoft.htm: This is the only existing home version of the arcade game Knuckle Joe, but it isn't anything like the original game and pretty terrible. Its controls are even worse than the arcade game, and the game was changed to a single screen action platformer, more like a clone of Jackie Chan in The Protector or Legend of Takeru. The cover art was stolen from the NES game Dr. Chaos.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Prosoft", "publishers": "Prosoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151914-knuckle-joe\n"}
