{"altername_name": [], "name": "GRAVITICA", "overview": "The concept of the game is quite simple. The view is 2D Nemesis-like, but you can not shoot. Instead, what you are going to do is to generate gravity around yourself. By generating gravity, you can distort the field around yourself, so that, you can get through the enemy's laser which blocks your way. But also, by generating gravity, enemy's bullets will gather around you.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "2018", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "", "developers": "Yusuke Miyauchi", "publishers": "MSXdev", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/145271-gravitica\n"}
