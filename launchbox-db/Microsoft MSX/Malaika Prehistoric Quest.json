{"altername_name": [], "name": "Malaika Prehistoric Quest", "overview": "One day, a young cave princess called Malaika comes back from a visit to her relatives, only to find that all inhabitants of her village are gone. The villagers have been turned into energy crystals by aliens from the future, who plan to use Malaika's fellows as fuel for their machines. Malaika sets out to rescue her friends and put a stop to the aliens' plans. You control Malaika in a basic platform game, playing like a cross between Super Mario Bros and the original Wonder Boy, but without any offensive weapons. The mainstay of the enemies are coloured blobs, most of which disappear when you jump on them. The purple blobs are more dangerous, since they can electrocute Malaika if she jumps on them at the wrong time. Other enemies are flying blobs and Super Mario-style cannons.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "2006", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Karoshi", "publishers": "Matra", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151941-malaika-prehistoric-quest\n"}
