{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bit Byter", "overview": "For Bit Byter, the only pleasure in life is to bite a bit of this and a bit of that. He is always desperate to find something to bite, so, most of the time, he is in a great hurry. That is the reason why very often he crashes into the wall and dies. Worst still, he uses up energy very quickly while he is looking for a bit to bite. Once his energy runs out, he can no longer bite anything at all. To add excitement to his adventure, three SV-monsters keep chasing Bit Byter from the third level onwards.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Spectravideo", "publishers": "Spectravideo", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/53521-bit-byter\n"}
