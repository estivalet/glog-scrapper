{"altername_name": [], "name": "Panique", "overview": "A clone of Universal's classic Space Panic, this game has you scaling platforms on which evil space aliens roam. Armed only with a pickaxe, you must outsmart the aliens and dig holes for them to fall into. Those which fall into the holes must then be pushed through it with the pickaxe. After all the aliens are eliminated, you go on to the next level, but you must do so before your oxygen supply runs out. Panique has many level variations, interspersed by small animated intermissions. On later levels, the aliens become stronger, requiring several procedures with the pickaxe before being eliminated. The smartness of the enemies can be set when starting the game.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "The Bytebusters", "publishers": "Eaglesoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/105187-panique\n"}
