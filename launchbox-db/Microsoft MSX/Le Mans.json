The game uses the usual \"striped grass\" effect to simulate speed. Push up on the joystick to accelerate, but don't drive too fast in the curves, or you will drive off the road and the car will flip over.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Electric Software", "publishers": "Electric Software", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/93202-le-mans\n"}
