{"altername_name": [], "name": "The 4 Masters of Melody", "overview": "In The 4 Masters of Melody, you play Mirkell, a talented bard who is lost in the legendary and scary Melody Forest. Only by luck, four entities known as the 4 Masters of Melody find you. The vast, powerful ghost-looking guardians decide to help Mirkell to leave the forest, but with one condition: he has to repeat the twenty melodies that they will play, proving that you are a brave and brilliant minstrel. If Mirkell fails, however, the masters will discharge all their fury on him! The 4 Masters of Melody is a game for the MSX1 that works similarly to the game Simon, but in a fantasy setting. The objective is to match the sequence of musical notes played by the four masters. If you get a single note wrong, it is game over!", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "2019", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Clube MSX", "publishers": "Clube MSX", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/64FvEiPDTMs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/123331-the-4-masters-of-melody\n"}
