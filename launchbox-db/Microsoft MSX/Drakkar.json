{"altername_name": [], "name": "Drakkar", "overview": "Erik is the last of a generation of brave Viking warriors. Now is the time to prove the reason for his existence: become the king of his people. To do this, he must maintain a tough fight against his gods, who force him to carry out his mission in a very limited time. Erik will travel on the \"Drakkar\" through time, and will return to Roman times where his adventures will take place. Drakkar follows the scheme of a classic video-adventure with collection of objects and many screens, and contains skill elements in which the slightest mistake or jump out of time will make you lose a large amount of energy.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Diabolic Software", "publishers": "Delta Software S.L.", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/143558-drakkar\n"}
