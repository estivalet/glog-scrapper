{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mayhem", "overview": "An alien planet is dying and the little Tribbles are the only creatures still living, but only just. They too will die out if they aren't rescued from the planet. Luckily for the Tribbles, help is at hand in the form of you and your nifty spaceship. Mr. Micro has divided the game into three parts, in the first section all the tiny creatures must be lifted off the planet. In the second part you must save the creatures from being incinerated. In the final game stage you have to drop off on them in another planet. Only then will the species survive.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Mr. Micro", "publishers": "Mr. Micro", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138917-mayhem\n"}
