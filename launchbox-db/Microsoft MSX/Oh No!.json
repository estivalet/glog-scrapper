{"altername_name": ["Oh Shit!", "Shit!"], "name": "Oh No!", "overview": "This game is a Pac-Man clone for the MSX platform featuring graphics, sound, levels, ghosts and bonus fruits exactly as the real Pac-Man. Gameplay is familiar -- gobble dots for points, dodge ghosts (unless you have recently grabbed one of the special dots that allows you to eat them) and catch fruit for bonus points. The game encourages improvement and competition by storing high scores. The main difference is that this Pac-Man clone contains digitized speech. If a monster catches you then the computer screams 'Oh Shit!'. A non-offensive version of this game was released under the name Oh No!.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Aackosoft", "publishers": "Aackosoft International B.V.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.75", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh_Shit!", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Nlcrh4reWc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/105098-oh-no\n"}
