{"altername_name": ["Wingman"], "name": "Wing Man", "overview": "Kenta is a Japanese teenager who is obsessed with superhero stories. One day, he meets a mysterious girl named Aoi. She tells him she is from a dimension called Powdream, and gives him a powerful item called Dream Note, which can fulfill wishes. Kenta is eager to realize his dreams by asking to be transformed into a superhero named Wing Man. However, the dictator Rimel fears that the new hero will endanger his existence in Powdream, and swears to get rid of Kenta by separating him from Aoi. Based on the manga by Masakazu Katsura, Wing Man is an adventure game that combines text input with menu-based interaction. The player can directly input text commands, combining verb with objects. However, some commands (including location designations) are mapped to function keys. It is also possible to move the cursor on the screen to select objects. Beside the bulk of adventure gameplay, the game also features a few fighting sequences.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "TamTam", "publishers": "Enix", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/168773-wing-man\n"}
