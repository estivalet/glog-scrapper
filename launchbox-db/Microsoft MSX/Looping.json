{"altername_name": [], "name": "Looping", "overview": "Port from the Colecovision version. In Looping, a single player flies his/her airplane into Adventure-Land, battling hot air balloons, rockets, and other high-flying objects in the quest to reach \u201cThe End.\u201d An acceleration button, fire button, and a 2-dimensional (up-down) joystick are all you have as you fly your plane over cities, through pipes, and eventually into \u201cThe End\u201d itself. Death-defying looping maneuvers can be executed with ease as you attempt to destroy strange flying obstacles and ground targets.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "2013", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "", "developers": "GDX", "publishers": "GDX", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151276-looping\n"}
