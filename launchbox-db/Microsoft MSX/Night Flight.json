{"altername_name": [], "name": "Night Flight", "overview": "In Night Flight, you fly an airplane above a city, leaving a trace of dots behind. If the trace forms a rectangle, it is filled in. What makes this difficult is the fact that you are chased by a bolt of lightning (let out by the thunder god, no less). From time to time, a shooting star also crosses the screen. If you manage to trap the bolt of lightning within your line, the level is cleared. Much like in Qix, though, if the lightning or the star hits your line while it is being drawn, you lose a plane. However, lives are not lost just because a plane is hit. In an intermission, a plane flown by a comrade crosses the screen while you fall in a parachute, and with some luck or skill, you may guide the plane to pick up the falling pilot so that you are given a new chance.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Tomy Company", "publishers": "Colpax", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/105086-night-flight\n"}
