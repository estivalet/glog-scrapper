{"altername_name": [], "name": "Grid Wars", "overview": "In a galaxy far, far away, scientists discovered a new planet called Zilok-eti. The planet was unusual, for it was covered with strong grid-like energy fields. As your ship touched down on the planet surface, you discovered also different kinds of energon cubes, that could help you to escape from the forces of the grid. Unfortunately cybernetic war machines guard the energy cubes, and will try to blast you into smithereens. And so the grid wars begin!", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "2006", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "", "developers": "Emma Six", "publishers": "MSXdev", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147455-grid-wars\n"}
