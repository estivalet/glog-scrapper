{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mr. Chin", "overview": "Mr. Chin is a Chinese circus performer who specializes in balancing spinning plates on poles. Each stage consists of three levels with seven poles on each level, and Mr. Chin must demonstrate his acrobatic skills by spinning dishes on all of the poles at once. An unappreciative critic tries to thwart Mr.Chin by throwing cutlery at him from off-stage which he must avoid by either jumping or ducking. The frequency at which these objects are thrown increases for later stages. From stage 4, gaps in the floor appear and move about which will cause the circus star to fall. From stage 10, the levels wrap back to the beginning. To set a dish spinning, Mr. Chin must first collect a dish from the side of the screen which he carries this on his head. He then climbs an empty pole, and once at the top the dish is placed and spun. Each dish will only spin for a limited time before it starts to wobble more and more wildly before eventually falling. These dishes can be re-spun by climbing to the top of the pole again. A broken dish is a calamity for the perfectionist Mr. Chin, but he gamely continues his performances, although three mishaps are enough to ruin his career.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "HAL Laboratory", "publishers": "HAL Laboratory", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/104571-mr-chin\n"}
