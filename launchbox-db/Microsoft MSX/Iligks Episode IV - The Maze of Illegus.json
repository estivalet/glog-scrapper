{"altername_name": [], "name": "Iligks Episode IV: The Maze of Illegus", "overview": "Al-Mazar, a mysterious, inhospitable planet, is covered by a vast network of mazes. You have drawn the short straw and find yourself in the first maze, with no food, water or light. Somehow you have to escape from not one but 10 mazes. In full daylight the labyrinths are all coloured green and yellow. Your path through the maze is briIIiantly portrayed on screen as if you were actually standing inside one of the labyrinth corridors, the maze walls looming up on either side. Various shades of green help to give each labyrinth a three-dimensional look. Various objects, both dangerous and useful, lie around the maze, although the graphics are so indistinct it is hard to distinguish what is what. Food and water will increase your energy. Maze guardians or robots annihilate you on sight unless you get them with a laser gun first. Falling into dark pits also results in instant death. Infra-red viewer spectacles are essential for night time viewing as when the red sun sets, the maze turns dark blue and black making it virtually impossible to see. Heading for the sun, symbolised by a red cross, is the best plan. Mapping out the labyrinths on paper is quite diffi-cult, so you need a good sense of space and direction.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "ASCII", "publishers": "ASCII", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/103815-iligks-episode-iv-the-maze-of-illegus\n"}
