Despite what the name may infer, this compilation actually contains 92 games. The discrepancy is because various games are listed more then once, but starting at a higher level and/or with extra lives. Move left or right off the screen to flip to the next screen. Unfortunately there is no screen number indicator, making it difficult to navigate for non-Korean speakers. In addition the patching of The Goonies seems to have gone wrong, and instead of starting you at more advanced levels, your vitality is reduced. The numbering of the King's Valley levels in the menus is also not correct (off by one). * Screen 1 01. Tank Batallion 02. Super Cobra 03. Video Hustler 04. Bomber Man 05. Galaga 06.
