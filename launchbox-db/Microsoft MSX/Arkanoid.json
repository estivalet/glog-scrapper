{"altername_name": [], "name": "Arkanoid", "overview": "Arkanoid is an arcade game developed by Taito in 1986. It expanded upon Atari's Breakout games of the 1970s by adding power-ups, different types of bricks, a variety of level layouts, and visual layering and depth. The title refers to a doomed \"mothership\" from which the player's ship, the Vaus, escapes. The player controls the \"Vaus\", a space vessel that acts as the game's \"paddle\" which prevents a ball from falling from the playing field, attempting to bounce it against a number of bricks", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Taito", "publishers": "Erbe Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.92", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkanoid", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEHUdEDBNi4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/44922-arkanoid\n"}
