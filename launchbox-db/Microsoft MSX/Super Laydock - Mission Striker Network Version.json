{"altername_name": [], "name": "Super Laydock: Mission Striker Network Version", "overview": "A shoot 'em up game in the Laydock series that fits in perfectly between Laydock (Laydock 1) and Laydock 2. It's again a game that can be played by two players though a single player game is also a possibility. If played by two players they can cooperate by docking the jets together, docked side-by-side or end-to-end for greater fire and fighting power. When docked one player is the pilot and the other is the weapons officer.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "July 18, 1987", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "T&E Soft", "publishers": "T&E Soft", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27249-super-laydock-mission-striker-network-version\n"}
