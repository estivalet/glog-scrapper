{"altername_name": ["Jumpin' Jack"], "name": "Jumpin Jack", "overview": "A Frogger clone from Livewire Software. As usual, your goal is to safely guide the frog across the road, avoiding the cars, jumping on the turtles and tree trunks across the river and land safely in one of the five slots on the other shore. The C64 and MSX versions add a pseudo-isometric effect to the graphics, as well as a female frog and an insect to be eaten for bonus points. After all five slots are filled up, the gameplay repeats, but faster.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "LiveWire Software", "publishers": "LiveWire Software UK", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/103896-jumpin-jack\n"}
