{"altername_name": [], "name": "Draconic Throne", "overview": "In this game we play the role of the dragon for once, instead of the brave soldier. Sounds like a refreshing role reversal, doesn\u2019t it? With the dragon\u2019s devastating firepower under our control, we\u2019ll eliminate all of the enemies in order to defeat the prince that awaits at the end of each level. Once we defeat the prince, we\u2019ll enter a new age with more enemies, which are different and more difficult to beat each time. Don\u2019t leave any of those puny humans alive. Burn \u2019em all!
