{"altername_name": [], "name": "Zona 0", "overview": "A directly TRON-inspired (though unlicensed) variety of the snake game, Zona 0 puts the player in control of a \"light cycle\" that zooms across an enclosed grid with other bikes, each leaving impassable lines in their wake. As the play field gets cluttered up with these trails, it gets more and more difficult to avoid accidentally driving in to one, veering sharply with 90-degree turns. The player's goal is to outlast the computer-operated light bikes, proceeding to the next level.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Topo Soft", "publishers": "Erbe Software", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/139003-zona-0\n"}
