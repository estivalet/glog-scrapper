{"altername_name": [], "name": "Highway Encounter", "overview": "In this isometric 3D action-strategy game, the player uses a Vorton droid to push a bomb to the end of the highway into an alien base. There are 30 screens, most of them filled with hazards trying to block (like barrels) or destroy (mines and aliens) your bomb. The perspective and guidance concept are not the game's only original features; there are 4 more Vorton droids with you, representing your extra lives - pushing you forward on your mission. If these other Vortons are destroyed, one of your extra lives is lost without the player being able to use it.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Vortex Software", "publishers": "Vortex Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highway_Encounter", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slPr2QJSEc4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/89356-highway-encounter\n"}
