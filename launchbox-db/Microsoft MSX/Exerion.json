{"altername_name": [], "name": "Exerion", "overview": "This is a shoot-em-up game with parallax effects in the background. It does have a simulation of inertia in the control of the ship. There are dozens of enemies and two types of shooting: slow and fast. Two weapon systems: one slow double-shot cannon and one fast single-shot cannon. With each enemy hit by the slow cannon you get one shot added to the fast cannon ammunition supply. A challenge stage follows each stage in which you can build up your fast-shot bullet supply.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Jaleco", "publishers": "Dempa Micomsoft Co., LTD", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.83", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exerion", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoONMOI5TZM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/82946-exerion\n"}
