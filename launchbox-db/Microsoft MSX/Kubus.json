{"altername_name": [], "name": "Kubus", "overview": "Kubus is a basic vertical scrolling arcade game in which you, as an astronaut, have to collect the purple dots in a maze-like and cube shaped floor while avoiding enemy objects. Occasionally special objects appear which contain special powers, such as no enemies for a certain amount of time or invulnerability. When all purple dots have been collected you can jump to the next level which are separated by a wide and cube less gap. This gap contains only some cubes if all dots have been collected and those cubes can be used as a bridge to jump to the next level. You have only a limited amount of oxygen to collect all the dots and if you fail you'll loose a life. It's only possible to move and jump diagonal. The game can be played at two different difficulty levels.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Simon K.
