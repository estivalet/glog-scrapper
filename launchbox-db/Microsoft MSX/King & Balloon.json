{"altername_name": [], "name": "King & Balloon", "overview": "King & Balloon (\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0 & \u30d0\u30eb\u30fc\u30f3, Kingu & Bar\u016bn) is a fixed shooter arcade game which was released by Namco in 1980, and licensed to GamePlan for U.S. manufacture and distribution. It runs upon the Namco Galaxian hardware, based on the Z80 microprocessor, with an extra Zilog Z80 microprocessor to drive a DAC for speech; it was one of the first games to have speech synthesis. The King speaks when he is captured (\"HELP!\"), when he is rescued (\"THANK YOU\"), and when he is carried away (\"BYE BYE!\"). The balloons also make the same \"droning\" sound as the aliens from Galaxian, released in the previous year, and the cannon's shots also make the same sound as those of the player's ship (the \"Galaxip\") from the very same game.", "platform": "Microsoft MSX", "release_date": "June 1, 1980", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Namco", "publishers": "Namco", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_%26_Balloon", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83025-king-balloon\n"}
