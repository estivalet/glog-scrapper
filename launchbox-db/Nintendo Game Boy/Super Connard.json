{"name": "Super Connard", "overview": "Super Connard sounds like an innocent name for a game doesn't it? That is until you translate it from French and discover that actually means 'Super Asshole'. A collection of three mini-games that sees you playing none other than Joseph \"I stuff monkeys into Pringle tubes in the name of science\" Herring, Kim Jong-un and Adolf Hitler, it could be the most controversial game to ever hit a Nintendo console. Super Connard comprises of three simple, almost-LCD style mini-games, featuring CEO Joseph Herring's drive to work (running over as many animals as possible whilst avoiding concrete blocks), Adolf Hitler distributing trains full of 'resources' to appropriate camps and Kim Jong-un preventing food aid from reaching the North Korean populace. Each challenge is preceded by a short story introducing the respective player character (currently in French, although an English ROM will be available soon), with the overall goal of achieving the status of 'Super Asshole' via online high score board supremacy.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "2013", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "", "developers": "Furrtek Software Engineering", "publishers": "Furrtek Software Engineering", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/129865\n"}
