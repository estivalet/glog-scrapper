{"name": "Qix", "overview": "QIX - it's sneaky, it's snakey, it's an unpredictable energy field! It rotates, stretches, shortens and changes directions in a flash. QIX tries to catch your diamond cursor before you complete a box. Once the box is complete you've taken over that part of the screen. But watch the moving sparks. If they catch you, it'll be over in an instant. When you claim 75% or more of the screen, you win the round. Each level is more difficult, with more sparks to dodge and two QIX's to challenge you!", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "May 1, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Minakuchi Engineering", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.63", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qix", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21071\n"}
