{"name": "Ultra Golf", "overview": "Ultra Golf is a golf game with two courses which can be either played in training or tournament mode. After inspecting the field from an overhead view, the shot is performed from a separate window. First the player gets to choose the direction and club and then the classic \"two click\" system comes into play: a symbol moves on a circle and its position after pressing the button influences the drift and strength of the shot. It is important to consider the wind direction.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "November 1, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21163\n"}
