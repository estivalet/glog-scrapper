{"name": "PGA European Tour", "overview": "This game lets players compete on the PGA European Tour. It features the Forest of Arden, Wentworth, Crans Sur Sierre, and Valderrama golf courses. Players can either choose to practice a round, play in a tournament, or compete in a skins challenge. Before players head out to the links they can choose whether to use a standard, match, skill, or power set of clubs and whether to use an amateur or professional tee. At each hole, players are given an overhead view of the course. Here they are given a draw/fade meter which effects how the ball is hit. After that is selected, a view of the golfer is shown with a power meter that ranges from 0 to 100%. The amount of power and the club used will effect the distance the golf swing will have on the ball.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "January 1, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Capcom", "publishers": "Capcom", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/23436\n"}
