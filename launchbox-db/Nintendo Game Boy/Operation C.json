{"name": "Operation C", "overview": "YOU'RE UP AGAINST A COLD BLOODED SNAKE OF AN ENEMY. Red Falcon had devoured a portion of this planet and now the vile Black Viper has come from deep space for seconds. But he hasn't come alone. Viper's transported a battalion of battletron tanks, stealth subs, laser cannons, and annihilating androids. And he's seized a secret naval lab to develop a new breed of supreme alien being. So Scorpion stands alone against biological experiments gone bad like towering tarantulas and venomous vesty flies. His mission: level the lab before Viper transforms earth into an alien nation. Although he may be a solo commando, Scorpion has an array of devastating weapons at his disposal like a M-90 Shell Shocker, Fire Phazer and Homing Blaster. But it will take more than sheer firepower to survive five new lethal levels of naval ports, forests, caverns and a laboratory filled with genetic mutants. You've got a snowball's chance in Haiti of making it. But that's the way Scorpion likes it!", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "January 8, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Ultra Games", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.33", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_C_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/17222\n"}
