{"name": "Maui Mallard in Cold Shadow", "overview": "When he morphs into a ninja, you better duck! Play as Maui. Play as the Ninja. Play as Maui. Play as the Ninja. Try not to get dizzy. Find the missing Shabuhm Shabuhm idol before your island paradise goes kaboom kaboom! 40 hours of intense gameplay. So pack plenty of attitude. And your bug gun. Come beak to beak with MudDrakes, Rotting Pirates, Duck Zombies, Amazon Warriors. And a bunch of fowl-tempered hangers-on. Laugh in the face of danger from the top of a volcano, the bottom of the sea, the Realm of the Dead, and Ninja Training Grounds. Then get the heck out! Live every level like it's your last - 'cuz it may be!", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "August 1, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Bonsai Entertainment", "publishers": "Sunsoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.46", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/20997\n"}
