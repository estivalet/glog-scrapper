{"name": "Lethal Weapon", "overview": "This version of Lethal Weapon has an emphasis on beating the bad guys with the fists, although Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh also have their pistols. There are several pick ups that can be used as weapons: knives, grenades and crates. The player controls Riggs from the start of the game; however, if the player takes Riggs out of the left side of the screen, he\u2019ll swap him for Murtaugh. While out of the screen, the other character gains back some health, so alternating characters is essential to survive. Characters have different stats and abilities: Riggs jumps higher and can pick up knives and his attack is a high kick. Murtaugh is not as agile, but he can pick up crates and attacks with a punch. On later levels enemies drain the characters\u2019 health bar very quickly and once both cops are dead you can use a continue only once. The game is divided into 3 levels each 3 stages long. The GameBoy version, however, consists only of the two later levels.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "April 1, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Eurocom Entertainment Software", "publishers": "Ocean Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.23", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lethal_Weapon_(video_game)#NES_and_Game_Boy_version", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21027\n"}
