{"name": "Castlevania II: Belmont's Revenge", "overview": "AN ADVENTURE YOU CAN REALLY SINK YOUR TEETH INTO. Fifteen years after vanquishing the emperor of evil, Count Dracula, Christopher Belmont now faces a vampire swearing vengeance. Drac\u2019s back. And he\u2019s turned your son, Soleiyu Belmont, into a deadly demon to do his dirty deeds. Now not only do you have to rescue your kid from the Count\u2019s clutches, you have to first track him down in four creep packed castles. And they all contain vile visions of horror. Slimy river serpents and acid spewing snake heads lurk in the Crystal Castle. Angel Mummy and his clan of catastrophic creatures like carnivorous swamp toads and life like sucking Wolf Spiders dwell in the Plant Castle. The dark corridors of the Cloud Castle hold evil knights, venomous jellyfish and Kumulo & Nimbler, two monstrous stone demons who rule their kingdom with a granite fist. And forces of the undead walk the Stone Castle\u2019s halls including zombies, mobile brain matter and the Iron Doll, an armor plated warrior from the underworld. Fortunately, you possess weapons like armor piercing Battle Axes, beast burning Holy Water, and the Legendary Mystic Whip. And you can increase your arsenal with power up items like Crystal Balls, Hearts and Candles. Strap on your shield and step into the shadows. That is, if you\u2019re prepared for the dwellers of darkness.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "July 12, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.11", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castlevania_II:_Belmont's_Revenge", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqQNp6vwaJE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/3007\n"}
