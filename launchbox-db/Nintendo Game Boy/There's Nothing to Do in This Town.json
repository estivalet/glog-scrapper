{"name": "There's Nothing to Do in This Town", "overview": "There's Nothing To Do In This Town is a short RPG for the original Nintendo Game Boy set in a dystopian present featuring music snobs, zombies, and alcoholic parents. Available either as a Game Boy ROM for you to download to play on an emulator or flash cartridge, or here in your browser as an HTML5 game. Works pretty well in most phone browsers too. You can play it through in under an hour. Inspired by my crushing depression and written during the 2020 lockdown (but before the 2020 zombie apocalypse). Written by, and including two original chiptune pieces by donotrunwithpixels, aka Simeon Smith.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "May 30, 2020", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "donotrunwithpixels", "publishers": "donotrunwithpixels", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/157207\n"}
