{"name": "Dennis the Menace", "overview": "Here comes trouble! Yipes! Grab your slingshot, water pistol and peashooter. Mr. Wilton's valuable coin collection has been stolen! Dennis was only trying to help - he didn't mean to ruin Mr. Wilson's garden club party. But when Dennis is around, one thing always seems to go wrong: EVERYTHING! Now his only chance to win back Mr. Wilson's friendship is to go after that thieving thug, Switchblade Sam. If he can get out of Mr. Wilson's house, Dennis will have to brave the weird woods, the spooky sewers, the adventure park, and the crazed coach in the school gym before he even gets a shot at Sam. In this late-night escapade, everyone he meets will be a menace to Dennis! Recovering the coin collection and bringing Switchblade Sam to justice will be an adventure more harrowing than a garden full of cheek-pinchers - but if Dennis can't do it, then nobody can, fer gosh sakes!", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "December 31, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Citizen Software", "publishers": "Ocean of America, Inc.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.83", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_the_Menace_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rb48SmInV4c", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/18042\n"}
