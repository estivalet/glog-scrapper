{"name": "Faceball 2000", "overview": "Welcome to the exciting new world of Faceball 2000, where 3D graphics, first person perspective and 360-degree maneuverability put you and up to three friends (or foes!) inside your Game Boy. What you see is where you are, as you team up, compete with each other or play alone against computer-controlled opponents. Transport yourself inside the walls of CyberScape, a series of more than 70 treacherous mazes filled with tricks, traps and menacing enemies. Or, enter the Arena where \"Have a Nice Day\" takes on a whole new meaning in fast-paced rounds of high-tech combat. Wherever you go in Faceball 2000, it's your chance to wipe the smiles off those annoying happy faces - and maybe a few of your friends - once and for all!", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "December 1, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Xanth Software F/X", "publishers": "Bullet-Proof Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.17", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI_Maze", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQAhnNiOu54", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/3021\n"}
