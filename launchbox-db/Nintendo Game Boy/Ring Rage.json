{"name": "Ring Rage", "overview": "Ring Rage is a standard wrestling game, just without the glitz and glamour of licensed games. There are six wrestlers total, but only five are playable: Gunboat Rody, a former Navy sailor Spike, a giant of a man from the means streets of New York Yasha, a masked Japanese wrestler Shadam, a Middle Eastern grappler KO Joe, a former boxer now trying his hand at professional wrestling. Killer Cane, an unknown wrestler from Canada is faced in the championship bout of the tournament, but he is not a playable character. There are only three modes, 1P v. CPU, 1P v. 2P (which is achieved through a cable link and an extra cartridge) and a tournament which you compete to go for the TWF (Taito Wrestling Federation) championship.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Taito", "publishers": "Natsume", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21077\n"}
