It is loosely based on the 1991 Formula One season. The gameplay is very similar to the Game Boy's F-1 Race and Nakajima Satoru F-1 Hero, however the degree of difficulty is higher. The track map is not displayed on the screen, which means the player has to basically memorize each turn in order to not get off the track or collide with the advertising signs.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "December 27, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Natsu System", "publishers": "Varie", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.75", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoru_Nakajima_F-1_Hero_GB_World_Championship_'91", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/121874\n"}
