{"name": "Dr. Franken II", "overview": "It is many years since Dr. Von Frankenbone passed on and Franky is in big trouble again! The late Doctor's castle, where Franky had spent many happy years with his girlfriend Bitsy, is crumbling and badly in need of repair. If this problems weren't already enough, the electricity company have finally caught up with him and presented him with a huge bill. Franky's only hope is to find the late Doctor's lost treasure; a golden tablet depicting the image of Bitsy, famed throughout the land, but now scattered and lost. Drastic situations call for drastic measures! Franky has fled Von Frankenbone's Castle and is sheltering in the Doctor's hidden Chateau. Unhappy at the thought of an uncontrolled monster on the loose, the local villagers have locked him in. It is your quest (as Franky) to search the Chateau for clues to the whereabouts of the lost fortune and to escape captivity so that you may search the estate grounds and beyond, from the depths of the ocean to the pyramids of Egypt. Only after much traveling may you return to pay off your debts. Franky is back - with new levels and new challenges, but hurry . . . time is running out!!", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "October 31, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "MotiveTime", "publishers": "Elite Systems Ltd.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.81", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyI46iuwMF8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/18048\n"}
