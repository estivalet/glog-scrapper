{"name": "Crystal Quest", "overview": "Buckle in and gear up for the classic galactic ride of your life. Far beyond known galaxies, the stars are scattered with precious crystals. As a renegade outer space prospector, your job is to scoop 'em up and bring 'em home. Just one problem: The brilliant glow of these gems attracts some of the universe's foulest pests. We call them nasties - and they're just that. So go ahead...zap the intergalactic vermin and cash in on the crystals. It's nasty-blastin' fun.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "September 1, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nova Logic", "publishers": "Data East", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.2", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Quest", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4_UCaMF5B4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/18009\n"}
