{"name": "Tesserae", "overview": "Tesserae is a 2D combination of Rubik's Cube and the more advanced levels of Q-Bert. Simple yet colorful symbol graphics allow for endless hours of gameplay akin to how one can play MineSweeper or Tetris for a long duration. Gameplay consists of flipping tesserae, or tiles, from squares over adjacent squares. The result would either create a complex tile, or cancel out, resulting in the deletion of a tile. The goal is to clear the board entirely. Higher levels have added tile complexity, and larger board grid sizes.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "August 1, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Eurocom", "publishers": "GameTek", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21147\n"}
