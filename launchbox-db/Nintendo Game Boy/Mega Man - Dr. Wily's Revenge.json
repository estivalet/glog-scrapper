And knowing the maniac he is, he's probably concocted a new one or two. Can you survive the eight empires before you break into Dr. Wily's lab? Well, if you experienced MegaMan before, you know it's no day at the beach. But good reason to get going on MegaMan in Dr. Wily's Revenge. Now. * When the stompin' cyclops springs into action, you better step on it. * The swooping copterheads just might be your greatest challenge yet. * If the giant fan is blowing, only a ledge-jump will save you from the spikes.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "July 26, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Minakuchi Engineering", "publishers": "Capcom", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.59", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_Man:_Dr._Wily%27s_Revenge", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/12629\n"}
