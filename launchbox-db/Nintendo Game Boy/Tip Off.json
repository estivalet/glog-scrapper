{"name": "Tip Off", "overview": "After the success with Kick Off and its sequel, Anco tried their hand at basketball. This basketball game has like the Kick Off games a top down view and the action is quite pacey, a trademark for many football games of the day (Kick Off in particular). The teams in the game are British but you can edit them using the built-in utilities. The game also has a tactics designer and the option to change the kits of each team. You can play either single matches or a full league competition. Tip Off can be played by four players simultaneously, so can play co-op with a friend against the computer, or just compete against one or two other players.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "March 19, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Enigma Variations", "publishers": "Imagineer", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/23466\n"}
