{"name": "Baseball", "overview": "Strategy, skill and determination. It takes all three to win at Baseball! Choose a starting pitcher from your bullpen. (Mario is an old favorite.) Hurl fastballs past the batter. If he connects, your outfield backs up to snag a fly. A sturdy infield backs you up on grounders and pop-ups. Three outs later and your team is up. Take a strike to feel out the pitcher. Then drive a long one. It's a home run!
