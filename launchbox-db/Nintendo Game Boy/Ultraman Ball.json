{"name": "Ultraman Ball", "overview": "Ultraman Ball is a 2D platformer for the Nintendo Game Boy and features the Tsuburaya Productions tokusatsu character Ultraman and his companions. Ultraman is re-imagined as a hero who is able to transform into a ball mode, and uses this new power to save his friends. In his standard bipedal form, Ultraman is able to cling onto walls and climb up them by repeatedly jumping. As the ball, Ultraman can bowl over enemies and build speed on slopes to help him reach new areas. He can also bounce, which also increases his vertical height. By combining these powers, the player can progress through each stage.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "December 22, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Interbec", "publishers": "Interbec", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/77733\n"}
