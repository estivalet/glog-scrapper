{"name": "Koi wa Kakehiki", "overview": "A rather interesting puzzle game the likes I've otherwise yet to see. With a small plot based off connecting the star-crossed lovers or something, your main goal is to shift tiles on a field to connect two distinct points while another person tries to do the same.
