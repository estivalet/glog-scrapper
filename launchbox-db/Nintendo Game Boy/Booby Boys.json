{"name": "Booby Boys", "overview": "Gameplay in Booby Boys is very simple. The goal of the level is to collect all of the sparkling chests. In doing so, a key will appear, which you can bring to a door in the level to go to the next one. There are ten levels in each world, and you freely choose to do each world in any order you want. The main impediment to this process -- other than the clock, which kills you if time runs out -- are the enemies. You can press the B Button to dig a hole and trap enemies within when they walk in. (Holes can also kill you on higher difficulties.) If you want to close a hole, press B while facing it; if an enemy is within, they'll die and you'll gain points. (They will be replaced with a tombstone, which cannot have a hole dug on it anymore.) You'll also possibly gain some items.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "June 25, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nichibutsu", "publishers": "Nichibutsu", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu2aTgoiRKE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/29885\n"}
