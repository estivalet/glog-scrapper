{"name": "F-1 Race", "overview": "Fire up your engines for the Nintendo grand prix! F-1 Race! You're at the wheel of a Formula 1 race car. You'll have to be a world class driver to stay on the course. Steer carefully, hugging the corners at over 250 KPH isn't easy! Fourteen race tracks take you around the world for a truly international challenge. Practice in the Time Trials, then enter the Nintendo grand prix. You can choose between two specially designed cars. The courses are tough, with dangerous turns and opposing cars. To find out if you're really good, use the Four Player Adapter and race with one to four players. Outmaneuver your friends, give it a burst of nitro and watch their faces as they eat your fumes!", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "February 1, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nintendo", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.43", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-1_Race", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puPPNaw0PKo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/3020\n"}
