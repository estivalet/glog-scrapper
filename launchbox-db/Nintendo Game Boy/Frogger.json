{"name": "Frogger", "overview": "Why DID the frog cross the road? Certainly not to be splattered by high-speed traffic, raging rivers, hungry alligators, slithering snakes, and crazy crocodiles! In Frogger, the timeless arcade classic, the goal of the game is simple, to safely maneuver 5 frogs across five lanes of busy traffic, a fast moving river, three lanes of treacherous logs, two lanes of swimming turtles, while avoiding snakes, alligators and crocodiles. Sounds easy? You'll need lots of skill, and a bit of luck, as you hop to victory, while trying not to become a highway statistic by leaving your \"mark\" on the roadway! - CLASSIC ARCADE STYLE GAME PLAY! - MULTIPLE LEVELS! - FOR ONE OR Two PLAYERS!", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "August 1, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Morning Star Multimedia", "publishers": "Majesco", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/22687\n"}
