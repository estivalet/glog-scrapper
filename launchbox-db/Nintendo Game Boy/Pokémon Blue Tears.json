{"name": "Pok\u00e9mon Blue Tears", "overview": "This is complete with 3 rules of Nuzlocke forced upon you, because if you're like me, you have the self control of a 4 year old. 1. Nicknames: This is forced upon you; you must nickname your Pokemon. 2. Faint = Death: This is what most people mean when they say they have made a Nuzlocke hack. If your entire team faints, the game resets, and you can load your last save. Save often! 3. Catch the First or Nothing: This was the biggest ... to code. I have a whitelist of 48 maps and map groups that are subject to these rules. Pokemon not caught via balls are not screened for. Didn't figure most people would care. I was even nice enough to wait until you can buy pokeballs to start blacklisting maps, so you can even catch things on route 1!", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "April 14, 2016", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Derrek Bertrand", "publishers": "", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.58", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ccaqv0uyCmE&feature=emb_title", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/124212\n"}
