Original Story: Monty having escaped from prison and now superfit so that he can quickly make his way to freedom through many hideouts and secret locations. The gold coins located throughout the game must be collected by Monty to enable hime to escape to freedom. The Gameboy version is based on Jason Perkins's Commodore 16/Plus 4 conversion, hence the reason why the character doesn't flip when he jumps like he does in the C64 and ZX Spectrum versions.
