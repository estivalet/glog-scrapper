{"name": "Lock n' Chase", "overview": "Despite the title, this is a sequel to the classic arcade game. Players take control of the thief Lupin as he runs around a maze, collecting coins and avoiding police. This new version of the game adds new mazes, power ups, hazards and more while carrying over the ability from the arcade version to lock doors behind you to block your pursuers. While the first game was basically a Pac-Man clone, this one is an evolution of the dot-muncher/maze chase genre.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "July 1, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Data East", "publishers": "Data East", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.12", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU5GtFgGgRQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21029\n"}
