{"name": "Death Track", "overview": "Death Track is a first person driving game set in a futuristic version of America where the player races against other opponents and competes in events to collect money. The player can use the money to buy weapons and upgrades to help seal their place in the competition and for taking on harder tracks. This early prototype of the game features two playable courses, a password menu, multiplayer support (support for four players possibly implemented, but untested), as well as a shop menu. The game features no sound or music, and is possibly missing the other courses.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Argonaut Games", "publishers": "", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/125586\n"}
