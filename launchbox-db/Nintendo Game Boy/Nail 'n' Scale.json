{"name": "Nail 'n' Scale", "overview": "In Nail 'n' Scale, the player controls Spike, a skilled climber. The player plays their way through levels of heightening difficulty. In each level, the player uses climbing spikes to navigate through the level to the door at the end of each level. The climbing spikes are also used to break bricks that block the path. There are 51 levels in all, with a boss on every tenth level. Each boss has his own unique weakness that must be exposed by the players before he can be defeated. While the first boss is not very intimidating, each subsequent boss becomes more frightening as the game progresses. Terrifying monsters can be defeating by firing the nail in either a horizontal or a vertical direction. Players can get killed by their own explosions; especially those caused by the exploding spikes that they can acquire much later in the game. There are even \"fake\" exits in certain levels of the game that try to pass themselves off as the \"true\" exit. Only the \"true\" exit permits access to the next level.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "April 1, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "I'Max", "publishers": "Data East", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.3", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_%27n%27_Scale", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21047\n"}
