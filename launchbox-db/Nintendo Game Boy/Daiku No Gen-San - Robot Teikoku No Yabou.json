{"name": "Daiku No Gen-San: Robot Teikoku No Yabou", "overview": "From the series of \"Hammerin' Harry\". The second Game Boy game takes out heroes to the final frontier - outer space. The basic gameplay is much the same as its predecessor, although it's a bit more difficult. At a few points, you'll be accompanied by some robot helpers, who show up at specific points in each stage to spring you over walls or supply extra firepower. It also has a particularly cool final battle where the roles are reversed - instead of being a lone character against a huge machine, you control a huge machine against one single character, a wily ninja who blinks in and out of existence. This one was only released in Japan.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "March 25, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Irem", "publishers": "Irem", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.71", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG01n_lWr8w", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/47936\n"}
