(\u201cSunshine Angel Marlowe: Panic in Bloomland!\u201d) or just \u201cAngel Marlowe\u201d is a weird game. It\u2019s essentially a puzzle game that\u2019s hard to categorize. Despite being released only in Japan, the game is fully playable for non-Japanese speakers. The only thing you would be missing is the brief story, but there is a fan translation patch for anyone curious about the game. The game consists of eight areas which you can beat in any order to unlock the final areas. Each area has a total of five stages that need to be beaten before you can clear the area and move onto the next one. Every area features a unique theme with cutesy graphics of enemies that are also surprisingly well animated for a GB game. The goal of each stage is to make all the flowers bloom while avoiding enemies and preventing them from destroying your work. An English prototype of the game called \"Philip & Marlowe in Bloomland\" was found in 2020, the prototype was developed by quest QUEST, before development switching to Technos.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "May 27, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Technos", "publishers": "Technos Japan Corp.", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/91363\n"}
