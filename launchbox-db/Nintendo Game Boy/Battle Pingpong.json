{"name": "Battle Pingpong", "overview": "In Battle Ping Pong the player can battle against ten AI enemies in a table tennis game. Those opponents represent ten countries which are humorously depicted, e.g. the USA athlete wears a cowboy hat. The goal of a single-player game is to beat all of them. Regarding gameplay, the player only has to hit the ball with the correct timing and can perform a few basic moves. The game is played in a first-person perspective: only the table tennis racket is visible.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "August 31, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Quest", "publishers": "Quest", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_Pingpong", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9SHZ6F0Oqw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/69037\n"}
