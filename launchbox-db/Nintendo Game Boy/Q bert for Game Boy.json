{"name": "Q*bert for Game Boy", "overview": "Hop Q*bert up and down the steps of a \"three-dimensional\" pyramid, changing each step's color as he lands. Complete the entire pyramid, and Q*bert moves to a more challenging pyramid. But look out! The crafty arcade creatures are here, too, and they're after Q*bert. Hop out of danger fast - or soar to safety on a flying disc. But watch where you move Q*bert. One hop off the pyramid and he'll be lost in space!", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "February 1, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Realtime Associates", "publishers": "Jaleco", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.41", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q*bert#Q.2Abert_for_Game_Boy", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/22682\n"}
