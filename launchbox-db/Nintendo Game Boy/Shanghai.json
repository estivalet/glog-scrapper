{"name": "Shanghai", "overview": "Steady your nerves and concentration. You're about to play Shanghai! Shanghai is based on an ancient game that's over 25 centuries old. Over the years since, it has been a favorite of pirates and smugglers, flappers and gangsters, of working men and the well-to-do. Now you can play it too! The game is simple... the strategy complex. Remove 144 tiles from a pyramid; two matching tiles at a time. But be careful. Remove the wrong two tiles and you're left with no more matching pairs... game over! It's a game everyone can play and enjoy.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "July 28, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "HAL Laboratory", "publishers": "HAL America", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.78", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21086\n"}
