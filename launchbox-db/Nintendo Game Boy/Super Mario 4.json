{"name": "Super Mario 4", "overview": "Super Mario 4 (aka Super Mario Land 4) is a hack of the Game Boy game Crayon Shin Chan 4, originally by Bandai. It is a very common title on multicarts, and can be difficult to obtain in stand-alone form. Super Mario 4 is one of the most commonly found hacks on the Game Boy. The hacker (who claims to be Nintendo) changed a large amount of content. The level design is completely different and is the main subject of the game's criticism due to the borderline unfair increase in difficulty when compared to Crayon Shin Chan 4; this issue is also caused by the lack of a password system and continues. The game has four levels, but each are incredibly lengthy. The story has been removed in an attempt to make the game look original, while most of the sprites are replaced with those from several Mario games (including Donkey Kong as the final boss) as well as the title screen which is based on the Japanese Super Mario 64 boxart. Yoshi is also in the game as a power-up, turning Mario into an invincible Yoshi with a powerful breath attack for a limited time.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "1997", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gamtec", "publishers": "Gamtec", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "http://bootleggames.wikia.com/wiki/Super_Mario_4", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBetNdXjcwE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/79422\n"}
