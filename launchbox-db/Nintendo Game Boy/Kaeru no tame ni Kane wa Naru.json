{"name": "Kaeru no tame ni Kane wa Naru", "overview": "In a land far away, the two princes\u2014Richard (of the Custard Kingdom) and the game's main protagonist (prince of the Sabl\u00e9 Kingdom)\u2014have shared a friendly rivalry since they were small children. They often compete, although it usually ends in a tie or close win. In Fencing however, Prince Richard is always the victor. One day a messenger arrives from a small neighboring kingdom, warning the princes that the evil King Delarin has invaded the Mille-Feuille Kingdom and captured the beautiful princess Tiramisu. In yet another boastful attempt to best the Sabl\u00e9 Prince, Richard grabs a boat and rushes towards the kingdom. The Sabl\u00e9 Prince is left trying to catch up. While on his journey, he and Richard (and many others) are transformed into frogs in an attempt to reveal the true happenings in this kingdom.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "September 4, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nintendo", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.04", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaeru_no_Tame_ni_Kane_wa_Naru", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/26354\n"}
