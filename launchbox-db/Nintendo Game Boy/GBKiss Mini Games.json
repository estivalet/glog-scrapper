Downloading on physical cartridge was accomplished by using a piece of hardware called GB KISS LINK, a modem that once connected to a Windows 95 PC allowed you to transfer downloaded content from your PC to your GB KISS capable game, always via IR. Once downloaded, a mini game can be transferred to another GB KISS cart directly, without the need of a PC and the modem.
