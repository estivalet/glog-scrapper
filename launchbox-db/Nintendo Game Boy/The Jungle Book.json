{"name": "The Jungle Book", "overview": "You\u2019re an Indian boy named Mowgli, and you were raised by a pack of wolves. No parents. No school. No problems. Great life, huh? Except there\u2019s a rumor that Shere Khan the man-eating tiger is coming after you. So now you\u2019ve got to sneak, swing and swoop your way through the jungle, catch the tiger by the tail and reach the safety of the man-village. To do this, you have to get the hang of incredibly tricky vines, neutralize venom balls, dodge coconut-throwing monkeys and fire off bananas at any scorpion, vampire bat, or crazy ape that gets in your way. So eat your potassium. It's a jungle out there!", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "August 1, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Eurocom Entertainment Software", "publishers": "Virgin Games", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.07", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jungle_Book_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21024\n"}
