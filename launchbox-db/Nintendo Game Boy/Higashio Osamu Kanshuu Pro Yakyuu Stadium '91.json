{"name": "Higashio Osamu Kanshuu Pro Yakyuu Stadium '91", "overview": "A baseball game sponsored by Osamu Higashio, a former pitcher for the Nippon Professional Baseball League who has his own entry in the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame. The game takes the vertically-aligned batter/pitcher angle favored by series like Namco's Famista series (from which RBI Baseball spun off), but mixes it up by changing the perspective depending on whether the player is pitching or batting: the player's team is always closer to the screen.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "August 9, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Tokuma Shoten", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/117069\n"}
