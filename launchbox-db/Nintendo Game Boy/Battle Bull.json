{"name": "Battle Bull", "overview": "Disaster has struck the deep space mining operation on Perseus VI. Remote control mining robots in the Mondo Oro 8 mine have been infected with a computer virus that has caused them to go beserk, attacking anything thatg enters the mine. The Company has enlisted you services to clear up this messy little problem. What's in it for you? Well the \"Bugs\", as they are called, not only mine the ore but also process it in their \"bodies\". Bash a bug, bag the bullion. That's right, you get to keep all the gold inside the bug when you crush it. No problem, right? Not so fast, Bud. You see, there are 48 levels to this mine and every level is littered with ore blocks. Also the bugs have destroyed all the elevators and you'll have to watch out for the open shafts. The elevator repair crews won't enter a level until you have cleared it so you will have to clear all the bugs before they can lower you down to the next level. Some of the bugs have buried themselves beneath the floor and will come out of hiding when they need reinforcements. After you clear a stage you can return to the surface and shop for equipment to mount on the Battle Bull, your specially modified combat dozer. You have a set amount of time to clear each stage before The Company sends in the Reclamation Units to seal of the level.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "January 1, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jorudan", "publishers": "SETA", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.39", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_Bull", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHw1VXngBUY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/17728\n"}
