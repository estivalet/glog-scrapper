{"name": "Battle of Kingdom", "overview": "Battle of Kingdom is a 1991 Game Boy video game that was jointly created by the Meldac, Live Planning, and the Lenar companies. It was only released for a Japanese market. The object is to lead a kingdom through various battles using the format of a traditional board game. In order to advance to the next battle, players must destroy at least 92% of the monsters on the battlefield. Each stage represents a battle in a high fantasy campaign to save the world from an unknown evil force (that resides in a skull castle). As players progresses to the right side of the screen, killing monsters from the enemy forces, the probability of winning the entire battle shows up in percentage. Players are unable to automatically attack the opponent if the number of points on the attack power meter becomes depleted. Attacking manually does not deduct attack points from the player's statistics, however. Monsters like slimes can face off against each other for control of the playing field in the lower levels of the game, while players are allowed in the upper levels of the game to summon the King's loyal army of archers, knights, horsemen and magicians. All these creatures must be bought in card form before being allowed to join the battlefield. Even the leader of each respective kingdom is expected to fight. The player's creatures can either fight, run away from battle, or cast a magic spell. All creatures have hit points, attack points, and special points.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "December 13, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Lenar", "publishers": "Meldac", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.83", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Kingdom", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ssP8K6DNmY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73799\n"}
