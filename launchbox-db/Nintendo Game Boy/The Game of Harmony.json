{"name": "The Game of Harmony", "overview": "ARE YOU GOOD ENOUGH FOR THIS GAME? Are you smart? Do you have quick reflexes? You are a single spinning sphere. You face a series of fantastic computer-generated puzzles - 50 of them. Your goal? Knock similar balls together and make them disappear. Sound simple? It's not. Each puzzle is different and requires a different strategy. Hit the wrong balls together and they multiply. If you don't clear the screen in time, the whole thing explodes. Whatever you've done before, forget it. Harmony's a whole new ball game. Beat this baby and you can call yourself good. Until then, you're just a pretender.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "February 1, 1991", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "The Code Monkeys", "publishers": "Accolade", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.08", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/18059\n"}
