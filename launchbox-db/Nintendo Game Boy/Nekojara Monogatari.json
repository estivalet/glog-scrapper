{"name": "Nekojara Monogatari", "overview": "Nekojara Monogatari -or Nekojara Story- is a 1990 JRPG released by Kemco on the original Game Boy utilising the same engine as used for Selection (The Sword of Hope) and astute role players will possibly recall Nekojara Island in The Sword of Hope II. Like The Sword of Hope games; Nekojara Monogatari is a first-person role playing game that actually plays more of an outdoors crawler than the usual indoors (dungeon) crawler but rather than humans and monsters involves cats and other less typical baddies You control a boy (well former boy) that upon winning the lottery is turned into a cat. The King of Catland offers to return you to human form but only after recovering the King\u2019s Triangle which is surely a play on the Triforce. The developers Kemco also published the first-person RPG games Shadowgate (NES) and Drakkhen (SNES) as well as a million Bugs Bunny and Top Gear games and more recently many iOS/Android JRPG\u2019s including a colour remake of this very game (which again sadly was never localised).", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "December 14, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Kemco", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://youtu.be/acKY4t9422U", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/116995\n"}
