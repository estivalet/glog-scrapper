{"name": "Bill & Ted's Excellent Game Boy Adventure", "overview": "A world without our most excellent compatriots Bill and Ted? No way! Yes way - if the Grim Reaper and the evil Bill and Ted robots get their way! DeNomolos wants to totally change the future, and the only way to stop this most heinous dude is to travel through the \"circuits of time\" and collect the stolen time fragments! 10 adventures - 50 quests. But watch out! Historical dudes like Billy the Kid are tumblin' with killer tumble weeds while the Executioner has an axe to grind with you. Napoleon has a \"short\" temper and even Granny S. Preston Esquire tries to bag you. Most bogus! Time is running out... so be excellent to each other and party on dudes! An evil plan to totally destroy your future? Bogus! Collect stolen historical fragments, like bodacious Billy the Kid's Sheriff Star. Run out of time and the most heinous Grim Reaper sends you to the land down under.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "September 1, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Beam Software", "publishers": "LJN", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.3", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_%26_Ted's_Excellent_Game_Boy_Adventure:_A_Bogus_Journey!", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRasOwGxOe4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/17734\n"}
