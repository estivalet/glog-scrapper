{"name": "Into the Blue", "overview": "If you have ever owned a Game Boy, you have almost certainly spent many hours with playing \u201cTetris\u201d. And if you have ever played \u201cTetris\u201d, you will almost certainly recognize some kind of resemblance when you first play \u201cInto the Blue\u201d. You will discover even more similarities if you compare it to \u201cTetris Attack\u201d, a lesser known variant of the same principle. In both \u201cTetris Attack\u201d and \u201cInto the Blue\u201d, you have a vertical playfield with panels raising from the bottom. The panels can be rearranged and will disappear if three (or more) matching panels are lined up in a horizontal or vertical row. The game is over if a panel touches the upper border of the playfield. But while it is true that \u201cInto the Blue\u201d and \u201cTetris Attack\u201d play very similarly, it is still not correct to call \u201cInto the Blue\u201d a \u201cTetris Attack\u201d clone. Actually, \u201cInto the Blue\u201d is based on a game that is even a few years older than \u201cTetris Attack\u201d and features slightly different game mechanics. That game, a Sega Genesis title by the name of \u201cMegapanel\u201d, is widely forgotten today \u2013 probably because it was never released on any other systems and never made its way out of Japan. Although there is no proof that \u201cMegapanel\u201d inspired the creators of \u201cTetris Attack\u201d, it seems reasonable to assume that they were familiar with the game and tried to improve it. So, what\u2019s the point in porting an obscure old game from one obsolete game console to another? First of all, I wanted to create a game that in spite of being similar to many other Game Boy titles, adds something new to the Game Boy library. But just like in my earlier \u201cRetroid\u201d project, the main reason was to learn more about the Game Boy and its capabilities. The technical differences between \u201cInto the Blue\u201d and its predecessor \u201cRetroid\u201d may not be obvious for the average player, but under the hood, everything has changed. And while many of the technical changes do not directly affect the gameplay, there is at least one technical improvement everybody can see: \u201cInto the Blue\u201d offers a competitive two player mode that is accessible if two Game Boys are connected via the link cable. But enough being said \u2013 why should you read about a game you can actually play?
