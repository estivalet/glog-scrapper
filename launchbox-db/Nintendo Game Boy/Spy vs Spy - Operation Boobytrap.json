{"name": "Spy vs Spy: Operation Boobytrap", "overview": "Players take on the role of a spy in white (or black), and go on a mission to go to four different locations and collect 4 items: a CD, passport, key and a sum of cash (and a brief-case to contain these things). But there's a snatch, another spy is also on the same mission. Players have to sweep him out of their way and collect the items before he does!", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "September 1, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Kotobuki System", "publishers": "Vatical", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spy_vs._Spy_(1984_video_game)", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-geX2eBsUbU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/8063\n"}
