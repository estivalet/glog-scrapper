{"name": "Mick & Mack as the Global Gladiators", "overview": "Global Gladiators is a 1992 platform game published and developed by Virgin Games, originally programmed by David Perry (who at the time had already moved to the United States and was located on the recently formed Virgin Games USA development studio) for the Mega Drive/Genesis and eventually ported by other Virgin Games teams in Europe (with the help of Graftgold and Krisalis Software) to the Master System, Game Gear and the Amiga. A Super NES and an NES port were also in development but were never completed for undisclosed reasons, though a ROM image has since surfaced. The game is based on the McDonald's fast food chain and has a strong environmentalist message. A Game Boy port of the title was also fully developed (by Damian Stones, of Climax) but was never released for the same legal reasons as the Super NES version.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Climax", "publishers": "", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.75", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Gladiators", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYo4W_ZKGN0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/124039\n"}
