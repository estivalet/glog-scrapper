{"name": "Janshirou", "overview": "Janshirou is a generic board game-based video game covering the intense strategy game of mahjong! your goal is to use the 13 tiles in your hand, plus one that you can draw or your opponent discards, to create some various hands. The end goal is to get \"mahjong\" - the use of all of those tiles in various hands or melds without \"overlapping\" the sets. These will obviously be based on two things. First is the tile's value - whether it is \"one\", \"two\", whatever. With the Circle and Bamboo suits, this is easy - just count the number of figures on there! At the title screen, you have several games you can play in: 1-Player Exhibition: Basically you and the AI in a nothing-really-matters match. 2-Player Exhibition: Exhibition match involving two Game Boys connected with the link cable. ?: For some reason, this doesn't work. Presumably a link cable-based option, given by limited resources. Story Mode: Basically a series of progressively-harder mahjong matches. Mahjong Simulator: Should be pretty obvious.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "March 27, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Sammy Studios", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/117001\n"}
