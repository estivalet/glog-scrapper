{"name": "Spot: The Video Game", "overview": "While the gameplay is similar to \"Reversi\", Spot: The Video Game offered an animated approach to moving the pieces. Depending on the proximity and direction of the move, the Spot character would appear as the moving piece and do a dance, roller skate, cart wheel, dive, fall backwards, etc. to the destination location. The player wishing to move would first select the piece they desired to move, followed by selecting the destination location.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "December 31, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Virgin Mastertronic", "publishers": "Virgin Mastertronic", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot:_The_Video_Game", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/18017\n"}
