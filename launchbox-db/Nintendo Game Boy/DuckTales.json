{"name": "DuckTales", "overview": "The game sees players in the role of Scrooge McDuck as he travels across the world in search of five treasures to further increase his fortune. Scrooge is able to attack enemies and get around using his cane. On the ground, Scrooge can swing his cane to attack enemies and break open or throw certain objects. While jumping, Scrooge can bounce on his cane like a pogo stick to attack enemies from above. This also allows him to reach higher areas, as well as bounce across hazardous areas that would hurt him on foot. Along the way, Scrooge can find various diamonds, found in treasure chests or appearing in certain areas, to increase his fortune and ice cream that can restore his health. Scrooge will also encounter various characters from the series who have various roles, such as providing hints, offering up items and opening up new areas.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "November 1, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Capcom", "publishers": "Capcom", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DuckTales_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHmo9pmFDtk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2737\n"}
