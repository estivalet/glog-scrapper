{"name": "Retroid", "overview": "\u201cRetroid\u201d is a Game Boy game based on the classic arcade game that was originally published as \u201cBreakout\u201d by Atari and later brought to perfection as \u201cArkanoid\u201d by the Japanese software firm Taito. The player controls a paddle at the bottom of the screen that reflects a ball to destroy bricks at the top of the screen. That simple but addictive game principle has probably been copied more often than \u201cSpace Invaders\u201d, \u201cPac-Man\u201d or \u201cTetris\u201d. For the Game Boy, there are at least two versions, a simplistic knock-off called \u201cAlleyway\u201d and a much more sophisticated interpretation titled \u201cKirby\u2019s Block Ball\u201d. \u201cSo, why then create another clone for an out-dated game console?\u201d, you might ask.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "2016", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Jonas Fischbach", "publishers": "Jonas Fischbach", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvXC3RDL4wQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/126778\n"}
