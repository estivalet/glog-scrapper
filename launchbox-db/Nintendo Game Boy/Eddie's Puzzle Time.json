{"name": "Eddie's Puzzle Time", "overview": "Unreleased 1994 title for Gameboy, It was about 99% completed with most of the features. Passwords have not been finalized. Eddies Puzzle Time was written in 1993/94 under the game\u2019s company, Hookstone (Zoop, Sentinel Returns). After Alfred Chicken was complete, Peter Tattersall did the graphics, David Bland did 90% of the level design, but all 3 of the team created levels for Eddie. Jason McGann did the programming. The game was in development for around 4 months. The team had tried pitching it to publishers at the time, but it was seen as a \u201crisk\u201d and deemed too expensive to promote. The game ran on a 64k cartridge. Eventually the team was asked by Sunsoft to make a version of Alfred Chicken in Japanese, so Eddie\u2019s was put a side and forgot about. After the Alfred Japanese version, we started looking at Eddie again. We looked into randomly generating levels and ported it to PC. We iterated a few approaches and eventually Zoop, so Eddie\u2019s is in fact a precursor to Zoop.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hookstone", "publishers": "", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/126483\n"}
