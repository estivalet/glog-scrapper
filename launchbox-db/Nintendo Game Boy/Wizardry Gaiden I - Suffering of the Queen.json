{"name": "Wizardry Gaiden I: Suffering of the Queen", "overview": "The power of the Staff of Gnilda, the artifact that protects the city to Llylgamyn is fading. Queen Iris's sister, Sorx went missing a year ago, along with the evil mage Thailand Rossum (nicknamed Taros in fan-translation). The Queen has called upon adventurers to defeat Thailand Rossum and find her sister. Your party of adventurers has heeded this call. Wizardry Gaiden is a side story Wizardry game for Gameboy. It is an original, Japanese-only title, and is not a port of any computer versions. Its developer, ASCII, was also the developer that created the Wizardry 1 through 6 remakes for Famicom and Super Famicom, and as such Wizardry Gaiden retains much of the same look and feel of other console titles in the series. The gameplay system most closely resembles Wizardry V (released the following year for Super Famicom), with the addition of long-range weapons, enhanced spells, and auto-mapping.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "October 1, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "ASCII Entertainment", "publishers": "Ascii Entertainment", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73929\n"}
