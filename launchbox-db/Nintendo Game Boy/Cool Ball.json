Then along comes the BIG BANG and *WHAM* - off she goes flying through time, screaming for help! She's counting on you to travel through time and find her! You'll need to collect various objects along the way, all of which must be collected in order to complete each level. You'll encounter hungry piranhas, gnarly pterodactyls, giant killer rats and treacherous swooping birds on your journey. So think fast and keep on bouncing!", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "New Frontier", "publishers": "Takara", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je6racM-bFs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/18033\n"}
