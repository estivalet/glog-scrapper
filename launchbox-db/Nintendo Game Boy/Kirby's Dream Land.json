{"name": "Kirby's Dream Land", "overview": "The gluttonous King Dedede has stolen all of the food from the inhabitants of Dream Land for a midnight feast, so Kirby, a resident of Dream Land, goes to retrieve the food and stop Dedede. Kirby's Dream Land plays like other platformers of the 8-bit and 16-bit era of video games: Kirby must use various natural abilities and occasionally external abilities or items while heading toward the goal at the end of each level. Like many 1980s-era platformers, the player can accumulate points, with an extra life granted when the player has enough points. However, because Kirby lacks a save function, scores are not recorded. Also, there are no save files, so the player has to start over again when the Game Boy is turned off, if the player chooses to return to the title screen after a Game Over, or if the player resets the game. All levels are played on a two-dimensional plane, letting Kirby move only left, right, up, and down. Kirby can walk, jump, and fly. Kirby can also inhale objects and enemies, swallowing them or spitting them out as projectiles.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "April 17, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "HAL Laboratory", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.13", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirby%27s_Dream_Land", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJjcHAU5jb8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/8377\n"}
