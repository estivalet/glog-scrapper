{"name": "Flappy Special", "overview": "Flappy Special is a port of Flappy. The main difference is that the game features two playing modes with 80 levels each: one is puzzle oriented while the other features more enemies. The levels themselves are a mix between the levels featured in the PC-88 and NES versions. The game itself is a puzzle game in which the player controls a mole who has to push a blue stone on an specially marked place. The stone can only be pushed, but not pulled. While Flappy does not care about gravity, the blue and red stones do: they fall down if pushed off an edge. This has to be used to clear a path for the blue stone and to crush enemies which try to hurt Flappy. Touching them or being crushed by a stone results in the loss of a life.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "March 23, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "dB-SOFT", "publishers": "Victor Musical Industries", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.62", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ratpjqTp_Sc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/26359\n"}
