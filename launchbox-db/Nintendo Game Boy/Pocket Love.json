{"name": "Pocket Love", "overview": "A bishoujo, or beautiful girl game. Starting the second year of high school, YOU (input name at the beginning) are the protagonist. Your new life starts from the first day of school (April 14th) and ends when you confess your love to one of the heroines on Christmas (December 25th). At the beginning of each week, you select two activities to \"work on\" and \"try your best at\" for each day of the week. The activity selected will raise the appropriate stat (studying raises KNOWLEDGE, personal grooming raises LOOKS). By raising the right stat, it's possible to deepen the relationship with certain heroines. Most of the gameplay is watching in-game events with different results based on your current stat. On Sundays, it's possible to select where you want to go for the day, such as going to the game center or using the money you earned at your part-time for gifts. CDs of voice actresses reading the lines of the characters were released with some copies of the game, making it possible to listen to the heroines speaking instead of simply reading their lines.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "July 18, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "KID Corp.", "publishers": "KID Corp.", "genres": "Life Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZLJudXdhPE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/117092\n"}
