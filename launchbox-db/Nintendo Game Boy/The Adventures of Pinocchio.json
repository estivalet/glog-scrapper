{"name": "The Adventures of Pinocchio", "overview": "The Adventures of Pinocchio is an Action game, developed by Bit Managers and published by Infogrames, which was cancelled before it was released. The ROM bears an internal title of \"Infrey Quest,\" apparently a working title used early in production before Infogrames requested alterations to re-configure the game as a (non-Disney) \"Pinocchio\" title. The game was thereafter cancelled, but would eventually resurface in 1998 in a re-reworked version called \"Ottifants,\" based on the German comic strip of same name.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "January 1, 1993", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "", "developers": "Bit Managers", "publishers": "Infogrames", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHTBTC2qouE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/94662\n"}
