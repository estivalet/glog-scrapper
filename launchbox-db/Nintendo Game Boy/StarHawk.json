{"name": "StarHawk", "overview": "Can You Survive the Ceaseless Attack of Freakish Alien Mutants? As a master mariner aboard the scout ship StarHawk, you have been sent to explore the Evil Empire of Axtar. You were preprared for almost anything - anything but the rampant mutants that ingest this raging realm of never-ending combat. Half organic, half technological, the freakish life forms of Axtar have only one instinct: to attack. Hordes of alien beasties come at you from all sides as your ship is transported from world to world through five levels. You shudder at the sight of grotesque globule-emitting eyeballs, terrifying buzzsaw-like energy disks, implacable poison jetting phenocrysts, and huge end-level bosses. As the battle rages on, you'll need nerves of steel and lightning quick reflexes to survive!", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "June 1, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "NMS Software", "publishers": "Accolade", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.65", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21104\n"}
