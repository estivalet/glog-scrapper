{"name": "Raging Fighter", "overview": "Raging Fighter is a one-against-one fighting game. The background scenario is the Omega League which is supposed to sift out the best fighter in the universe. Each of the seven fighters has a variety of punches and kills - which one gets performed depends on which directions on the d-pad are pressed. Every fighter differs from the others with two special attacks which are triggered by pressing the right button combination and a few statistics like speed or defense. Besides the story mode, the player can also participate in the training mode with a motionless opponent, a tournament or two-player matches. The winner of a match is whoever wins two rounds out of three.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "March 26, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.45", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raging_Fighter", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/12658\n"}
