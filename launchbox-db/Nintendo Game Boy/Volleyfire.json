{"name": "Volleyfire", "overview": "Volleyfire is a shooter with simple gameplay mechanics: Two space ships (in later levels up to three against the player) are placed on the lower respectively upper side of the screen, can move left or right and try to shoot each other. Between them are obstacles which obfuscate the shots and, depending on the level, may move horizontally or vertically. When the latter is the case, a collision should be avoided. Every successful shot lowers the energy bar of the opponent and when it runs out (or all of them in case of multiple enemies), a life is lost. After one of of the sides has lost three lives, the match is over.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "June 29, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Toei Animation", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.38", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThvMtzO82BM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/26358\n"}
