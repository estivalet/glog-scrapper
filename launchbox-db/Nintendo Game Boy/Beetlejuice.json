{"name": "Beetlejuice", "overview": "It's your pal Beetlejuice, here to bamboozle those bewitchers from the Netherworld vacationing at lovely Lydia's place. This house is HAUNTED! Flying cups and saucers and clothes that spring to life cause quite a panic...especially when they're coming for you! It's a horrific 5 level challenge to spook attic ghastlies, rattle angry skeletons and scare ghostly bats. Vampires may even join you for a \"bite\" to eat. Hmm...maybe we should skip lunch today. These Netherworld ghoul-o-ramas are no match for us. Has the \"ghost with the most\" ever let you down?!!", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "January 1, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Rare", "publishers": "LJN", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.9", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beetlejuice_(handheld_video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPQrIf3kiUc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/17732\n"}
