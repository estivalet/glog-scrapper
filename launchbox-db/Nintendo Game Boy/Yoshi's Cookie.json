{"name": "Yoshi's Cookie", "overview": "Yoshi's Cookie is a fast-paced puzzle game. The player moves randomly placed cookies into rows and columns of cookies with similar patterns. When a row or column of the same cookies is successfully assembled, the line will disappear, and the player can begin to work on a new row or column. The \"Yoshi\" cookie is very special in both the 1-player and the 2-player game. Since this cookie is the key to both games, it should be used wisely.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Bullet-Proof Software", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.62", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshi's_Cookie", "video_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshi%27s_Cookie", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/18147\n"}
