{"name": "Jelly Boy", "overview": "Jelly Boy puts in the control of a jelly baby with morphing powers, sort of like if A Boy and His Blob merged together in some ungodly ritual. His quest is to find various items inside a weird factory so that the elevator doorman will allow him to go up and meet the dude in charge. Awesome music, polished graphics, a whole bunch of detailed levels and worlds and a bizarre sense of humor brighten up an otherwise generic platformer.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "March 1, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Probe Entertainment", "publishers": "Ocean Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.06", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jelly_Boy", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22qMTEAhvTw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/23420\n"}
