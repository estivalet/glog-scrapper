{"name": "Ranma 1/2: Netsuretsu Kakutouhen", "overview": "This Gameboy game is one of the best simply because it immerses you in the life of Ranma. One part RPG, one part fighting game, here you guide Ranma around in side-scrolling fashion as he wanders around the house, town, and school talking to people and getting into fights. Somewhat like a very simplistic version of Shenmue. The game begins with Ranma and Akane talking about a letter from the Jusenkyo Guide. We're introduced to some of the other characters who appear in this game: Colonge, Shampoo, Mousse, Genma, and Ryoga.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "July 17, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "R.
