{"name": "Legend of the Mana Sword", "overview": "Legend of the Mana Sword focuses on making the first game of the Mana series both a better experience for first time players, and more fun for returning players. If you\u2019ve never played a Mana game before, Legend of the Mana Sword is a good place to start your adventure. If you\u2019ve already played later Mana games, it will be familiar yet new. If you\u2019ve previously played the original (whether it was called Final Fantasy Adventure, Mystic Quest, or Seiken Densetsu) then Legend of the Mana Sword helps the game you remember better live up to its true potential.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "August 21, 2022", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "xenophile", "publishers": "Romhacking.net", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165638\n"}
