{"name": "Gekitou Power Modeler", "overview": "The gameplay of Power Quest is a mixture of two genres: role-playing and fighting. The player ventures around the town in which they live on an overworld map. Once arrived at a location, a character appears on the screen with some dialogue. More often than not this dialog involves the character challenging to a fight. After challenged by a character, the game switches to a one-on-one fighting game engine. This is the role-playing battle system which differs from the usual turn-based battle engines of the genre. New parts can be bought for a model, which is how experience is gained throughout the game. Progress through the game by challenging a certain number of people before the next event is triggered. Special events pop up throughout the game after this number is met which usually involve a tournament or beating some strong boss-type character. The game also allows to save progress with a password. Due to the limited number of statistics that can be tracked, the password feature is able to track parts, accrued money, and current model.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "November 27, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Japan System House", "publishers": "Capcom", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n07y29mun98", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/109089\n"}
