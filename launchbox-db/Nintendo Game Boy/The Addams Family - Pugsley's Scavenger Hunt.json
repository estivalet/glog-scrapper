{"name": "The Addams Family: Pugsley's Scavenger Hunt", "overview": "Darling little Pugsley has lost his family to kidnappers who have hidden them as prisoners in their own spooky home. Only lovable little Pugsley can rescue them by hunting for delightfully strange items located in secret spots in their weird mansion. What oddities and atrocities await him! There are twisted creatures and complex features at every turn of the task. If precious little Pugsley is able, he'll find and rescue Gomez, Granny, Wednesday and Uncle Fester and see them to the music room. Each one holds a piece of the unnaturally lovely music which Lurch must play to unlock the secret passage leading to Morticia. Pugsley's only helper is the charmingly bizarre Thing, who brings him startling messages to help him along. So get ready to get spooky and get set to get kooky... it's Pugsley's Scavenger Hunt!", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "July 1, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Enigma Variations", "publishers": "Ocean Software Ltd.", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.45", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Addams_Family_(video_game_series)#The_Addams_Family:_Pugsley's_Scavenger_Hunt", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRziIVyVQpI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/17703\n"}
