{"name": "Burai Fighter Deluxe", "overview": "For thousands of years, the Burai had but one objective: the conquest of the universe! They have created huge armies of robo-mutants - half robot and half living flesh. With capabilities to produce thousands of robo-mutants each day, the Burai armies will soon overrun the galaxy - unless you can stop them! Strap on your proton pack, charge up your laser cannon, and prepare to do battle with the deadliest army of mutant rogues to come along in years. Your challenge is to penetrate the five bases of the Burai, confront the super-mutant guards: monstrous creatures like Giganticrab, Jawsipede, Fangskull, and ultimately you'll face the terrifying Slimedragon! Using your awesome arsenal of weapons, victory may be within your reach. Contains password feature and many difficulty levels. Can you save the universe from the torment of evil Burai? We're all depending on you!", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "January 1, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Taxan", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.2", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burai_Fighter#Deluxe", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suUqogcHB70", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/17756\n"}
