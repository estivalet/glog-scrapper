{"name": "Chase H.Q.", "overview": "When H.Q. radios you the bad guy's stats, you don't just follow that car, you bash it. Or smash it. Or do anything it takes to rid the road of thugs. So stomp on the gas and feel the heat waves rise. This hot arcade hit gives you hundreds of miles of screaming, twisting LA highways to master. And never enough time to relax. At the start of each level the player is informed who they are pursuing, a great distance away: They must apprehend the criminal before their time limit expires. The criminal's car is constantly moving away, so if the player repeatedly crashes or drives too slowly, the criminal will escape. At some points during the game the road splits, and the correct turn must be taken, otherwise it will take longer to catch the criminal. When their vehicle is reached, the time limit is extended; the vehicle must be rammed a number of times until the criminal is forced to stop, then is arrested.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "December 31, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "B.I.T.S.", "publishers": "Taito", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.11", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chase_H.Q.", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_5cH7l-FFo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/18036\n"}
