{"name": "Dino Breeder", "overview": "Dino Breeder starts with the player being able to choose one of six dinosaur eggs. The player then gets to keep whichever dinosaur hatches from the egg and gets to name it. The dinosaur can be fed, trained, or get into a battle. There is a story which can be progressed through by meeting certain criteria. Dinosaurs have a set amount of hit points and if they are taken down to zero they will die leaving players the option to start the whole game over or start again at the last checkpoint with the current dinosaur.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "August 22, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Digital Kids", "publishers": "J-Wing", "genres": "Life Simulation", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/76551\n"}
