{"name": "Rope & Bombs", "overview": "Rope & Bombs is a puzzle game for the Nintendo Game Boy, written in assembly by Swedish developer Team Lampoil. This game is freeware but physical copies exist and were sold at Retrospelsfestivalen in Malmoe, Sweden in September 2017. Rope & Bombs is a puzzle game where pieces of rope and bombs fall from above. The player tries to connect the rope as much as possible. Every once in a while, a fire appears. The fire burns any rope connected to it. The goal is to burn as much rope as possible, as when the rope reaches the top of the screen, the game is over. Any bombs touched by fire will (you guessed it) explode, destroying any rope near it.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "September 9, 2017", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Team Lampoil", "publishers": "", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/150455\n"}
