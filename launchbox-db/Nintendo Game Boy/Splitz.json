{"name": "Splitz", "overview": "A game so simple yet so exciting that your nerves will start to tingle right from the very start. What can be simpler than arranging a few blocks to make a picture? Kid's stuff! Alas! the very block you want, is likely to shoot out the door or bounce off the wall. Wait a minute! Is that a bomb that has just come out of the chute? It may be a petrol can, harmless until you put a match to it and lose a life or pour water on, to neutralize it and earn bonus points. Twelve pictures to complete PLUS bonus levels. As time runs out and hazards increase, each level becomes a new and exciting challenge. A special version of Splitz with modified graphics was handed out for 6000 lottery winners in December 16, 1994 , organized by Famicom Shop Wanpaku Kozo.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "June 25, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Enigma Variations", "publishers": "Imagineer", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/23459\n"}
