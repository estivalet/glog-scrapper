{"name": "Pinball Fantasies", "overview": "After the success of Pinball Dreams on several systems, a sequel featuring four new tables was created. The gameplay is much the same as the first game, with realistic physics, multi-player options and a high score table to aim for. The tables are Partyland, Speed Devils, Billion Dollar Gameshow and Stones 'n' Bones, taking in a funfair, racing cars, a tacky game-show, and a graveyard. Each one has a range of ramps, combos, light sequences and targets to shoot, as well as general themes which are less influenced by real tables than those in Pinball Dreams.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "February 1, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Spidersoft", "publishers": "GameTek", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinball_Fantasies", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21060\n"}
