{"name": "Snow Brothers", "overview": "Snow Bros. is a 1992 Game Boy port of the 1990 platform arcade video game originally developed by Toaplan. The in-game title screen is \"Snow Bros Jr.\" Game play is similar to similar to Bubble Bobble. Unlike the 2-player arcade version, the 1992 Game Boy release is single-player only and changes the story to compensate for this by having one of the titular snowmen twins be kidnapped while the other sets out to rescue him. Several other aspects of the game were changed due to the technical restrictions of the Game Boy, such as bosses that originally fought in pairs in the arcade version now fight alone and potions are now given different shape due to the lack of color display on the original Game Boy. The Game Boy version also adds an extra set of 10 levels after the 50 levels adapted from the arcade version are cleared. General game play is similar to arcade where the player must throw snow at each enemy until it is completely covered, turning it into a snowball allowing the enemy to be pushed or kicked into other enemies. If left alone, enemies will eventually defrost. An enemy partially covered in snow cannot move until it shakes it off.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "January 1, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "ToaPlan", "publishers": "Capcom", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.61", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_Bros", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21096\n"}
