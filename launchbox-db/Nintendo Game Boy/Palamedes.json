{"name": "Palamedes", "overview": "Palamedes is a puzzle game requiring the player to match the dice they are holding to the dice at the top of the screen. Using the \"B\" button, the player can change the number on his/her dice, then throw the dice using the \"A\" button when it matches the dice at the top of the screen, which wipes the target dice off the screen. The player can play in \"solitaire\" mode against the computer or another player, or \"tournament\" mode against AI opponents. There are six sides and numbers on the dice, making an attempt to match all the numbers on the screen and eliminating them a challenge.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "October 12, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Natsu System", "publishers": "Hot-B", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.79", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palamedes_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/23437\n"}
