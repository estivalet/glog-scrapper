{"name": "Painter Momopie", "overview": "In Painter Momopie the player has the important task to wipe all the castle floors. The castle is divided into several rooms which have to be finished within a time limit one after another. Those rooms have varying layouts with more open spaces, tight gangways or dead ends - but every field is dirty. Cleaning is the simple matter of walking over a tile and if everything is clean, the level is done. However, there are also ghosts walking around the rooms which kill the player at touch. The protagonist has access to a few magic spells which grant advantages when used, e.g. a time stop, killing a near enemy or speed up. Each spell costs a certain amount of magic points.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "December 7, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sigma Enterprises, Inc.", "publishers": "Sigma Enterprises, Inc.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/117010\n"}
