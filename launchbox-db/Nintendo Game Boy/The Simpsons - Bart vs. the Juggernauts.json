{"name": "The Simpsons: Bart vs. the Juggernauts", "overview": "Bart Simpson here, on my way to the Springfield Arena to do battle with the Juggernauts, my all-time TV heroes. It isn't going to be easy. There's nobody tougher than the Juggernauts (except maybe yours truly), but I'll be fighting 'em out on my own turf: Krustyland Amusement Park, Moe's Tavern, and the Nuclear Power Plant, just to name a few. No one knows this, but I've got a whole new set of cool manoeuvres AND a new technological edge - I can CHEAT! I'm psyched. I'm ready to rock and roll. On to victory, Man! Your pal, Bart Simpson.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "September 1, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Imagineering", "publishers": "Acclaim", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.27", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons:_Bart_vs._The_Juggernauts", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21089\n"}
