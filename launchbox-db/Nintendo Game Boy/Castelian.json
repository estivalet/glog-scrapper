{"name": "Castelian", "overview": "Julius is his name. Demolition is his game. Eight colossal towers that almost crack the sky! You and Julius - the Anurian Hybrid - are charged with the task of collapsing the alien towers. As Julius climbs and leaps across the face of each tower, he is confronted by potent and very deadly adversaries. Roving Hexalons, scanning I-Balls, orbiting Spheroids and dissolving pathways threaten you at every turn. Their mere touch will cost you your life! Yet, somehow, you must reach the tower's top in order to detonate your powerful D-bombs! Your courage, skill and determination will guide you to the summit of Castelian. Fire your Carbonobombs, catch the high-speed elevator, and escape into the doorways of the unknown. The island's future depends upon you and Julius. Watch him, learn his secrets and demolition will become your game!", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "May 1, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "B.I.T.S.", "publishers": "Storm", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.7", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebulus_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rdr6oR3M1g", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/18013\n"}
