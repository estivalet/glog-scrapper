On the way to deliver a present, Pete came along and stole it. The gameplay is a general side-scrolling action game where players destroy enemies with Super Mario World-like blocks. However, the gameplay deviates from the standard Super Mario type of platforming by not allowing Mickey/Minnie to stomp on the enemy's head There are items that grant temporary invincibility along with a 1-up and boosts to the player's health.Players have to navigate a lake, the summit of a mountain, through a vast forest, and even stroll through the shopping center while avoiding insects, small mammals, and snowballs. All of these enemies appear in their appropriate levels (i.e., no ghosts in the town level, no flying squirrels in the haunted house level. Nintendo Power magazine gave this game a 68% in their March 1991 issue.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Now Production", "publishers": "Capcom", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.12", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey's_Dangerous_Chase", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/18113\n"}
