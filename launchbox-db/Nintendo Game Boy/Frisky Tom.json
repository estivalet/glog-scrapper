{"name": "Frisky Tom", "overview": "Frisky Tom is a 1981 arcade game by Nichibutsu. The object of the game is to provide enough water for a shower by crawling along a network of plumbing pipes and picking up/replacing loose pieces. Various types of mice are the game's antagonists, trying to thwart Tom in different ways: knocking pipes loose to disrupt the water flow, jumping down to fall on him, or setting a bomb to blow up the entire plumbing arrangement. A version for the Atari 5200 was programmed in 1983, but was never published.It was, however, released for the Nintendo Game Boy in 1995 and the PlayStation in 2002. A Bandai Electronics VFD hand held version of Frisky Tom was released in 1982. Mouskattack, another game featuring both mice and a pipe-laying theme, was published in 1982 by Sierra On-Line for the Atari 8-bit family and Apple II.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "July 14, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Nichibutsu", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frisky_Tom", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/89357\n"}
