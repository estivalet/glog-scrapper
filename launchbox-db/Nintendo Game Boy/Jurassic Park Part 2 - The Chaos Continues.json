{"name": "Jurassic Park Part 2: The Chaos Continues", "overview": "Jurassic Park 2 follows up its impressive cut scene with conventional side-scrolling run and gun style. The player(s) can select their level from a list and play through the game's stages in any order; however, \"emergency\" missions also appear after each level is completed, and the order of these stages does not change. Some stages offer a simple flat design, some have a platforming focus and others feature a maze of doorways which must be navigated to locate the exit. Grant and Wolfskin can choose among three lethal weapons (rifle, machine gun, shotgun), and three non-lethal weapons (electric stun gun, tranquilizer gun, and gas grenade launcher). The lethal rounds are effective against humans and dinosaurs, while the non-lethal rounds are designed to incapacitate dinosaurs without killing them, so as to preserve InGen's investment; if the number of dinosaurs killed with lethal weapons by the player becomes too high, the game will end. Non-lethal rounds do not affect humans, while killing Raptors with lethal rounds will not affect the number of dinosaurs killed.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "December 1, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Ocean Software Ltd.", "publishers": "Ocean Software Ltd.", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.14", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_Park_2:_The_Chaos_Continues", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/18110\n"}
