{"name": "Daffy Duck", "overview": "YOU MUST BE DAFFY TO PLAY THIS! Daffy Duck becomes legendary space hero Duck Dodgers in the 24th and a 1/2 Century once again to match wits and lasers with his old nemesis Marvin the Martian! It seems Marvin the Martian is out to conquer the galaxy and only a stubborn space cadet like Duck Dodgers can thwart his evil plans. Armed with an Acme Jet-pack and ray gun the heroic duck leaps into this crazy adventure! Blast bizarre alien creatures to atoms, evade treacherous boody traps and duck out of danger in the nick of time! Action and excitement are here in this thrilling space saga for Daffy fans of all ages! Shrinking rays and crushing platforms are commonly seen as the player tries to kill Martians that are standing in the way along with rock monsters and dragons. Lava won't instantly kill the player's character but falling into a bottomless pit will. In the end, Marvin the Martian must be destroyed in the final stage of the game. The Game Boy version includes a secret \"hard\" difficulty level. Losing in this difficulty level will simply reset the game instead of bringing up the game over screen.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "September 30, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sunsoft", "publishers": "Sunsoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.67", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daffy_Duck:_The_Marvin_Missions", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZgYzfzpV6c", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/18039\n"}
