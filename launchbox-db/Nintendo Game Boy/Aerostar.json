{"name": "Aerostar", "overview": "World War VI left the Earth desolate and inhabitable. Many years later, the Intergalactic Council discovered that Earth could once again be populated, and people returned to rebuild their lives. Unknown to them, mutant forces had gone undetected, and are now wrecking havoc on the defenseless humans. Fearing the total extermination of the Earth, the Intergalactic Council has deployed AEROSTAR, the most powerful fighter ever built. This state-of-the-art vehicle of destruction is Earth's only hope for salvation, but is useless without the right pilot... Note: This game was re-released by Sunsoft circa 1998-2000. The barcode is different and the Vic Tokai logo has been eliminated on the box/cart artwork in favor of the Sunsoft logo, but otherwise the two releases are identical.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "June 28, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sigma Pro-Tech", "publishers": "Sunsoft", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.87", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerostar_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZPQFbCS2Ww", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/17706\n"}
