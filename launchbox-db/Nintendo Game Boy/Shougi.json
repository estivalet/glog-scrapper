{"name": "Shougi", "overview": "Shougi was the third Game Boy release to revolve around an endemic Japanese pastime, and the third Game Boy release never to see a release in the West. Japanese pastimes like shogi, however, stood as the exception. Like Yakuman and Pachinko Time before it, Pony Canyon\u2019s Shogi featured a tabletop game that\u2019s never found its way beyond Asia\u2026 though in this case, it\u2019s not because shogi is particularly unique to Japan but rather because the West already has its own variant: Chess. The two classic games are essentially the same thing, minus some differences in rules and aesthetics. But the two are sufficiently redundant that Americans have no need for shougi\u2026 yet sufficiently different that publishers can\u2019t just reskin a shuogi game and pass it off as chess, either. Another similarity between Shougi, Yakuman, and Pachinko Time: This Game Boy release was a part of something akin to a tradition for its publisher, Pony Canyon. Just as Nintendo had released a few mahjong games before Yakuman and Coconuts Japan was all about dressing up virtual pachinko with the trappings of an adventure game, Pony Canyon specialized in shougi titles.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "December 19, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Pony Canyon", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fKIQ8oQJ7Q", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/117356\n"}
