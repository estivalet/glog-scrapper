{"name": "Parodius", "overview": "This is mostly the parody of Gradius (Nemesis on some systems), with some flavor from other shoot-em-ups, like Twinbee. The series is available on numerous platforms. The game is a right-to-left scrolling shoot-em-up. You can choose from 4 different flying creatures, with different weapons. You must finish 7 stages, each having a boss at the end. You may start at either one, but must complete every level to advance to the final stage.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "January 1, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Palcom", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.02", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parodius_(series)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gro88l-WdiM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/23439\n"}
