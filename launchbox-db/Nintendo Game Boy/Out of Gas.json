{"name": "Out of Gas", "overview": "You are cruising around in outer space when suddenly you are out of gas. The game is played from an top-down view. The gameplay is not very far from Asteroids, where you are the pilot of a ship and must complete level after level. For each level your objective is to get gas by shooting at the G-signs scattered around the levels. In some levels you have to shoot the signs in a special order. The levels must be completed in time and you also have to watch out for enemy fire. The game's leaked prototype is known as Space Date.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "October 1, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Realtime Associates", "publishers": "FCI", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.19", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_of_Gas_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/22681\n"}
