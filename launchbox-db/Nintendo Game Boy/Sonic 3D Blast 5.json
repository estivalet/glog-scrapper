{"name": "Sonic 3D Blast 5", "overview": "Sonic 3D Blast 5 is basically an earlier version of Sonic Adventure 7 made in 1998. It is monochrome and its music is less developed. The intro, title screen and in-between level screen are taken from the 16-bit Sonic 3D: Flickies' Island. Every title card refers to the level as Green Hill Zone and only changes the act number. The levels are arranged in a better manner though: it goes from Green Hill Zone to the Base level to the city level and so on. According to some, this makes the game easier and seems to have been the intended order.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "1998", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Makon Soft", "publishers": "Makon Soft", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/115564\n"}
