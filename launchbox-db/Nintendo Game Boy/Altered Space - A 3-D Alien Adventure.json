Why, escape, of course, which is exactly what Humprey the astronaut sets out to do. He must make his way through the alien ship (over 250 rooms, all different, all dangerous) to reach an escape pod and return to Earth. Aliens, droids and tricky traps are waiting for him. He's counting on YOUR help! Altered space features a unique 3-D viewpoint and stereo sound for your adventuring enjoyment. You may never want to return to Earth.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "September 1, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Software Creations", "publishers": "Sony Imagesoft", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.05", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altered_Space", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jAb6uyyJcA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/17711\n"}
