{"name": "Taz-Mania 2", "overview": "Taz Mania 2 is the second Game Boy game based on the animated TV show. The player takes the role of Taz who has to free his family which was kidnapped by the two hunters Bull Gator and Axl. This is basically a standard platformer in which the player crosses the 16 levels, jumps over gaps and dodges enemies. However, the unique feature of the cartoon Taz was converted to the game: his ability to spin. This allows him to reach high acceleration and being invulnerable - but every second takes away a part of the associated energy bar. It can be refilled by picking up one of the power ups on the way. Every level has to be solved within a time limit and Taz loses one of four hearts when hit by an enemy or touching water.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "January 1, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Beam Software", "publishers": "THQ", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.6", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21145\n"}
