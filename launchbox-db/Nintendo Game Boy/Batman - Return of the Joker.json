{"name": "Batman: Return of the Joker", "overview": "THE JOKER IS BACK. AND HE'S THE ONLY ONE SMILING. The seedy underworld is crawling with criminals. Even worse - THE JOKER is back on top of 'en all! Law and order means nothing... Until now. Because BATMAN is here - and the action is hotter than ever! Extra-flexible dual scrolling. Pulse quickening music. And supersharp graphics! And this time, BATMAN hits fast and hard. Running, swinging and leaping to attack! And striking at the heart of THE JOKER. The CAPED CRUSADER has a totally new arsenal at his command: Batarang and Grappling Hooks. He can climb walls. Or beat his enemies bare-handed with a powerful punch! BATMAN has got to use all of his power. Because this world is a very dark place, and you never know where THE JOKER is hiding!", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "March 28, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sunsoft", "publishers": "Sunsoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.26", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman:_Return_of_the_Joker", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXiFFiXPURw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/17727\n"}
