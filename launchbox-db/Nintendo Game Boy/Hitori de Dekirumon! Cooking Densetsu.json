{"name": "Hitori de Dekirumon! Cooking Densetsu", "overview": "Cooking Densetsu is a cooking based RPG for the GameBoy. It's a short and simple game with a fun premise. Battles are done quiz-style, so if you don't speak Japanese you will struggle with that aspect a bit. However, you can still stumble through the game even if you do poorly in the battles, especially with some tips you can pick up from this guide. The overall difficulty is very low, especially since some of your recipes (which are used like spells in this game) will basically give you infinite HP, and some battle options will tell you the correct answers to the quiz questions. Mai is cooking in the kitchen with her friends Yajama and Ojama when she receives a letter from a demon telling her that he has kidnapped her brother. Mai must explore eight different food-themed worlds and rescue eight characters in order to gain the ability to enter the demon king's castle and rescue her brother.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "December 18, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jorudan", "publishers": "Vap", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d_iuhTNjt4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/117070\n"}
