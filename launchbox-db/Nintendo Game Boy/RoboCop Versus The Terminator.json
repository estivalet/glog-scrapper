As Robocop, you must travel across time into a bloody future ruled by the mechanical forces of Skynet. You'll face attack from every angle, every moment. An unwavering army of Terminators, robotic dogs, spiders, Endoskeletons and a relentless arsenal of automated weapons await you in this veritable hell on earth. To destroy this enemy, free its hostages and finally pierce the dark heart of a killer computer. It will take something more powerful than plasma rifles and laser guns: the human mind that still burns within you.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "August 1, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Unexpected Development", "publishers": "Interplay", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.3", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RoboCop_Versus_The_Terminator", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21080\n"}
