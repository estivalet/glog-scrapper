{"name": "Quarth", "overview": "Warning! QUARTH is the blockbuster puzzle challenge guaranteed to knock your socks and your block off at a maddening, mind-numbing pace. With a mortifying rain of bionic block patterns descending upon you, you race back and forth in your powerful Blockbuster ship obliterating the blocks before they blow you to kingdom come. Your incentive to stay alive is the points you rake in for every block you wipe out. And if you chalk up enough points to qualify, you'll charge into bonus games where it's you against the clock and the unstoppable blocks of QUARTH. So, ace, if you think you've got the steady hands of a brain surgeon, the sharp eye of an eagle, and the steely nerves of a Hollywood stuntman, power up QUARTH. And see if you can outlast the blockbusting action!", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "March 16, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Ultra Games", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.44", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarth", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21072\n"}
