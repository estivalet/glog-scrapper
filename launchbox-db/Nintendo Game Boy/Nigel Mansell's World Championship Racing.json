{"name": "Nigel Mansell's World Championship Racing", "overview": "Hold onto your engines and pour on the coal as you hit the track with the greatest name in World Championship racing, Nigel Mansell. You're in control. You've got the machine. But can you handle it? Try rough weather, a mean track and competition that won't quit.

And don't forget your crash helmet!", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "August 1, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gremlin Graphics Software", "publishers": "GameTek", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.55", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Mansell%27s_World_Championship_Racing", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEjTfAzewkM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/20984\n"}
