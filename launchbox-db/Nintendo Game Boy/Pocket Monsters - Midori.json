{"name": "Pocket Monsters: Midori", "overview": "Red and Green begin the Pok\u00e9mon series in the region of Kanto, where players play the role of Red, an eleven-year-old boy who has just started his journey as a Pok\u00e9mon Trainer from Pallet Town, on the same day as his Blue, who is Red's rival and the grandson of the local authority on Pok\u00e9mon, Professor Oak. Oak lets the two boys choose a starter Pok\u00e9mon, a choice of the Grass-type Bulbasaur, the Fire-type Charmander, or the Water-type Squirtle (and with the player's rival choosing the Pok\u00e9mon that has a type advantage over the player's Pok\u00e9mon). Oak also gives them a Pok\u00e9dex and asks them to catch all the Pok\u00e9mon in the region.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "April 27, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Game Freak Inc.", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.09", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r8EYO6Apnw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/128952\n"}
