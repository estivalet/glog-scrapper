{"name": "Tiny Toon Adventures: Wacky Sports", "overview": "The stars of the Tiny Toon Adventures animated series are the contestents in this multi-sport challenge. This title consists of a series of mini-games based loosely on popular sports. Playing as either Babs or Buster Bunny, you will participate in the following sports: Baseball, American Football, Tennis, Soccer, Basketball, and Mini-Golf. In each of the contests, success is based on quick reactions and good timing. Two players can play, but only alternating, not simultaneously. In addition to the sports games, there are two carnival games: A shooting gallery, and a catch-the-falling-object game.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "January 1, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.69", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/20606\n"}
