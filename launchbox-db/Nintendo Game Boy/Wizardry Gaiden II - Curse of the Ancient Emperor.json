{"name": "Wizardry Gaiden II: Curse of the Ancient Emperor", "overview": "Wizardry Gaiden II is the second in the Japan-exclusive Wizardry Gaiden series. The scenario was written by the Japanese author Benny Matsuyama, and is not based on any Wizardry game developed by Sir-tech. Developed by ASCII, the same company that created console versions of other Wizardry games, Wizardry Gaiden II shares many similarities to other console entries in the series in style. The game takes place in the city of Al-Marl, an oasis haven in the eastern desert. Workers in the city have been working tirelessly to uncover the mystery of nearby ruins, but to no avail. Near-daily cave-ins have killed or stranded many, and the labyrinth's mysteries only seem to deepen. It isn't until a warning carved into a metal plate is discovered that the people of Al-Marl realize the great evil they have awoken: their city was built upon the grave of the ancient sorcerer-emperor Halgith.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "December 26, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "ASCII Corporation", "publishers": "ASCII Corporation", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.92", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73930\n"}
