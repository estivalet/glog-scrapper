{"name": "Baby T-Rex", "overview": "Sethron has kidnapped your young lady and taken her to his castle for experiments. You grab your skateboard and follow him to set her free. But the way to the castle is filled with obstacles and creatures who Sethron has turned to the path of evil. Baby T-Rex is a very traditional platform game where you run and jump to get to the end of the stage. There are a total of 4 \"worlds\", each with 3 stages and a final boss stage. The game play is fast paced, with slides and skateboards passages for added speed. You can find stones and bowling balls to throw at the enemies. There are also power-ups to replenish health, obtain extra lives and gain invincibility. This game was used as a base for three other games, We're Back: A Dinosaur's Story, Bamse, and Agro Soar. Only vital elements such as the main character sprites and background story were changed, otherwise the games are identical.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Beam Software", "publishers": "Laser Beam Entertainment", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.69", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_Rex", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbUAlvjqy9I", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/28094\n"}
