{"name": "Quartet", "overview": "Quartet is a simple but addictive puzzle game where you assemble pieces into faces and score points. Don't be too slow, or you will lose! This is the Game Boy version of the original Quartet game by Photon Storm. The game is designed for the original monochrome Game Boy, but also to take advantage of later models with color displays. So if you run it on a GBC, GBA or even SGB you get a glorious full color experience.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "January 8, 2021", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "", "developers": "Mackerel Interactive", "publishers": "itch.io", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWzubHoYVsw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/156923\n"}
