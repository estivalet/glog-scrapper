{"name": "Pinball Mania", "overview": "After the success of Pinball Dreams, Pinball Fantasies and Pinball Illusions, publisher 21st Century Entertainment decided to let Spidersoft Limited develop a fourth game--Pinball Mania. Where the previous games excelled in ball simulation, a lot of people felt that Pinball Mania had very lacking ball physics, making controlled shots difficult to accomplish. A Game Boy port was also released which was only released in the UK.", "platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "release_date": "January 1, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Spidersoft", "publishers": "21st Century Entertainment Ltd.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA5QdZbgo0E", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/28681\n"}
