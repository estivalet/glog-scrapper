{"name": "Alfapet", "overview": "Alfapet is a Swedish word puzzle similar to Scrabble. Like in Scrabble players make words from randomly received letters and place them on the playing board. Words are worth points and each letter has its own value. The value of each letter is different from Scrabble and also the board is different with harmful tiles and quadruple modifiers. Tiles with arrows or stop symbols allow you to respectively lay words in a corner and behind other words without using their letters. The game uses a Swedish dictionary for words and can be played with up to four players.", "platform": "Philips CD-i", "release_date": "January 1, 1993", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Adatek", "publishers": "Philips Interactive Media", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/22320\n"}
