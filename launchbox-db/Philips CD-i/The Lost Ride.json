{"name": "The Lost Ride", "overview": "The Lost Ride is a rail shooter game where you are literally on rails. The player is put inside a futuristic roller coaster and has to shoot anything that might get in his way. The game comes with three different themes for its levels: Mine World, Aqua World and Future World. Each world has different seamless prerendered 3D backgrounds that feature as backdrops for the shooting action. At the end of each stage a Boss creature has to be killed, which will unlock a bonus ride. These random generated tracks are maze-like and require you to choose a direction at various points. They are presented in surround sound so they really feel like being inside a roller coaster.", "platform": "Philips CD-i", "release_date": "January 1, 1998", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Formula", "publishers": "Philips Interactive Media", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/22434\n"}
