{"name": "Defender of the Crown", "overview": "Strategy is vital in this chivalrous charade, and smarts will protect your hide better than armor as you command the role of a brave Saxon knight destined to avenge King Richard's murder. To reclaim the crown and conquer the heart of a beautiful maiden, you must outwit and outmaneuver hordes of medieval marauders. Read maps, plan raids, even team with Robin Hood, then plunder enemy strongholds, dueling for gold needed to build an army of mercenary vassals. You'll also need to stash cash for catapults that launch boulders, fire and disease into formidable fortresses. So wise up and rise up to this unique challenge where leadership is as important as swordsmanship. For when you've survived this strategic adventure, complete with daring jousts and courageous castle sieges, you won't be sorry - you'll be king!", "platform": "Philips CD-i", "release_date": "January 1, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Philips Interactive Media", "publishers": "Philips Interactive Media", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/22345\n"}
