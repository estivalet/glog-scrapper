{"name": "Face Kitchen", "overview": "Face Kitchen allows players to cook up faces. In Uby the French chef's kitchen players will find an abundance of ears, noses, mouths and facial accessories in the cupboards and refrigerator. Uby will mix up whatever you choose to create a new face. There are thousands of different faces that can be made. Each face sings a song, tells a tale, cracks a joke or tells a tale after being baked in the oven. Face Kitchen is meant for children but can be enjoyed by people of all ages.", "platform": "Philips CD-i", "release_date": "", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Philips Freeland Studios", "publishers": "Philips Interactive Media, Inc.", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/89192\n"}
