{"name": "ABC Sports Presents: Power Hitter", "overview": "ABC Sports Presents: Power Hitter is a baseball game for the CD-i. The game only lets you bat, the rest of the game is taken care of by the AI. Before batting you are shown screens in which you have to select batter strategies and guess the type of pitch. After you are presented with a first-person view from the batter and you have to time your swing right. When you hit the rest of the action is shown through video clips from an actual match. The game has no team licenses so all the teams are fictional. The game features commentary audio. The player doesn't play for a specific team, so either a single player bats for both teams or two players can alternate between the teams. The AI cannot take on the role of the batter.", "platform": "Philips CD-i", "release_date": "January 1, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Fathom Pictures", "publishers": "Philips Interactive Media", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/22411\n"}
