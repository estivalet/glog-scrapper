{"name": "Accelerator", "overview": "Accelerator is a 2D top down action racing game. The cars in the game feature weapons so while racing the player not only has to focus on the road but also has to dodge enemy bullets. When a car gets hit it is disabled for a couple of seconds. When this happens a lot the car explodes and the race is over for that participant. When the player performs well he can buy weapons himself and improve his driving skills. The player can choose between 8 different drivers to play with, each of them has its own abilities such as traction, acceleration, speed and armour. The game features 10 different tracks to race on.", "platform": "Philips CD-i", "release_date": "January 1, 1997", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "SPC Vision", "publishers": "Philips Interactive Media", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/22319\n"}
