{"name": "World Cup Golf: Hyatt Dorado Beach", "overview": "World Cup Golf takes the player to Puerto Rico's own Hyatt Dorado Beach Golf Course as they can choose from a bevy of fictional golfers or create their own in 18 rounds of golf. There are 15 types of tournaments to choose from including skins, medal and stableford to name a few. Players can also practice their swing on the driving range. Players can also customize weather conditions as well as choose from a plethora of camera shots including the \"Ball Cam\" that follows the ball to its location.
