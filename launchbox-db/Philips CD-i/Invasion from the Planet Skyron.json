{"name": "Invasion from the Planet Skyron", "overview": "Monty Python's Invasion from the Planet Skyron is an \"interactive variety show\" for the CD-i. You guide a group called the Lost Boys through nine levels in which you have to find out for yourself what to do. Each level consists of a screen in typical Monty Python art style. Clicking on elements may or may not instigate an event which could be either positive or negative. Behind the Lost Boys walks a sheep that keeps the score which goes up or down whenever you do something. Levels are broken up by sketches from the show. With enough points it is also possible to buy new sketches. There are several mini games to be found in the game such as memory, \"guess who said it\" and \"guess the sketch\" in which additional points can be scored.", "platform": "Philips CD-i", "release_date": "January 1, 1995", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Daedalus", "publishers": "Philips Interactive Media", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/22370\n"}
