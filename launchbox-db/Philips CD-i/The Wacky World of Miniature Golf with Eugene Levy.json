{"name": "The Wacky World of Miniature Golf with Eugene Levy", "overview": "In The Wacky World of Miniature Golf, the player can pick from a bevy of cartoon golfers and compete in 18 holes of miniature putt-putt golf in a variety of cartoon fantasy settings such as Egypt, prehistoric times, Atlantis, a prison and many more. The gameplay is more of an interactive cartoon where the player chooses the direction they wish to hit the ball and pressing the action button. If the player has chosen correctly they will hit it successfully and be treated to a cutscene where the ball will avoid the various obstacles and landing in the hole. Choosing the wrong path, however, will have their ball destroyed by a variety of obstacles and force the player to retry again. A feature of the game is the voice acting talent of Eugene Levy who is most notable for his film appearances in the American Pie film series.", "platform": "Philips CD-i", "release_date": "January 1, 1993", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Philips Sidewalk Studio", "publishers": "Philips Interactive Media", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.88", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/22436\n"}
