{"name": "Uncover: Featuring Tatjana", "overview": "Uncover featuring Tatjana is a strategic action game featuring Croatian-Dutch model, actor and singer Tatjana Simi\u0107. The game is similar to the arcade game Qix. Play takes place on a rectangular playing field. The player has to draw lines in order to colour in parts of the field. An erratically moving enemy moves around the playing field, but can only harm the player when he's drawing lines. When the player is not drawing lines he can only move on the outer borders of the playing field. There are also enemies on these borders moving in clockwise or counterclockwise directions. When the player touches an enemy the player loses a life. Unlike the original where the player also loses a life when the erratic enemy touches an incomplete shape, he now chases the player along the line. Coloured in parts in this version of the game are parts of pictures of Tatjana.", "platform": "Philips CD-i", "release_date": "January 1, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "SPC Vision", "publishers": "Philips Interactive Media", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/22440\n"}
