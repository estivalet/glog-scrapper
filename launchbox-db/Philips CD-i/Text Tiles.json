{"name": "Text Tiles", "overview": "Text Tiles is a strategic puzzle game in which players have to spell words. Using a set of given letters the players have to form words, much like Scrabble. This is done on a 12x12 board. The letters can be used to either form a long word or multiple short words. Points are scored for each correct word. Letters are received one at a time and disappear again after a certain amount of time creating a time pressure for forming words. The player can see what his next letter is going to be so he can plan ahead. The game can be played with up to four players.", "platform": "Philips CD-i", "release_date": "January 1, 1992", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Capitol Disc Interactive", "publishers": "Philips Interactive Media", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/22428\n"}
