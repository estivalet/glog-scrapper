{"name": "Scotland Yard Interactive", "overview": "Scotland Yard Interactive is a digital version of the board game Scotland Yard by Ravensburger. Mr. X is London's most wanted criminal and it's up to the players to catch him. In the game each turn players try to chase down Mr. X. Players have tokens for use of taxis, buses and the tube. But when the tokens run out the funding for the hunt is up and Mr. X. goes free. Mr. X. receives all used tokens and thus it becomes easier for him to travel throughout the game. But as a clue to the other players he must show which token he uses each turn. Mr. X. has a limited number of black tokens which could stand for any means of transportation. At five specific times during the game, Mr. X. has to reveal his current position. The detectives win when they land on the same square as Mr. X. Mr. X. wins when all tokens are spend up. This digital conversion features photographs and digital animations of London. The game can be played with up to six players and both Mr. X. and the detectives can be A.I. controlled.", "platform": "Philips CD-i", "release_date": "January 1, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Audio Visuelle Medien", "publishers": "Philips Interactive Media", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/22416\n"}
