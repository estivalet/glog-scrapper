{"name": "Jeopardy!", "overview": "Another version of the many Jeopardy! games released, this edition features full-motion video and the actual voice of Alex Trebek, but only shows him in the opening sequence and in the final round. The gameplay is like that of the TV show; two rounds of play with six categories with a final round at the end. To answer the question the player must buzz in and put in the answer by using letters on the side of the screen. However, different from the other games is that there is no computer opponent to play against and Final Jeopardy doesn't have the answering system like the previous rounds. Instead it requires you to write it down using paper and a pen or pencil.", "platform": "Philips CD-i", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Philips Interactive Media", "publishers": "Philips Interactive Media", "genres": "Quiz", "max_players": "3", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/22372\n"}
