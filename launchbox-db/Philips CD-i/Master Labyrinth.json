{"name": "Master Labyrinth", "overview": "Master Labyrinth is a digital version of the 1991 board game of the same name by Ravensburger. The digital version plays just like the board game. Players alternate turns in which they can shift rows or columns of the game board, which represents the layout of the maze. Scattered around the maze are various magical components that have to be collected by the players. Cards determine which components need to be collected. The player who collects most components wins the game.", "platform": "Philips CD-i", "release_date": "January 1, 1994", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Audio Visuelle Medien", "publishers": "Philips Interactive Media", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/22392\n"}
