{"name": "NFL Instant Replay", "overview": "NFL Instant Replay doesn't have the player take control of either NFL players, owners or coaches, instead the player will get to play as the sometimes vilified NFL referee. The idea of Instant Replay is for the player to take on the role of the ref and make tough calls when they are shown an actual NFL clip and must determine what call to make such as touchdown, incomplete pass, etc. There are given four different choices and twenty seconds to make the correct call. If the player does well enough, they can then make it to the NFL playoffs and eventually referee the biggest game of the season, the Super Bowl. It features over 100 actual NFL clips, the voice talents of broadcasting legend Pat Summerall along with the official NFL rule book.", "platform": "Philips CD-i", "release_date": "January 1, 1995", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Philips Interactive Media", "publishers": "Philips Interactive Media", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/22404\n"}
