{"name": "International Tennis Open", "overview": "More of a simulation than an action game, with a multimedia showcase (the game's got thousands of mini-videos, voiceovers, etc.). You select one of 9 nations to represent and get to play singles against a variety of opponents (no doubles play) in either practice mode, quick match, or tournament. Practice is pretty self-explanatory, quick match allows you to select your opponent (among 4 fictional players) and the type of court (concrete, grass, clay). While on tournament mode you select a host city from around the world and start playing from the quarter-finals on. You view the action from a 3rd-person perspective and in-game graphics consist of 2-d rotoscoped-animated sprites.", "platform": "Philips CD-i", "release_date": "January 1, 1993", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Infogrames", "publishers": "Philips Interactive Media", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/22369\n"}
