If they do, the consequences will be disastrous. Your prototype ship has been developed and its name is \"Steel Machine\". You will have to find a way to destroy the main reactors of each battle cruiser, by destroying the main reactor the ship will destabilise causing the cruiser to blow up. The cruisers have lots of enemy defences to be destroyed. The game is a horizontal shoot'em-up based on the old Commodore 64 game Uridium by Andrew Braybrook. It is one of the first CDi game titles which fully uses the hardware. Controlling the Steel Machine is quite simple.", "platform": "Philips CD-i", "release_date": "January 1, 1993", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "SPC Vision", "publishers": "Philips Interactive Media", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/22422\n"}
