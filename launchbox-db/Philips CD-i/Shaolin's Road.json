{"name": "Shaolin's Road", "overview": "Shaolin's Road is a action adventure that takes place in medieval China. When Tsu Yu's father, a powerful warlord, is murdered and his sword stolen, Tsu Yu vows to avenge his father's murder. The player (as Tsu Yu) will have to learn Shaolin Kung Fu to do so. The player has to roam the land and speak with other Kung Fu heroes, who will most likely only scoff at the player. Occasionally they will send the player on a trial which comes in the form of a mini game, such as shooting a snake with a bow and arrow, engaging in Kung Fu fighting and karate, throwing stars, performing calligraphy and playing memory to learn Chinese symbols. Completing challenges changes the color of the player's belt and gives him more recognition with the other fighters allowing him to progress further. It also unlocks new pieces of the map you can use to travel to new areas.", "platform": "Philips CD-i", "release_date": "January 1, 1995", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Infogrames", "publishers": "Philips Interactive Media", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/22418\n"}
