{"name": "Lettergreep", "overview": "Lettergreep is a word puzzle game in which you have to make as many words as possible from given syllables. For each correct word the player gains a number of points, but he loses points when he constructs an incorrect word. More points are awarded for words using more syllables. Once the time limit is up the player can no longer make new words and his score is final. The game is in Dutch and thus only features Dutch words and syllables.", "platform": "Philips CD-i", "release_date": "January 1, 1996", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Wigant Interactive", "publishers": "Philips Interactive Media", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/22381\n"}
