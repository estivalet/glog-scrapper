{"name": "Lords of the Rising Sun", "overview": "Japan, 12th century. After your father has been murdered, you set out on a quest to become Shogun to restore the honor of your family. You'll have to defeat all your enemies - including your brother. Most of the time, you'll move your troops through the big map of Japan - as soon as something happens, you'll have to fight your enemies in action sequences, such as a Gauntlet-like fortress attack or defending against a Ninja assassin. If two troops collide, a battle might ensue in which you'll have to use all your strategical wits to guide your men to victory. In the CD-i version the informative sequences include life actor FMVs and voice acting as well as new background art.", "platform": "Philips CD-i", "release_date": "January 1, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Philips POV", "publishers": "Philips Interactive Media", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lords_of_the_Rising_Sun", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/22385\n"}
