{"name": "Tim & Bear at the Airport", "overview": "Unlike the first title in the series which didn't feature interaction (beyond choosing which of the two characters to follow), this second Tim & Beer title is fully interactive. Tim and his teddy bear are visiting their cousin Tina who lives far away. Because of this they have to go by plane. Of course it's not easy to navigate around an airport. Tim & Bear at the Airport is an interactive cartoon film in which the viewer watches Tim & Beer explore the airport and the airplane. Viewers can opt to let the cartoon roll, or at times interfere and tell Tim or Bear what to do by choosing from several preset options. This creates tiny differences in how the story progresses.", "platform": "Philips CD-i", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Valkieser Multi Media", "publishers": "Philips Media Benelux", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/144263\n"}
