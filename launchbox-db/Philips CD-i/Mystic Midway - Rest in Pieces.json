{"name": "Mystic Midway: Rest in Pieces", "overview": "Mystic Midway: Rest In Pieces is basically a shooting gallery with a B-movies/TV horror theme - complete with a demonic host called Dr. Dearth, zombies, and other spooky things that glow in the dark. Like a typical shooting gallery game, your goal is to move a gun across the screen, shooting skulls, bugs, ghosts, and other creeps that pop up at random intervals. You'll have a limited amount of time and ammunition to do this. Every time you hit a target, you score points. Shooting a target usually results in an animation and sound effect. In some stages, gravestones move across the bottom of the screen to block your shots. Each stage requires a certain number of points to complete and stages will get harder as you advance through the game.", "platform": "Philips CD-i", "release_date": "January 1, 1992", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Philips POV", "publishers": "Philips Interactive Media", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/22400\n"}
