The game's star, Sol Cutter, is a computer hacker and small-time data thief whose latest steal at the beginning of the game comes with a nasty sting. The Burn Cycle virus has been implanted in his head and has given him a two-hour realtime deadline to find a cure before his brain deteriorates completely. The player must guide Sol out of Softech and into the Televerse in order to find his cure. Various obstacles and games stand in his way, and there is the overarching realisation that Burn Cycle has been planted by someone with malicious intent.", "platform": "Philips CD-i", "release_date": "January 1, 1994", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Trip Media", "publishers": "Philips Interactive Media", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.06", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/22330\n"}
