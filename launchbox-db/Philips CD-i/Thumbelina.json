{"name": "Thumbelina", "overview": "Thumbelina is an interactive telling of the story by Hans Christian Andersen. It features video fragments and stills from the cartoon film by Don Bluth. As the story is told images are show in the background. Many of these images include activities. These activities include coloring, starting animations through clicking on hot-spots and simple puzzles like counting objects and moving shapes to the correct sockets with the cursor. Colored images start to animate once they are filled in. The whole story is divided into seven chapters, so that it is possible to skip to the activities you want to play, or continue the story at a different time.", "platform": "Philips CD-i", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Spice Multimedia", "publishers": "Philips Interactive Media International Ltd.", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/144261\n"}
