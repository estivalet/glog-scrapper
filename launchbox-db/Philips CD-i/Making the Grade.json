{"name": "Making the Grade", "overview": "Making the Grade is a simulation game that puts the player in the position of a general manager of BP (British Petroleum) that has been tasked to construct and run a chemical plant for a ten year period. In this serious game the player learns everything he needs to know about management through a series of interactive scenarios. The game is presented in Full Motion Video sequences and features a large cast of co-workers with each their own personalities. The game features three phases. In the startup phase the player chooses a building site and a general manager. In the second phase he has to construct the plant and in the final phase he goes into production and has to make a profit. If the player doesn't do very well he can be fired at any time, which means it's game over. There are three different difficulty levels. At the end of the ten years the player is awarded with a score. The score depends on three criteria: Profit, PR skills and environmental issues. Your final score could be sent to BP. For a while after release a prize of a 1000 British Pounds was awarded every three months to the player with the highest score.", "platform": "Philips CD-i", "release_date": "", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/22482\n"}
