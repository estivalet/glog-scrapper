{"name": "Clue", "overview": "Clue is a full-motion video adaptation of the popular board game of the same name. There are three storylines with four difficulty levels, each with a unique solution making it altogether twelve different mysteries: The Hodded Madonna, Happy Ever After and Deadly Patent. The movement system, where the player moves the cursor to a portion of the screen and clicks on it to move or turn to that direction is similar to the one found in the The 7th Guest. Inside the rooms the screen switches to a 360\u00ba panorama that can be scrolled by moving the cursor to its edges. Clicking on clocks starts a flashback video of what happened on the room before the crime was committed. Clicking on suspects brings up the interrogation screen, where they can be inquired about weapons, their alibis, etc. Clicking on secret passages transports the player to another room. Clicking on the bell calls the butler and the accusation menu, where the player chooses the weapon and the murderer. Afterwards, the butler informs if the player made the right choice. A notebook keeps track of all the information collected, and can be accessed at any time. Each of the four difficulty levels have a different number of accusations available (3 on the easiest level, 1 on the hardest one). In the easier levels the room positions are fixed, while in the tougher levels they are random. In each player's turn they can perform two moves, two actions or a action and a move. A move is defined by entering and leaving a room. A action is defined by examining items, interrogating suspects or watching a flashback.", "platform": "Philips CD-i", "release_date": "January 1, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "3T Productions Ltd.", "publishers": "Philips Interactive Media", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "6", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/22338\n"}
