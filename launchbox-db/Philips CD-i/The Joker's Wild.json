{"name": "The Joker's Wild", "overview": "The Joker's Wild! is a trivia game based on the 70-80s game show of the same name. The game is hosted by Wink Martindale. In the game players answer multiple choice questions stated by the host. Categories for the questions are determined by a giant slot machine with three wheels. Each wheel features five categories and a joker. Each round a player pulls the lever and picks one of the resulting categories. The joker counts as a wild card. When an answer is correctly given to a question the player receives a certain amount of money. If the category is shown on the slot machine two or three times (2 or 3 of a kind) the scores are multiplied. When a player answers incorrectly his opponent may give a shot at the question and steal the money. Unlike the original show this video game adaptation can be played with up to four players. Of course no money can be won with this video game, but there is a high score list that keeps track of all the best scores.", "platform": "Philips CD-i", "release_date": "January 1, 1993", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Accent Media Productions", "publishers": "Philips Interactive Media", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/22430\n"}
