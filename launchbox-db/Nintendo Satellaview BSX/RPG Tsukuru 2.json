{"name": "RPG Tsukuru 2", "overview": "RPG Tsukuru 2 is a Satellaview-compatible Slotted Cartridge game belonging to ASCII's Tsukuru series. The title of these games are portmanteau-word puns mixing the Japanese word tsukuru, which means \"make\" or \"create\", with tsuru, the Japanese transcription of the English word \"tool\". As the title suggests, this RPG creation tool is a sequel to the earlier RPG Tsukuru. Data broadcast for this slotted cartridge also included the earlier-released RPG Tsukuru - Super Dante.", "platform": "Nintendo Satellaview", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Nintendo", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/76783\n"}
