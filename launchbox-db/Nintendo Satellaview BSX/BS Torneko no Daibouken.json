{"name": "BS Torneko no Daibouken", "overview": "Based on teaser footage depicted in a 1990s Satellaview commercial, BS Torneko no Daibouken appears to be a Satellaview update to the original September 1993 Torneko no Daibouken: Fushigi no Dungeon for SFC, the earliest game in the Mystery Dungeon series. The game is also linked to the Dragon Quest Series as the character Torneko is the merchant from Dragon Warrior IV. Current fan speculation seems to support the idea that BS Torneko no Daibouken was most likely canceled prior to a Satellaview release.", "platform": "Nintendo Satellaview", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "", "developers": "Enix", "publishers": "", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/141409\n"}
