{"name": "BS Zelda Restoration Map 1", "overview": "BS Zelda: Restoration is a fan-made compilation of patches for BS Zelda no Densetsu which aims to restore the experience to be as close as possible to the original broadcast of the game for players using emulators. It merges three different patches: BsZelda Complete by Roto, the Upgrade Patch by Dreamer Nom and Zelda Legends' Restoration patch. Combined, these bring all four weeks into a single continuous game, playable in emulation with no breaks or waits between the originally-weekly chapters and all scheduled events working. The \"Restoration\" version will automatically switch between chapters after 57 minutes of play, much like the original broadcast worked. Additionally, the patches bring: - a full English translation of the in-game text (with an optional add-on for the audio play that was broadcast along with the game, in its original Japanese or in a fan-made English dub) - a fully working save feature with player name entry and saving including problematic items (Magic Shield, Sword and Bomb Bags) - music - a title screen - the original intro and end sequence - a choice between the original two playable characters, the mascot and the girl - display of the current week's objectives - fully working bosses - various crash and bug fixes", "platform": "Nintendo Satellaview", "release_date": "", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.81", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/81520\n"}
