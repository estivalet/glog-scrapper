{"name": "BS Zelda no Densetsu: Dai-3-wa", "overview": "BS Zelda no Densetsu is a Downloadable 4-part Soundlink game for the Satellaview that was broadcast in at least 5 distinct runs between August 6, 1995 and January 4, 1997. A program called BS Zelda no Asobikata was also broadcast in the half-hour prior to broadcasts of BS Zelda. This program seems to have been a radio tutorial teaching players how to play BS Zelda. BS Zelda no Densetsu was the first Satellaview game to use the SoundLink system, where data was streamed simultaneously during broadcast including an orchestrated soundtrack and a voiceover track.", "platform": "Nintendo Satellaview", "release_date": "August 23, 1995", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/140675\n"}
