{"name": "Bokujou Monogatari: Dai-1-wa", "overview": "BS Bokujou Monogatari is a Downloadable 4-part Soundlink game for the Satellaview that was broadcast in at least 2 runs between September 2, 1996 and November 30, 1996. The game is a life-simulation game and it comes as a pseudo-sequel to the earlier-broadcast (July 1996)/retail release Bokujou Monogatari commonly known internationally as \"Harvest Moon\"; this has given the series the fan-nickname \"BS Harvest Moon\" as a result. Together with the game (typically immediately before and after), 10-minute broadcasts of a related nature were released entitled BS Bokujou Monogatari Torisetsu (a digital instruction manual) and Bokujou Monogatari no Kekka (a score/results program).", "platform": "Nintendo Satellaview", "release_date": "September 2, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Pack-In Video", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Life Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/76744\n"}
