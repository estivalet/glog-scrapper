{"name": "Cock-A-Doodle-Doo", "overview": "Originally developed by a 17-year-old Nakanishi Byakuya (\u4e2d\u897f\u3000\u767d\u591c) in the retail version of Super Dante, Cock-A-Doodle-Do would go on to be the 10-million-yen winner of the first of the ACON Grand Prix competitions, which rewarded indie game developers. Based on what I can look up in terms of discussion of the game, Cock-A-Doodle-Do was a controversial win. You wouldn\u2019t really consider a prize-winning game to get C-grade reviews and all. It was criticized for being a Super Dante game and also probably for being a comedy. To be clear, this for a JRPG starring a chicken! Cock-A-Doodle-Do is about the misadventures of an alcoholic boy named Nicole (unfortunately for him), who recently lost all his fortune, and his last possession, a pet chicken named Pal. Pal fights animal poachers, befriends a cat and a fairy, and perhaps later on in the game does actual JRPG-like heroic deeds. All while Nicole, um, constantly runs to the pub.", "platform": "Nintendo Satellaview", "release_date": "April 4, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Super Dante", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://remonetized.org/view/-rpgsuper-dante-cock-a-doodle-doo-bs-satellaview-/tz7od", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/127128\n"}
