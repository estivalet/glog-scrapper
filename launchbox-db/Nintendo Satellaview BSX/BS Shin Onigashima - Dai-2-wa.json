{"name": "BS Shin Onigashima: Dai-2-wa", "overview": "A sequel to the Famicom Disk System game Famicom Mukashibanashi: Shin Onigashima, BS Shin Onigashima was released on September 29, 1996, for the Super Famicom's Satellaview unit. The game was broadcast via the St.GIGA BS Satellite, and was downloadable within the BS-X menu from the Broadcast Clubhouse. BS Shin Onigashima takes its plot from the original version of the game, but is mostly presented from the viewpoint of the three helpers who join the protagonists during the game (the dog, monkey and pheasant). In-game music was transmitted via radio, and Ittaisan, the game's narrator, appears in-between chapters to sum up the storyline via SoundLink. The character of Ittaisan was voiced by Ichiro Nagai. The Satellaview version was well received by fans. The Super Famicom version uses the same command menu gameplay implemented in the Disk System version, but the \"Change Character\" command was not included due to time constraints. Satellaview games were only broadcast during a limited time period, and using the command would complicate the game to an unnecessary degree. New tweaks by the developers were to include platform-style action scenes, and to set time limits for choosing certain commands.", "platform": "Nintendo Satellaview", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/140619\n"}
