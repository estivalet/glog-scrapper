{"name": "BS Super Mario USA: Power Challenge: Dai-1-kai", "overview": "BS Super Mario USA Power Challenge is an ura- or gaiden-version of Super Mario Bros. 2 for the Satellaview system featuring graphical enhancements similar to its Super Mario All-Stars version. While the underlying gameplay itself is largely similar, new and arranged content has been added. Being episodic, BS Super Mario USA was released on a weekly basis. These four episodes were premiered: Week 1 - \"We, the Super-Birdos!\" Week 2 - \"Tryclyde also surprises, Secrets of the Quicksand\" Week 3 - \"Fry Guy at the Sea of Ice\" Week 4 - \"Wart's Trap. Watch Out, Super Mario Bros.\" In each one, the player is sent to a different SMB2 \"World\". The goal is seemingly to collect the Gold Mario Statues located in each level, defeat the boss, and then find and beat Wart, who can be battled in any world when going down in any vase while the player is in Subspace. The player can select the levels in any order and return to the levels as often as desired until the \"episode\" ends at around 50 minutes on the clock.", "platform": "Nintendo Satellaview", "release_date": "March 31, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nintendo", "publishers": "St. GIGA", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.59", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros._2#BS_Super_Mario_USA_Power_Challenge", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/77129\n"}
