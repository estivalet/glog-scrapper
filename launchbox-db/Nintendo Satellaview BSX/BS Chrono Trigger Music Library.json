{"name": "BS Chrono Trigger Music Library", "overview": "BS Chrono Trigger: Music Library was released for the Satellaview in 1995. The game was developed by Squaresoft and published by Nintendo. Essentially, Music Library is an add-on to Chrono Trigger. It contains the game's entire soundtrack, which can be selected and played based on disc and track number. The music is played in something like a media player, where the player has control over stopping and playing the music (but not fast-forwarding or rewinding). All of the songs from Chrono Trigger are included in BS Chrono Trigger: Music Library. Many of them loop, however, making them longer than the versions in the original game. 1.
