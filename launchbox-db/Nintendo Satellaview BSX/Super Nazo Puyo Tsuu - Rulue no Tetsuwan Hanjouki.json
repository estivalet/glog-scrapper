{"name": "Super Nazo Puyo Tsuu: Rulue no Tetsuwan Hanjouki", "overview": "Super Nazo Puyo Tsuu: Rulue no Tetsuwan Hanjyouki (which shall henceforth be referred to as \"Super Nazo Puyo Tsuu (BS)\" to disambiguate it from the standard release of the same name) is a downloadable Satellaview demo to promote the Super Famicom cartridge release of the same name. While many Satellaview demos were simple final retail releases with DRM locks, Super Nazo Puyo Tsuu (BS) is modified from the original game for demonstration purposes. It features a new attract demo that features CG art with the words \"for Satellaview\" engraved on it as well as a screen with info about the game's release date and price. The JRPG campaign mode progresses for some point before finishing, and many areas are locked out. The other puzzle modes also lock out after some time of play.", "platform": "Nintendo Satellaview", "release_date": "June 28, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sTotHZvjw8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/132751\n"}
