{"name": "Cu-On-Pa BS Ban", "overview": "Cu-On-Pa BS Ban (\u300c\u30af\u30aa\u30f3\u30d1\uff22\uff33\u7248\u300d) is a Downloadable game for the Satellaview that was broadcast in at least 2 runs between June 29, 1997 and December 19, 1998. Cu-On-Pa is an original puzzle game. The player controls a three-dimensional cube that must destroy all the \"Life Panels\" on a level. To do so, the player must rotate the cube and roll over the colored squares on the transparent field. Panels come in a variety of colors and the main way to eliminate them is by having the color on the top of the cube match the color of the tile beneath. The other way is for more skilled players and comes in the form of \"Lightning Panels\", which are generated when panels are destroyed other than Life Panels. Destroy enough of them and the player will see more of them. If the player then destroys a life panel, all lightning panels of the same color will explode as well. Moreover, the explosion spreads and detonates other tiles in the vicinity, which can spread and create a chain reaction. The player is given a choice in how to rack up points, either by time bonuses, lightning chains, or both.", "platform": "Nintendo Satellaview", "release_date": "June 29, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "St. GIGA", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/127319\n"}
