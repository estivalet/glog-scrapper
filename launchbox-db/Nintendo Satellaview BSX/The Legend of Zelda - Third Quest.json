{"name": "The Legend of Zelda: Third Quest", "overview": "The Legend of Zelda: Third Quest was an expanded version of The Legend of Zelda that was released for the Satellaview add-on of the Snes/Sfc System in Japan. The gameplay was identical to its predecessor, but the maximum of Rupees was increased to 999 (rather than 255), the overworld was altered, and dungeons were completely different. This game was aired in two versions, Map 1 and Map 2. Map 1 is sometimes referred to as a \"Third Quest\", in reference to The Legend of Zelda's Second Quest, and Map 2 would therefore be a Fourth Quest.", "platform": "Nintendo Satellaview", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nintendo", "publishers": "", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLjuG2g3aAU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/122395\n"}
