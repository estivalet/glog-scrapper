One day the rainbow mysteriously broke apart, separating into shards that fell on the island. Eager to return the rainbow to its magnificent self, Hakkun sets out to retrieve the shards. In the retail version the land is divided into four islands named the \"Peaceful Islands\" but otherwise follows the same story.
