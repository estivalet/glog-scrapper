{"name": "Kirby no Omochabako: Ball Rally", "overview": "In Kirby's Toy Box - Ball Rally, the player's goal is to guide Kirby and King Dedede through an obstacle course. He/she can do this using proper timing and the A Button; when A is pressed, some green platforms extend while others retract. Spherical Kirbys are released from the top-most door one by one. They can't stop rolling, so the player must extend the right platforms to guide the Kirbys safely over spikes. As more Kirbys join the playing field, it becomes increasingly difficult to guide them all to the exit. The player scores points by getting a Kirby to the exit. There are 50 Kirbys and Dededes altogether.", "platform": "Nintendo Satellaview", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "HAL Laboratory, Inc.", "publishers": "Nintendo", "genres": "Party", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "https://kirby.fandom.com/wiki/Kirby%27s_Toy_Box", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGMnRTLtrAw&list=LL&index=2&t=95s&ab_channel=Cabbusses%27sRetroObscurities", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/140640\n"}
