{"name": "One-on-One Basketball", "overview": "You're out on a dream court for a hot game of One-on-One. You're the Bird. Or you're Dr. J. And that's the last decision you'll have much time to make. You can play against the computer of challenge a friend. Your capabilities -- and your opponent's -- will be just like those of All-Stars Larry Bird and Julius (Dr. J) Erving. The computer knows their shooting percentages (guarded and unguarded) and their pet shots. Your scoring ability will depend on your timing, how effectively you're being guarded, and where you're shooting from. Like the game of basketball itself, One-on-One rewards you for playing with your head as well as your hands. Master the joystick moves, sharpen your timing, hone your reflexes until you can handle the Pro level... and don't let the other guy out-think you.", "platform": "Atari 7800", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atari", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.32", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/20423"}
