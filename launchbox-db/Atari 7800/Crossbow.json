Your goal is his castle far, far, away.<br><br>Your friends are lightly armed, but you carry your trusty crossbow.  By shooting its swift arrows, you can save yourself and your companions from the dangerous attacks of the Evil Master's creatures -- scorpions, ants, pterodactyls, voracious plants, bats, snakes, and other horrible beings.<br><br>When you reach the castle, the Evil Master's expert archers await you, ready to test their aim with deadly arrows.  Inside the castle, a fierce dragon also waits, guarding the treasure with its fiery breath.<br><br>Few adventurers have dared to make the trek.
