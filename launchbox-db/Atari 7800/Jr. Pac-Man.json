I run faster than a speeding roller skate, ducking behind barriers, dodging those mean bullies. I can even race from one side of a playground to the other. That's a lot of ground to cover!<br><br><br><br>But I've got to play a lot harder than my folks to live up to the Pac-Man family name. That's why this is a whole new game!<br><br><br><br>Jr. Pac-Man is another classic arcade game faithfully brought to life on the Atari 7800 by programming wizard Bob DeCrescenzo.
