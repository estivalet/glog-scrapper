{"name": "Knight Guy in Low Res World: Castle Days", "overview": "Your pet has been kidnapped (petnapped?) by an evil dragon. Go to the depths of the evil castle and rescue your best friend! Are you brave enough?<br><br>Once you start the game, your objective is to break through multiple rooms plagued with all sorts of perils until you reach room 99, where the evil dragon keeps your pet captive.<br><br>You start the game with three lives, but you will increase that amount every time you find a potion. If you find all the potions, you will have a maximum of eight lives. Also, you will find hearts that recover your health, but these do not increase your max lives counter. Every time an enemy or an obstacle touches you, you will lose a life. If you fall through the bottom of the screen, you will also lose a life.<br><br>You will also have to race against time: you'll have to exit the castle with your pet in one hour or you'll be kiled by the castle curse. The challenge is not only to rescue your beloved pet, but also do so in the shortest time possible.<br><br>The best knights should be able to also find the four secrets hidden in the castle. In some rooms, avoiding the obstacles is enough to reach the exit to the next room.<br><br>But the evil dragon is not the only inhabitant of Evil Castle, so before you can face the final boss, you will have to face his minions: The Castle Guardians. These guardians will do everything in their power to foil your attempts to reach the dragon!<br><br>Do you have what it takes to conquer the evil guardians, find your pet, and escape the castle in time?
