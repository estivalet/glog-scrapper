{"name": "Gato", "overview": "In Gato, you play the commander of a United States submarine in the Pacific Ocean during World War II against Japanese warships. Gato is a 3D real-time submarine simulation game. Gameplay consists of missions where the primary directive is to navigate your submarine to track and intercept (multiple) enemy warships (patrol boats, destroyers, etc.) on the randomly created map and close in for the kill with torpedoes. Combat itself consists of a direct visual of enemy ships (via periscope) and firing torpedoes at the correct angle to ultimately sink the ship. Be warned that although you have the element of surprise, enemy ships can fire back! When all hell breaks loose, an identified submarine is a sitting duck to those Japanese guns. Be prepared to direct your damage control team to fix up your damaged submarine ASAP! The mission ends when you have successfully eliminated all targets in the map.", "platform": "Atari 7800", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atari", "publishers": "Atari", "genres": "Vehicle Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.6", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMA3eJ9n90Q", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/20470"}
