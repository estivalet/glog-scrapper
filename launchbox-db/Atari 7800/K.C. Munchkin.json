{"name": "K.C. Munchkin", "overview": "K.C. Munchkin is an Atari 7800 port of one of the better known games on the Odyssey 2 console. K.C. Munchkin is a maze game similar to Pac-Man, in which you must navigate your Munchkin through a maze to eat all twelve Munchies, all while evading the Munchers. If you eat the special Munchie (which flashes different colors), the Munchers turn purple, allowing you to eat them.<br><br><br><br>K.C. Munchkin was released for the Odyssey 2 a year before Atari was able to release Pac-Man for the 2600. However, Atari had the exclusive home console rights to Pac-Man and sued Philips to force them to cease production of K.C. Munchkin. Although Atari wasn't initially successful, they did ultimately win on appeal, and Philips was forced to halt sales of the game.", "platform": "Atari 7800", "release_date": "2014", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Robert DeCrescenzo", "publishers": "AtariAge", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75109"}
