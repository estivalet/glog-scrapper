{"name": "Scrapyard Dog", "overview": "Louie, the junkyard guy, was just settling down to his regular Sunday afternoon lunch: a foot long head-cheese sandwich with tons of mustard, six garlic pickles, a two-pound bag of potato chips and a diet soft drink. (The diet soft drink was because Louie was watching his weight -- nobody likes a fat junkyard guy.) The phone rang and Louie picked it up, even though his mouth was full. He listened a few moments, and then sprayed crumbs of bread and head cheese all over the office. A dastardly dognapper gang kidnapped his best pal Scraps, the infamous Scrapyard Dog! If Louie doesn't hand over the deed to the junkyard, Scraps is dog-gone!<br><br>Louie played along, and told the kidnappers he would bring the deed to the first checkpoint to receive further instructions. But it's un-American to knuckle under to kidnappers and terrorists, and Louie won't do it! He's going to go to the checkpoint and find out the location of the gang's headquarters, then he's going to rescue Scraps and rid the town of the puppy purloiners.<br><br>With a few useful items for weapons (mostly old cans), Louie sets out to save his buddy Scraps. Can Louie save his cruelly captured canine, or will little Scraps end up dog meat? Find out, and help Louie save his Scrapyard Dog!", "platform": "Atari 7800", "release_date": "January 1, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "BlueSky Software", "publishers": "Atari", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.61", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/20426"}
