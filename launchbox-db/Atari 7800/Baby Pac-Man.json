{"name": "Baby Pac-Man", "overview": "Baby Pac-Man is the first complete home port of the 1982 Bally / Midway Video and Pinball hybrid game. While there have been may hacks to existing Pac-Man games to include the mazes from this game, there was never an actual home port with the more aggressive AI for the monsters, pinball section (on screen), or the new rules for energizers / tunnel speed.<br><br>You must guide Baby Pac-Man through the multiple mazes, and avoid the most aggressive (downright nasty) monsters that ever existed in a Pac-Man game. Drop off the bottom of the maze to the pinball section, and you can earn energizers (you don't start with any), speed through the side tunnels to quickly outrun the monsters, and to advance the fruit level.<br><br>You can also earn an 'extra life' through the pinball section by lighting all of the middle arrows.<br><br>You have the added option of playing the pinball section only, the video section only, or the entire game as it existed in the arcades. There is also the option of using the more 'classic' monster AI (including no 'quick reversals') for slightly easier game play. It's the best of both worlds!", "platform": "Atari 7800", "release_date": "2019", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Robert DeCrescenzo", "publishers": "AtariAge", "genres": "", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X37NS8b0C0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/153864"}
