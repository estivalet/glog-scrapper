{"name": "Tank Command", "overview": "Tank Command is a vertically scrolling action game. You control a tank on a mission to capture the enemy flag as well as earn as many points as possible. To do this, you will need to blast your way through their defenses on three levels of increasing difficulty. Blocking your progress are enemy tanks, pillboxes, missiles, jeeps, infantry, huts, and more, all of which earn you points when destroyed. Your tank is equipped with a limited amount of fuel and ammo, however it can be replenished occasionally by collecting the bonus icons when they appear on the screen. If you can make it past all of the obstacles and capture the flag, then you win the game!", "platform": "Atari 7800", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Froggo Games Corporation", "publishers": "Froggo Games Corporation", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.71", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voZptLr4NZo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21751"}
