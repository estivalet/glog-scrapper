{"name": "Serpentine", "overview": "In an age when human beings have become an insignificant part of the landscape, mighty serpents rule the decaying corridors and pathways of our vanishing civilization. You have managed to tame several of the huge beasts to do your bidding, and now ride forth to rid the planet of their slithery cousins.<br><br>Your serpent is fast, but the evil serpents are big, cunning and hungry. You will need to outwit them to chomp them down to size. An occasional tasty frog added to your serpent's diet will help it grow large enough to take on your foe. But bad snakes need nourishment too, and if they get to the frogs before you do they become dangerously assertive.", "platform": "Atari 7800", "release_date": "2016", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "RevEng", "publishers": "AtariAge", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj5GidwcGSE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/153910"}
