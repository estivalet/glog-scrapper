{"name": "Pac-Man Collection", "overview": "Pac-Man Collection is a round-up of the various official (and some not so official) releases of one of the most popular games in history.

Within this game cartridge you will find:<br><br>Pac-Man (The Original!)<br><br>Puck Man (Same game, more difficult maze)<br><br>Hangly Man (Empty Mazes? Vertical Tunnels? Invisible Mazes?)<br><br>Ultra Pac-Man (6 New Mazes for a new variety)<br><br>Random Mazes* (You just never know which maze will appear next!)<br><br>Ms. Pac-Man (The second installment of the Pac-Family)<br><br>Ms. Pac-Attack (Same game, more challenging mazes)<br><br>Ms. Random Mazes* (Like Random Mazes above, but with the Ms. flavor)<br><br>* - denotes games that were not released as actual arcade games, officially or otherwise <br><br><br><br>Also included is the 'Plus' and 'Fast' variations of these games, which you can individually set on or off for each game. Plus Mode has the various effects when enabled:<br><br>Game Speed is increased<br><br>Bonus prizes are replaced with alternate items<br><br>Bonus prizes now have the same effect as an energizer, except the monsters turn invisible (they are worth double points this way!)<br><br>Eating a standard energizer doesn't always turn all four monsters blue...<br><br>Eating a standard energizer might make the maze and dots disappear for the duration of the energizer<br><br>Maze colors are different as an indicator of 'Plus' mode<br><br>'Plus' mode is the equivalent of the arcade game Pac-Man Plus. 'Fast' Mode increases the speed of the player only when enabled. In total, you have 24 game variations to choose from!", "platform": "Atari 7800", "release_date": "2006", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Robert DeCrescenzo", "publishers": "AtariAge", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.81", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75116"}
