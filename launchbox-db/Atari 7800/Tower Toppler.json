{"name": "Tower Toppler", "overview": "A serious problem is blocking attempts to colonize the otherwise life-compatible planet Nebulus: it's water is poisonous! The only way to return the water to its harmless, natural form is to destroy the eight enormous towers that maintain a mysterious, lethal hold over all forms of this valuable resource.<br> Spurred to action by the needs of your dangerously overpopulated home planet, you must attempt to conquer these alien-forsaken relics once and for all. But it won't be easy! You'll have to climb each tower all the way to the top in order to detonate its vulnerable spot. And, succeeding towers are more difficult to topple!<br> You'll need all your wits about you to avoid huge, crushing boulders, giant eyes, and indestructible mutant molecules! And watch out for those slippery stairs and disintegrating ledges. One false step and you'll plummet to the depths below!", "platform": "Atari 7800", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atari, Inc.", "publishers": "Atari, Inc.", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCs9bZ8VSM8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4654"}
