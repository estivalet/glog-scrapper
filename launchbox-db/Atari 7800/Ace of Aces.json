{"name": "Ace of Aces", "overview": "Ace of Aces puts you in the cockpit of the Mosquito, the maverick RAF fighter bomber of World War II. It's white-knuckle aerial combat simulation, combining the exhilaration of flight with the gut-wrenching pressure of enemy confrontation.<br>During World War II, Mosquitos downed 659 enemy aircraft and 500 V-1 Buzz Bombs. Your only allies are your wits, your weapons, and your radar. Are you equal to the challenge?<br>Down the Nazi bombers, sink the U-boats, outrun the V-1 Buzz Bombs and stop the enemy trains to release the POWs. Should you fly through a storm or around? Navigate carefully, consult your intelligence reports and maps to make a decision. Choose your weapons and fuel wisely--once you're on a mission there's no going back.<br>Select one mission or any combination. If you complete all four successfully--and make it back alive--you'll become the most distinguished flight veteran of World War II--the Ace of Aces!", "platform": "Atari 7800", "release_date": "June 1, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Artech", "publishers": "Atari", "genres": "Flight Simulator", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.81", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/20464"}
