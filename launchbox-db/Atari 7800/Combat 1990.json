{"name": "Combat 1990", "overview": "Combat 1990 plays homage to the classic Combat that was packed with millions of 2600 systems. Unlike the original Combat, this version offers both single and two player games (although the two player game is cooperative, as opposed to head-to-head). Each player starts with five tanks, and your goal is to destroy as many enemy tanks and saucers as possible. In addition to firing projectiles, your tank features a shield that will protect it from incoming attacks, although firing will disable the shield. You can drive over energy pods that will replenish your shield to 100% strength. <br><br>The game ends when you run out of tanks or five minutes has elapsed. At that time you'll receive bonus points for any remaining tanks and shield energy. <br><br>Combat 1990 was written for the Atari 7800 by Harry Dodgson and was submitted in a 7800 Homebrew contest sponsored by Staticgamer.com in 2005. Combat 1990 received second place in the contest.", "platform": "Atari 7800", "release_date": "2005", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Harry Dodgson", "publishers": "Video 61", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83197"}
