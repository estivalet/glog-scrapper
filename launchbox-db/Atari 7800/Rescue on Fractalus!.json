{"name": "Rescue on Fractalus!", "overview": "Jet through the cavernous canyons of Fractalus\u2122--in panormic realism. Your fellow pilots are waiting desperately for you. But so are the vicious Jaggi\u2122 aliens. You never know what's going to turn up--or where--until it happens...<br><br>In 2004 Curt Vendel of AtariMuseum.com uncovered several Atari 7800 prototypes, including the unreleased game Rescue on Fractalus. While the game is not complete, it is fairly far along, runs pretty smoothly, and can be played with the excellent MESS emulator. To start the game after firing it up, press \"R\" (Reset) in MESS. There is a glitch in the emulation right now with the rendering of your view outside the cockpit, but we expect this will be fixed in an upcoming release of MESS.", "platform": "Atari 7800", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21748"}
