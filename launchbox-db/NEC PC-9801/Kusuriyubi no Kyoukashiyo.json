{"altername_name": ["Kusuryubi no Kyookashiyoo"], "name": "Kusuriyubi no Kyoukashiyo", "overview": "Toshio is an eighteen-year-old young man who has attended a special school, and now has quite a bit of free time on his hands. He has been raised by his single father, and has enjoyed a careless life in a wealthy environment. Now, his thoughts are directed at his pretty ex-schoolmates. Not everything is as simple as it may seem - Toshio has to plan his moves carefully, otherwise he might fail in his amorous endeavors. Kusuriyubi no Ky\u014dkasho is essentially a visual novel; though it offers somewhat more choices than most other games of the type, it does not feature a permanent command menu. The player is usually prompted to choose between two or more available actions for the protagonist. These decisions may trigger certain events, alter the course of the storyline, or lead to a premature end of the game.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "April 5, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Active Software", "publishers": "Active Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137402-kusuriyubi-no-kyoukashiyo\n"}
