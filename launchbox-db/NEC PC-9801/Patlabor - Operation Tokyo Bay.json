{"altername_name": ["Kidou Keisatsu Patlabor: Operation Tokyo Bay"], "name": "Patlabor: Operation Tokyo Bay", "overview": "Patlabor: Operation Tokyo Bay is a real-time city-building simulation somewhat similar to SimCity series. The setting is taken from the Patlabor anime series, more specifically Patlabor: The Movie (1989). The story begins in 1998, when Tokyo Bay undergoes a drastic re-development, which includes the construction of artificial islands under the codename \"Babylon Project\". The player is entrusted with the task of designing the infrastructure of the city. Four types of pre-made transportation networks can be selected before the actual construction begins. The player is also prompted to position electricity, water, and other resources on the map before getting started. The game then proceeds in real time, with natural disasters such as earthquakes, typhoons, etc. frequently disrupting the player's progress. The player assigns team to work on construction projects and also invests money in the development. It is possible to build hotels, schools, parks, factories, and other types of urban scenery. The key plot element of the movie - the series' trademark giant mechas known as Labors mysteriously going rogue - is also used for gameplay purposes. Hostile Labors would randomly assault the team, and the player has to decide whether to attack or negotiate with them. Defeated or otherwise convinced Labors then join the team and affect the city's future development.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "February 25, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Emotion", "publishers": "Banpresto", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgXIpns4yDM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/127795-patlabor-operation-tokyo-bay\n"}
