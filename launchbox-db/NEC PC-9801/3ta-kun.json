{"altername_name": [], "name": "3ta-kun", "overview": "A nameless otaku (which roughly corresponds to the English geek, albeit with a focused \"nerdiness\" in all things anime) encounters an aggressively-looking Santa Claus, who offers to test his knowledge; if he succeeds, he can have his way with a few magically summoned beautiful girls... Santa-kun is a quiz simulation. Santa asks a question, and the player must choose the correct answer among the three available ones. The game consists of several \"matches\"; in the beginning of each, a fully dressed young girl is introduced. A match consists of three rounds (25 questions all together); after each round, the girl removes part of her clothing. Upon successful completion of a match, the girl is shown fully naked. The questions revolve (with a few exceptions) around video games and computer technology.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "July 19, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Active Software", "publishers": "Active Software", "genres": "Quiz", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.72", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/139239-3ta-kun\n"}
