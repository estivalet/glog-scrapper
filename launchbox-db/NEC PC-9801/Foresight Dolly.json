{"altername_name": [], "name": "Foresight Dolly", "overview": "Dolly is an android who escaped from the factory under mysterious circumstances. She was captured by its creators, but eventually managed to flee with the help of the science technician Amy. The two girls suddenly find themselves teleported to a fantasy world, and must find a way to return home. Foresight Dolly is a role-playing game that can be described as \"light\". The player controls Dolly who travels through interconnected areas, most of which consisting of dungeon-like passages. Dolly can equip a weapon and one item as armor. Enemies are visible on screen, and contact with them triggers a turn-based battle, where Dolly can attack physically or use special techniques. Experience and money are gained from combat. The game also has a day and night cycle; Dolly and Amy would automatically go to sleep late in the evening, restoring Dolly's hit points.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "November 11, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Right Stuff", "publishers": "Right Stuff", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137197-foresight-dolly\n"}
