{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gensei Kitan: Disc Saga III", "overview": "Gensei Kitan: Disc Saga III is set in a fantasy world with both medieval and steam-punk elements. The player controls an enthusiastic fighter named Smash from the Dog Tribe. He takes the train to return to his home town after a prolonged absence. The Elder was kidnapped by a mysterious group of demons. After having rescued him, Smash learns about a secret treasure that is protected by various animal Tribes and is now in a grave danger. On his journey Smash hooks up with the lovely messenger of the Fox Tribe, the female guitarist Kiri, and other companions who will help him defeat the evil. Despite the third number in its title, which it shares with the episodic Disc Saga games (created by the same company), it has little to with them plot- or gameplay-wise. It is closer to traditional Japanese RPGs of the time, having characters with developed personalities, a lot of dialogue, etc. The player navigates Smash and his friends through top-down locations, talking to people and fighting randomly appearing enemies in hostile areas. The turn-based battles are viewed from a side perspective. Characters can execute various \"techniques\", which deplete TP (technique points), or magic spells.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "January 4, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Compile", "publishers": "Compile", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/kXw8k0bVLJ8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137226-gensei-kitan-disc-saga-iii\n"}
