{"altername_name": [], "name": "Libros de Chilam Balam", "overview": "Chilam Balam is a collection of Mayan books, containing scientific information as well as prophecies and esoteric lore. The story of the game eventually reveals a connection to these mysterious books, but it begins in a more prosaic way. Set in the American Wild West (with fictional locations), it follows the story of Wilfred R. Anderson, or simply Fred. His father left him a gift, a seemingly ordinary gun. But one day, Fred's sweetheart Christina is kidnapped; the ransom note proposes a meeting in a saloon in another town, and demands that gun in exchange for Christina's freedom. Fred and his friend Max and Edward head to the other town - and that is just the beginning of a very long journey, that will force the young men to face grave dangers and unspeakable supernatural forces. The stand-out feature of Libros de Chilam Balam is its unusual Wild West setting. In other aspects, the game plays like a typical Japanese RPG, particularly similar to Phantasy Star series (the battles with abstract backgrounds and over-the-head view of the characters remind of Phantasy Star II). Characters can equip guns, but the way weapons are handled is no different from a standard Japanese RPG. The heroes roam the top-down world and fight random monsters in turn-based combat; there are even magic spells of various kinds - healing, supporting, and offensive. As in most Japanese RPGs, leveling up is automatic.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "November 7, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Right Stuff", "publishers": "Right Stuff", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133368-libros-de-chilam-balam\n"}
