{"altername_name": [], "name": "Nectaris", "overview": "Nectaris / Military Madness is a futuristic turn-based strategy war game. The year is 2089 and the setting is Earth\u2019s moon, which yields many important resources. While the governments of Earth bicker over their staked claims on the moon, the evil Axis Empire launches a lunar military campaign and takes over the moon, using its factories to produce advanced weaponry, the most devastating of which is the SAM (Supreme Atomic Missile). As commander of the Allied forces, it is the player\u2019s responsibility to lead what\u2019s left of the Allied armies in a desperate offensive against the Axis Empire on the lunar surface before they can use the SAM to destroy Earth. There are 32 maps (2 different campaigns with 16 maps each) to play through. In each map, the player must strategically defeat the outnumbering Axis forces either by destroying all enemy units or capturing the enemy base camp. There are many different units that both sides utilize - infantry, tanks, aircraft, artillery, and a few others that have specialized functions. Gameplay consists of moving units into positions that will gain the best advantage to attack the enemy, capitalizing on many factors, which include battle experience, terrain, support tactics, and - sometimes - pure luck.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "September 17, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "SystemSoft", "publishers": "SystemSoft", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/139265-nectaris\n"}
