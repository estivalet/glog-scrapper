{"altername_name": ["Mujintoo Monogatari 2"], "name": "Mujintou Monogatari 2", "overview": "Mujint\u014d Monogatari 2 is a follow-up to Mujint\u014d Monogatari. Like its predecessor, it simulates survival of a group of people on a deserted island - this time, following a ship accident. The basic gameplay is very similar to that of the previous game. The player has to make schedules for the survivors, sending teams to procure necessary supplies such as water, food, light sources, building materials, etc. Only a small part of the island is accessible in the beginning: the player gradually explores it by arranging expeditions. It is possible to manage up to three parties of people, giving each an assignment, which unfolds automatically as the player chooses to complete a day. The survivors' attributes will change depending on the activities chosen by the player. The game is significantly more story-driven than the first installment. Each of the survivors has his or her own personality, attributes, and unique dialogue lines. Team members will comment on the occurrences, depending on the party formation the player chooses.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "May 26, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mediamuse", "publishers": "KSS", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137483-mujintou-monogatari-2\n"}
