When he enters, he encounters a strange, puppet-like woman who calls herself Heine. She shows the young man a puppet that looks like a beautiful young woman, and asks him to touch it. Immediately afterwards, the hero finds himself in a hospital, suffering from amnesia and facing an unknown woman who looks exactly like the puppet. Now he has to find out the truth behind this strange story, and separate dream from reality. Mirror is a visual novel. Most of the game is composed of text accompanied by still pictures. The game sometimes prompts the player to choose an action or a conversation line out of two or more available ones. Many of these choices, however, do not have a lasting impact on the development of the story. The game contains a few scenes with mild nudity.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "December 9, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Studio Twinkle", "publishers": "Studio Twinkle", "genres": "Visual Novel", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147775-mirror\n"}
