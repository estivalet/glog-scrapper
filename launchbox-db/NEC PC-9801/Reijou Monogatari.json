{"altername_name": [], "name": "Reijou Monogatari", "overview": "Three sisters of the Saij\u014d family - Michie, Saki, and Erika - lived together peacefully in a quiet house. Their parents have died but left them a very large fortune, which evoked jealousy in people surrounding them. On Michie's twentieth birthday their greedy and corrupt uncle, who recently lost a vast amount of money due to failed business transactions, sent his goons to extort from the young women the fortune they rightfully possessed. Reij\u014d Monogatari has very little interaction, reducing it to occasional scenes where the player has three choices to make. Most of these lead to dead ends, while others open new choices and trigger the next scene. There are no branches in the story, but the player can choose to go through the scenario from the point of view of either of the sisters. The game mainly consists of pornographic scenes, most involving rape and torture. Some of these scenes are animated.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "April 28, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Inter Heart", "publishers": "Inter Heart", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137564-reijou-monogatari\n"}
