{"altername_name": ["Immoral Study 3"], "name": "Immoral Study: Scenario 3: Asakura Manami", "overview": "The third scenario of Immoral Study describes yet another somewhat unusual teaching experience in the life of Mr. Hitosuji, a young and handsome private tutor. This time, the victim... err... pupil is Asakura Manami, a shy, quiet girl who lives together with her mother. Hitosuji is supposed to make Manami a better student - but instead he chooses to participate in S&M relationship between mother and daughter... The third part has the same gameplay as the two previous titles - meaning hardly no gameplay at all. The game is completely linear, there is only one way from start to finish, and the only interaction consists of repeatedly choosing menu options until an event is triggered. Like its two predecessors, Scenario 3 also contains animated scenes.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "November 22, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Scoop Software Productions", "publishers": "Scoop Software Productions", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137320-immoral-study-scenario-3-asakura-manami\n"}
