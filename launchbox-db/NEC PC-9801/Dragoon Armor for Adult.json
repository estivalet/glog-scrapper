{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dragoon Armor for Adult", "overview": "The lovely princess was abducted by a mysterious giant black bird. The bird carried the prisoner to a tower on the lake shore. Who would be brave enough to venture into the tower and to rescue the princess? Only the courageous knight Landis, aided by the Goddess herself! Dragoon Armor for Adult is a very basic first-person dungeon crawler, with vector graphics (like in early Wizardry games), but without party members; Landis explores the similarly-looking mazes (no auto-map feature) all by himself, fighting randomly appearing enemies in simple turn-based combat. It is possible to buy weapons, armor, and items outside, but there are no other locations to access beside the tower. Event cut-scenes may feature nudity, but no \"hardcore\" sexual situations.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "June 8, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "FairyTale", "publishers": "FairyTale", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137132-dragoon-armor-for-adult\n"}
