He and his siblings (twin sisters) possess supernatural abilities: telekinesis, teleportation, time shift, etc. The tradition of their family forbids them to use these powers publicly. Whenever they fail to hide their unique nature, the whole family has to move.

The interaction is performed by selecting verb/object combinations from an omnipresent menu. There are no puzzles, but the list of verbs include (beside the usual \"Examine\", \"Talk\", and \"Move\") also the commands \"Take\" and \"Use\" (an item). These are sometimes required to execute in order to trigger the next event of the story.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Micro Cabin", "publishers": "Micro Cabin", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/132085-kimagure-orange-road-natsu-no-mirage\n"}
