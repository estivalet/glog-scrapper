{"altername_name": ["Kyohaku"], "name": "Kyouhaku", "overview": "Asuka Akiyama has been an ordinary, innocent Japanese schoolgirl, until a fateful moment changed her life forever. One day, after talking to a nice-looking boy named Ryosuke, Asuka came home and masturbated in the shower. The next day, she found out that someone has taken photos of her during that intimate moment. From that point on, Asuka becomes involved in a violent chain of events. Will she be able to retain her purity and be together with Ryosuke, or put in danger everyone she cares for and become a willing sex slave? Ky\u014dhaku is a visual novel; even through the game has a rudimentary command menu (with \"Look\" and \"Talk\" commands), it appears infrequently, and doesn't allow much interaction. The gameplay involves making choices for Asuka, branching the storyline and leading the game towards one of the many possible endings, only few of which can be classified as \"happy\".", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "April 27, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "AIL", "publishers": "AIL", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137403-kyouhaku\n"}
