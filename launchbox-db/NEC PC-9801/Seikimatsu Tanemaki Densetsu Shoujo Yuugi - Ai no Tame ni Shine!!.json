At the beginning of the 1990s more than 60% of men lost \"male function\", and women got frustrated with more and more incidents of men raped by women to occur. By 2000 the civilization was about to ruin due to women violence. Kentaro's sister Yuriko got kidnapped mysterious \"Lolita invaders\" squadron. Kentaro tried to stop them but got defeated by their captain Yui. A strange old man instructs him how to get to their city base, but now the encounter will be on his terms. One of the biggest works of Great - an erotic parody on many big hit works of the time including Fist of the North Star, Sukeban Deka, The Super Dimension Fortress Macross and Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind. It's a good thing people of the 1980s were ignorant about the copyright! The scenario is basically a single road, but during the command selection battles it's important not to use certain commands in the first half of the battle. The game is just too fun to play and it's hookable just fine. That's a masterpiece game despite its disturbing nature at times.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "February 1, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Great", "publishers": "Great", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/142595-seikimatsu-tanemaki-densetsu-shoujo-yuugi-ai-no-tame-ni-shine\n"}
