{"altername_name": ["Nagakute Amai Yoru: Twilight Zone III"], "name": "Twilight Zone III: Nagakute Amai Yoru", "overview": "Several months have passed since the protagonist of this game experienced the sexual pleasures and horrors of the mysterious mansion. One day he goes on a date with a girl named Reiko, and his girlfriend Y\u014dko gets jealous. Returning home, the young man begins to think of his behavior and how to improve it, and gradually sinks into a dream that takes him back to the mansion and back to sex. The third installment of the Twilight Zone series is very similar to its predecessor visually and gameplay-wise. Like the previous game, it is a pseudo-3D first-person dungeon crawler with turn-based battles against naked girls, where RPG activities are replaced by sexual positions and alike. New in this iteration is an automap feature and a point-and-click interface for the basic battle command, allowing the player to choose a girl's body part to touch.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Great", "publishers": "Great", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133053-twilight-zone-iii-nagakute-amai-yoru\n"}
