{"altername_name": ["Filsnown"], "name": "Filsnown: Hikari to Toki", "overview": "Long time ago, seven gods who were guarding the Earth defeated the evil god Gadim. But time has passed, and the seven benevolent gods have vanished one by one. Evil has awaken from its slumber. It's time for somebody else - a human - to become a hero and to defeat it once and for all. This chosen one is a young girl named Thiria Fray. She must find other girls with supernatural powers to aid her on her quest to defeat the evil. Filsnown plays like a standard top-down Japanese RPG: the party of heroines roams the world map, descend into dungeons, fight random enemies in first-person perspective combat using regular attacks or magic, and visit towns and villages to buy supplies and to rest. It contains cut-scenes with nudity and explicit sexual situations.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "August 3, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Leaf", "publishers": "Leaf", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133337-filsnown-hikari-to-toki\n"}
