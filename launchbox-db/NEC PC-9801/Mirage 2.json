{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mirage 2", "overview": "The sequel to Mirage is set in the same world and features some recurrent characters, although the protagonist and the story are different. The main character is a young monster hunter named Etranze. He needs to slay a certain amount of monsters to reach a higher level, but meanwhile is struggling to be accepted among other heroes. This changes when he befriends Tree, Neat, and Lawn, the three lovely ladies who work (of all places) in the local church. Soon Etranze is summoned by queen Irene, who sends him on a quest to find a magical artifact that will save her kingdom from great peril. Like its predecessor, Mirage 2 is a dungeon crawler. The dungeon exploration is done in 3D and is viewed from first-person perspective. Randomly appearing enemies must be defeated in turn-based combat. The player directly controls only Etranze in battle; his companion (the first one is Tree) is controlled by the AI, attacking or casting healing magic. Like the first game, Mirage 2 contains scenes with nudity, mild sexual situations, and pretty demonic female enemies who undress when defeated.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "December 2, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Discovery", "publishers": "Discovery", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/132125-mirage-2\n"}
