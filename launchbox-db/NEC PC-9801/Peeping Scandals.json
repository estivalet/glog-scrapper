Players choose one of the girls (Sayuri, Hiromi, Kumiko, Erika or Tomoko) and slide the tiles until they've completed an area of the screen. As soon as players have finished putting the tiles in order, the next area is open for them to solve. Solving all 10 areas will unlock a picture of the girl the players have chosen. The game has a password system with players inputting keywords to resume the game with the areas they've already cleared.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "December 1, 1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Bothtec", "publishers": "Bothtec", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/139811-peeping-scandals\n"}
