{"altername_name": [], "name": "Magic++", "overview": "A young girl who was studying at the Demonic King Academy (a very interesting college, to say the least) decided to resurrect an evil demon (just doing her homework). News of this resurrection traveled to the Academy of Heroes. Instructor Nina sent one of the youngest, but most talented students, the purple-haired girl Piroron, to check if the rumor is true. Piroron found the wilderness area of the kingdom infested by monsters. Now the young apprentice has to fight for her life!.. Magic++ is a top-down action game. The player navigates Piroron through hostile areas, helping her to defeat the enemies who try to kill her. Enemies utilize ranged as well as melee attacks, but so does Piroron; in various treasure chests she can find weapons, although her basic attack is a ranged energy ball. When defeated, enemies turn into various items: hearts, which replenish Piroron's hit points; bombs, which will damage Piroron if she comes too close; and various collectible items (stars etc.) that serve the following purpose: once Piroron has collected enough items of a certain kind (sometimes in combination with other items), she will gain access to powerful special techniques. The more items Piroron has collected, the more times she can execute the special attack. Piroron can also jump, and this ability is required in many areas.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "December 24, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Cosmos Computer", "publishers": "Cosmos Computer", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137437-magic\n"}
