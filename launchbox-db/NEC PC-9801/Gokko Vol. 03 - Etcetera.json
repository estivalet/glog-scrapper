{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gokko Vol. 03: Etcetera", "overview": "\"Etcetera\" describes quite well the content of this game, which is the third volume in the Gokko series. While the two previous games were dedicated to certain themes or scenarios (doctor and school girls, respectively), the third one is a collection of multi-thematic stories of a sexual nature. The protagonist is a young Japanese male (default name Shouhei), and his first objective is to seduce his boss's sexy sister. In following chapters, the hero encounters other women (sports car driver, journalist, etc.), each encounter ending the way one would expect from an eroge. The gameplay is identical to the other games in the series. There is no permanent interaction menu, commands are always context-sensitive, mostly being conversation responses or choices of actions. Some choices are purely cosmetic; others might lead to Game Over; finally, certain choices unlock additional CGs. The final chapter of the game is playable only if the player has unlock a sufficient amount of CGs while playing the previous chapters.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "December 16, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Mink", "publishers": "Mink", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137237-gokko-vol-03-etcetera\n"}
