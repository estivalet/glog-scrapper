{"altername_name": [], "name": "F-16 Fighting Falcon 2", "overview": "The long Falcon simulation legacy of hardcore simulations of the F-16 fighter plane begins here. The plane's electronic displays and radars are simulated fully, with 4 styles of HUD. Not only can your plane barrel-roll and scissor, the enemy planes can too, with Artificial Intelligence recreating the moves of a real pilot. This was one of the earliest games to offer head-to-head play by linking two machines. It comes with a massive manual, detailing all those functions.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sphere", "publishers": "ASCII", "genres": "Flight Simulator", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/132696-f-16-fighting-falcon-2\n"}
