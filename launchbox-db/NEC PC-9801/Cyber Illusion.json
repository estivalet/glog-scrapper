{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cyber Illusion", "overview": "Around the turn of the millennium, global warming has become a reality. Abusing energy and the Earth's resources, humanity has driven itself to a point where normal life on Earth could no longer exist. Drastic rise of temperatures caused planet-wide dehydration. The only way to keep existing was through the Cyber Net, a virtual reality system. But soon the Cyber Net began to suffer from continuous assaults by hackers, who programmed lethal viruses into it. Thus, the Cyber Police was born. The protagonist of the game is a high-ranked officer of Cyber Police. With the help of his team, he has to solve the hacker problem once and for all. Cyber Illusion is a Japanese-style adventure. The interaction with the game world is performed by choosing the menu commands Look, Talk, Move, as well as context-specific ones that appear during some scenes. It is also possible to influence the course of the story by making choices at certain points. The game has explicit sex scenes, which are interactive and feature a point-and-click interface.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "September 22, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Pearl Soft", "publishers": "Pearl Soft", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/136568-cyber-illusion\n"}
