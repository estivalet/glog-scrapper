{"altername_name": [], "name": "Steel Gun Nyan", "overview": "Steel Gun Nyan is a fan game based on the first Steel Gunner released by doujin group Studio Genmai cha, which is sometimes called Studio Brown Rice. Steel Gun Nyan was an attempt to port the first game to the PC-9801. Its final version was completed and released at Comiket five years after Steel Gunner came out, and the amount of work and effort shows. The PC-9801 was not especially known for fast, arcade action games, but Steel Gun Nyan pushes the PC-9801 hardware to its absolute limit to capture the feel of the first Steel Gunner. The port is not perfect, but it is still amazing that such a feat could be done by a small group of programmers.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "", "developers": "Genmai cha", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/--wbdJYaiGk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/139251-steel-gun-nyan\n"}
