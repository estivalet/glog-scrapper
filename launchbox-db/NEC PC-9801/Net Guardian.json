{"altername_name": [], "name": "Net Guardian", "overview": "Net Guardian is a doujin shoot-em-up for the PC98 released by Moguraya Soft in 1997. Though Net Guardian doesn\u2019t bring anything new to the table and looked dated even back when it was first released, it\u2019s still a very weird and remarkable game. The story is about an antivirus program represented by a fairy flying through the internet to destroy computer viruses. Computer viruses usually take the form of either a giant robot or a giant cartoon girl who is always wearing something ridiculous.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "1997", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Moguraya Soft", "publishers": "Moguraya Soft", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsqtpM3-vE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/159141-net-guardian\n"}
