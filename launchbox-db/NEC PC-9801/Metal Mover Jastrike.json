{"altername_name": ["Metal Mover Jaststrike"], "name": "Metal Mover Jastrike", "overview": "During the first few decades of the space era, humanity was able to exist in a relative peace. But soon rogue organizations collectively known as space pirates began to terrorize space stations. This led to a series of violent conflicts. Both sides developed various types of giant mechs operated by human pilots, called \"Metal Movers\". A special police force was founded to combat the pirates. The young pilot Gingie and his lovely companion Windy must defend the space station and eventually venture into enemy territory. Metal Mover Jastrike is a top-down shooter. The player navigates a mech through maze-like hostile areas, fighting enemies on the way. Enemies respawn whenever the protagonist re-enters a screen. The mech possesses a basic melee weapon, mid-range laser attack, as well as powerful missile and grenade launchers with limited ammunition. Defeated enemies sometimes drop power-ups which may increase the player character's hit points or shields, eliminate all enemies on screen, etc. Anime-style cutscenes advance the plot between missions. Some of them contain explicit nudity and erotic themes.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "August 11, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Apple Pie", "publishers": "Apple Pie", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133577-metal-mover-jastrike\n"}
