{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pink Sox 2", "overview": "Pink Sox 2 is a collection of adult-themed mini-games in various genres. It includes the continuation of the sci-fi Japanese-style adventure (entitled Who Is There?) from the previous game; another scenario in the mini-adventure Halftime Lover; a simple card game of a slightly different variety (the goal is to run out of cards by selecting those of a higher value than the opponent's); and a mini-game that combines elements of quiz with tile-matching puzzle, leading to an erotic image different from the one in the first game.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "March 4, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Wendy Magazine", "publishers": "Wendy Magazine", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137708-pink-sox-2\n"}
