{"altername_name": ["Dragon Master Silk: Ry\u016b Sh\u014dkan Musume"], "name": "Dragon Master Silk: Ryuu Shoukan Musume: Episode II", "overview": "The first entry in the Dragon Master Silk series, Ry\u016b Sh\u014dkan Musume has a very simple plot: a girl named Silk is chosen by the Dragon King to be the Dragon Master, controlling the powers of three elemental dragons: fire, water, and earth. Aided by these three dragons (who look like cute young girls and are called Aka, Ao, and Ki, which means, respectively, \"red\", \"blue\", and \"yellow\" in Japanese), Silk has to venture into a magical dungeon and to defeat the evil lurking inside. The game is a dungeon crawler with pseudo-3D graphics, random enemy encounters, and turn-based combat. The player has control over the party of four girls, who have different characteristics in physical strength and magic casting. There is some mild erotic content (innuendos and skimpy clothing), but no explicit nudity or sexual situations.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "December 4, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Gimmick House", "publishers": "Gimmick House", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133168-dragon-master-silk-ryuu-shoukan-musume-episode-ii\n"}
