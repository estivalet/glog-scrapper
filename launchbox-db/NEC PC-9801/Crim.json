{"altername_name": [], "name": "Crim", "overview": "A doujin puzzle game where you play a small witch battling her way through whimsical opponents. On each level, you have to pick up all the keys, then exit the door, while avoiding monsters. You can use space to fire your wand, which will stun monsters, although they'll still kill you if you run into them, even while stunned. It's slow paced and pretty easy. Instead of a boss, even 5 levels or so you get treated to a \"Crim Theater\" cutscene.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tsukka Software", "publishers": "Tsukka Software", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162008-crim\n"}
