{"altername_name": [], "name": "Foreigner", "overview": "Klaus is a young man who has seen Jessica, the love of his life, killed in front of his eyes. Blaming himself for not being able to stop it, Klaus joins a group of mercenaries. Traveling together with his friends Bayse and Miria, Klaus encounters Stella, the princess of Valnausha. After the princess gets kidnapped, Klaus swears that he'll do everything he can to bring her back... Foreigner is a RPG with a navigation system and interaction reminiscent of Japanese adventures. Menu-based commands (\"Look\", \"Talk\", etc.) are present at every screen, and the game lacks physical movement: even in hostile areas (dungeons), the player moves around by selecting screens on a mini-map, which takes him to the next picture. The RPG angle is traditional Japanese style, minus the physical navigation; when Klaus and his party are attacked, a combat screen with battle commands (\"Attack, \"Magic\", etc.) appears. It is possible to buy items and weapons, and the heroes gain experience points and level up in a standard RPG fashion. There is sexual innuendo and mild nudity in the game, but no explicit sex.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "November 25, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Great", "publishers": "Great", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137196-foreigner\n"}
