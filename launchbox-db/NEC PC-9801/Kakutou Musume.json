{"altername_name": [], "name": "Kakutou Musume", "overview": "Ryoko was a police officer, until a tragic accident that happened to her colleague, and the inability of the police force to stop the criminals, has convinced her that becoming a vigilante was a more effective way. Now Ryoko trains to become the best martial artist, taking on the best fighters in the country... Kakut\u014d Musume is structured like a fighting game, but in reality it is primarily a turn-based card game. The game has two modes, Story and Exhibition. The story mode allows the player to control Ryoko between the cut scenes, fighting female opponents as dictated by the story. The exhibition mode allows the player to fight controlling any of the characters that appear in the story mode. The fights are always one-on-one. The player is dealt a deck of five cards, each representing a certain fighting move (attack, defense, heal, etc.). cards of the same type can be used in an accumulative way, increasing their effect. Attack moves also require the player to stop a rotating list of moves to select a specific move. Winning two rounds leads to victory and continuation of the story. Between the fights, the actual protagonist of the game (Ryoko's male manager) usually has sex with the defeated girls. The sex scenes are built like a mini-game, in which the player is required to reach a girl's \"pleasure bar\" by repeatedly tapping a button (or clicking the mouse). However, too intense tapping might result in the protagonist's premature ejaculation, forcing the player to replay the whole scene.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "November 20, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Musumeya", "publishers": "Musumeya", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137383-kakutou-musume\n"}
