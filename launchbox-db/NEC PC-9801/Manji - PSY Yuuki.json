{"altername_name": ["Manji: PSY Y\u016bki"], "name": "Manji: PSY Yuuki", "overview": "Manji: PSY Y\u016bki is set in medieval Japan, but has many supernatural elements and bizarre anachronisms. The heroine of the game, Asako, is helping the priest in a secluded Buddhist temple. One day she hears a baby wailing outside. She calls the baby Taro, and the statues of the bodhisattva Kannon advise her to seek a spirit named Pusheck. Asako calls upon her own personal spirit, who looks like a modern-day boy and is appropriately named Boy, and the three explore the nearby mountain to find the mysterious Pusheck. The game contains typical Japanese RPG elements such as top-down exploration, randomly appearing enemies, simple leveling up system, and turn-based first-person perspective combat. The characters have three point bars: body, soul, and mind. Body is equivalent to HP, soul influences combat performance, and mind is needed to use \"mind powers\", which are the same as magic spells. There are also 64 kinds of upgrades, which can be collected in battles; each one of them raises certain parameters or has an otherwise beneficial effect on the characters.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "March 22, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "PSD", "publishers": "PSD", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/136483-manji-psy-yuuki\n"}
