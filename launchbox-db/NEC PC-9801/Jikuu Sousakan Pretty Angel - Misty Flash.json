{"altername_name": ["Misty Flash"], "name": "Jikuu Sousakan Pretty Angel: Misty Flash", "overview": "In the future, humans have invented the time machine. However, criminals soon found a way to manipulate it and hide from the authorities by traveling to the past. As a result, human history began changing itself. In order to put an end to this, a special group called Misty Flash was assembled. Consisting of three young and attractive women - Mai, Yuri, and Miki - the group travels to different time periods, locates criminals, but also liberally enjoys the pleasures of flesh. Misty Flash is a hybrid of Japanese-style adventure and card-based battles. Short adventure segments feature traditional menu-based interface; typically, the player has to exhaust all options before the next event is triggered. Confrontations against female criminals take the shape of turn-based battles. The player is dealt a deck of cards representing normal attacks, special attacks, healing, as well as buffing up attack power and defense. In addition, each card has a number from 1 to 9; the higher this number is, the stronger is the effect of the card. Battles end with interactive, menu-based lesbian sex scenes.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "October 14, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Peppermint Kids", "publishers": "Peppermint Kids", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147776-jikuu-sousakan-pretty-angel-misty-flash\n"}
