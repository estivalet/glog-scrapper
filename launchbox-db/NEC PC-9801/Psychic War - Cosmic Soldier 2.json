Psychic War: Cosmic Soldier 2 is the sequel to Cosmic Soldier. Like the first game, it is a \"dungeon-crawling\" RPG where you control your character as he explores the many levels of Samar, encounters Psychic soldiers and fights in mental battles. Unlike the first game, the battles here are action-based, requiring quick reaction and timing. When encountering an enemy character you can shoot him or her with your mind beam and hopefully beat them. You will find clues and objects on your adventure which you can question Kayla with. You can use different psychic powers to fight, explore and defend yourself. Along the way you can also find allies that will want you join you on your quest and you will be able to use these characters as well in your battles.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "June 26, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Kogado Software Products", "publishers": "Kogado Software Products", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/136486-psychic-war-cosmic-soldier-2\n"}
