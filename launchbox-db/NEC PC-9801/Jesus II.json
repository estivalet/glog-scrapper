{"altername_name": [], "name": "Jesus II", "overview": "On board the ship Callisto, sailing through the Mediterranean Sea, are two friends from Japan - Kazuya Goshiki and Shinji Saeki, on their way to Monaco, where they want to compete in a motor race using their three-wheel drive. Suddenly, the ship stops moving. Kazuya talks to the captain and finds out that a large container has just dropped from the sky into the sea. Most of the passengers assume it was junk thrown out of a space ship; but shortly afterwards, several crew members are murdered under mysterious circumstances. Kazuya begins to see a connection to a Halley's Comet incident that happened four years ago, and realizes things are much worse than anyone else would assume... Jesus II is a sequel to Jesus: Ky\u014dfu no Bio-Monster. Though the setting and the protagonists are different, characters from the previous game appear in the sequel as well. Gameplay-wise, Jesus II is a Japanese-style adventure with a large amount of dialogue and very simple interaction: the player is only able to choose basic commands such as \"Examine\", \"Talk\", \"Move\", etc., without the possibility of selecting objects to interact with. Most of the game consists of visiting various locations on the ship, and talking to characters, gradually unraveling the mystery.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "September 22, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Enix Corporation", "publishers": "Enix Corporation", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133497-jesus-ii\n"}
