In the story mode the player takes control of either Miyuki or Emily, respectively a Japanese and an American martial artist who must take part in a contest organized by the powerful society of Egberd. Either of them faces the same three opponents in a linear fashion; afterwards they must fight each other and finally the antagonist of the story. The versus mode allows players to choose their own opponents in any order. Opponents gradually undress when defeated, and their erotic pictures can be viewed in the special CG mode.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "October 27, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Agumix", "publishers": "Agumix", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106148-the-queen-of-duellist\n"}
