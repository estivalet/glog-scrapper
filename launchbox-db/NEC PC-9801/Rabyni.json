{"altername_name": ["Rabuyuni"], "name": "Rabyni", "overview": "Reiji Imari is an ordinary teenager who doesn't get much attention from his female schoolmates. He has a tendency to voyeurism and likes spying on girls and taking their photos. One day his young and attractive teacher catches him during such an escapade, and as a result he is obliged to follow her orders, which may also include sexual services. Rabyni (A Russian word meaning \"female slaves\") plays like a Japanese-style adventure, albeit without regular verb commands and no possibility to interact with the environment by selecting objects from a menu. Most of the gameplay involves repeatedly visiting different locations and triggering events. There are no branches in the storyline. Explicit sexual cutscenes are animated.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "June 21, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "C's Ware", "publishers": "C's Ware", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137562-rabyni\n"}
