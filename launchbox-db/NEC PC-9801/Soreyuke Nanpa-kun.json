{"altername_name": [], "name": "Soreyuke Nanpa-kun", "overview": "A young man named Hidetsugu dreams of having a girlfriend. One day he meets a girl on the street and tries to impress her. However, a rival appears unexpectedly and the girl is unable to choose between them. The two have a conversation and agree that the stronger men is the one who has more experience with women. Hidetsugu then embarks on a quest to meet young women and work his charms on them. Soreyuke Nanpa-kun is an adventure game that predominantly follows the Japanese format, being puzzle-less and relying on triggering events rather than exploring and solving problems. However, it is distinguished by its fairly open-ended nature and the strictness of its choices. The player can select various locations from a menu and choose actions that would lead to meetings with various women. Verb commands would often lead to sub-menus of objects and non-standard choices. Even smaller choices may open different paths and lock out others. Many choices result in a Game Over as well. A few items may be bought or otherwise procured, and possessing them may alter subsequent events. Successfully completing a date (i.e. ending it with a sexual intercourse) closes the arc of the correspondent character; the final goal is to \"score\" with all the women encountered in the game.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "October 4, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Virgin House", "publishers": "Virgin House", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137620-soreyuke-nanpa-kun\n"}
