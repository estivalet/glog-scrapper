{"altername_name": [], "name": "Star Cruiser II: The Odysseus Project", "overview": "As humans evolved and began to colonize space, they encountered a large alien organization known as the Galaxy Alliance. Hostilities between various human factions and aliens were inevitable. In addition to that, a mysterious group known as the VOID started to carry out attacks on civilians. Mercenaries and space explorers, called \"hunters\", formed a treaty of their own, and one of them must face the VOID and bring peace to the galaxy. The Odysseus Project is a follow-up to Star Cruiser. Gameplay concept and visual style are very similar to that of the predecessor: it is a first-person 3D shooter with extensive exploration and customization elements, which grants it a light role-playing angle. Much of the game is spent on planet surfaces, in populated or hostile areas. Combat is action-based by default, but there is an option for a menu-based combat as well. There is a variety of weapons, armor, gadgets, and items to find or purchase. It is also possible to physically navigate a spaceship. Combat in space plays similarly to on-foot battles, with the additional of a freely rotatable camera.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "June 18, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Arsys Software", "publishers": "Arsys Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/MpwQM47qkEo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/136488-star-cruiser-ii-the-odysseus-project\n"}
