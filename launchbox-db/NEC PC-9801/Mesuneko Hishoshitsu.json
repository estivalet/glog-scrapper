{"altername_name": ["Mesunko Hishiyoshitsu"], "name": "Mesuneko Hishoshitsu", "overview": "Kurou works in a company that specializes in \"headhunting\", finding and recruiting capable employees for big companies. A new client representing a company that has recently concluded a trade with an American software firm needs a new secretary. Problem: the last headhunter who was given a similar request has gone missing. So Kurou's boss wants him to get to the bottom of things, teaming him up with the resourceful and pretty headhuntress Tomoko. Naturally, as the partners begin the investigation, dark erotic secrets of the employees become gradually revealed... Mesuneko Hishoshitsu is essentially a visual novel. Though there is a rudimentary menu-based navigation in the game, the focus on the gameplay is on making decision rather than interaction with the environment through commands. Some of the decisions lead to premature endings, while others unlock additional scenes (mostly of a sexual nature).", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "December 22, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Melody", "publishers": "Melody", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137466-mesuneko-hishoshitsu\n"}
