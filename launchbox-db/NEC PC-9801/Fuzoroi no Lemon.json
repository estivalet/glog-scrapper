{"altername_name": [], "name": "Fuzoroi no Lemon", "overview": "Machida Haruko, nicknamed \"Faru\", is a young girl who was living together with her sister Mei. Mei has mysteriously disappeared, and one day Faru received a package, which contained a video showing her sister, tortured by unknown people, crying in agony. The young heroine heads to the high school Mei studied in. She tries to get a job there, in order to investigate the circumstances of her sister's disappearance, and bring her home safe... Fuzoroi no Lemon has characteristics of a Japanese-style adventure, having no puzzles and relying on visiting places randomly to trigger events in order to advance the story. However, unlike most Japanese adventures, the game plays from a top-down perspective, allowing physical movement around the game world. Most of the gameplay is dedicated to walking around, finding important people and talking to them. Some of the dialogues have multiple conversation topics. The game has its own clock, which is advanced when the heroine visits different locations. Some of the events (such as lessons, beginning and end of work time, certain people being inc certain places, etc.) depend on this inner schedule, the goal sometimes becoming to catch the right person at the right time and place. The game has scenes with explicit sexual content.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "January 21, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Soft House Bon bee Bon Bon", "publishers": "Soft House Bon bee Bon Bon", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137203-fuzoroi-no-lemon\n"}
