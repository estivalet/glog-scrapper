{"altername_name": ["Cyber Arms Val-Kaizer"], "name": "Kikou Soushin Val-Kaizer", "overview": "In 21st century humanity started other planets colonization. Along with \"bioloader\" research to create a strengthened outer protective skin was underway. The lead researcher was afraid of military use of bioloader and set an explosion in the laboratory. His sister was found on the place of explosion miraculously saved. The company originated from MIN and had close ties with Sogna, so it's not a surprise that it's a graphics oriented story with frequent use of animation. This is a fast-paced action story about Luna, her kidnapped sister, military organization and small robot Val-Kaizer who has some connection with Luna. Game features pseudo-rpg exploration while escaping the facility, but overall is a very easy command selection type of game. Game does not have HCG, but at the end it features part 2 of the story with HCG, but part 2 never came out. The visuals and cute characters make this short game very entertaining.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "July 31, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Silence", "publishers": "Silence", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/136567-kikou-soushin-val-kaizer\n"}
