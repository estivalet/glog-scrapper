{"altername_name": ["Reijiyu: Twin Road"], "name": "Reijuu: Twin Road", "overview": "The town of Jester is located near a spring, which is used both by humans from the town and the beast people from their forest village. For years, the two races co-existed in peace. But one day, somebody sets the Jester tavern on fire. The authorities arrest a young beast girl who happened to be in the town at that time. Outraged by the injustice, a young orphan boy named Kein, who was raised by Tyrone, one of the town knights, convinces him to help the girl escape. But that act draws the ire of the town authorities, and the heroes realize that they have to flee... Reij\u016b - Twin Road is a mixture of RPG and strategy. Unlike most Japanese turn-based strategy RPGs, there is movement in the game (exploring towns and world map). The though battles are pre-set in usually take a while to complete, with strategic combat that allows free movement on the battle field. Some of the characters can cast offensive and healing spells. Each attack is displayed as a short animated sequence on a separate screen. Each character gains experience immediately after defeating an enemy, and can level up in the middle of the battle. The game contains scenes with nudity and mild sexual situations.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "January 19, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Apple Pie", "publishers": "Apple Pie", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137549-reijuu-twin-road\n"}
