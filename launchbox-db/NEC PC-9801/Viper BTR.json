{"altername_name": [], "name": "Viper BTR", "overview": "Viper BTR is a direct sequel to the short story that was part of Viper V-12, Magical Gambler. The original story was about a little girl named Ruri who received a magic wand from two dice-shaped familiars, and as a result turned into Chiyomi, a sexy gambling queen who abused her new powers to win money. In Viper BTR, the familiars return and give Ruri another chance to use her powers for good. However, she encounters Mai, another girl who underwent a similar transformation, thanks to her own familiar Domino. But unlike Ruri/Chiyomi, Mai uses her power for good. Will the heroine be able to join her or will envy and greed control her once again? Viper BTR differs from other Viper games by incorporating a new genre into the usual \"choose-your-own-adventure\" gameplay, namely mahjong. There is an obligatory mahjong match in the game that the heroine has to win, and also a special \"mahjong mode\", accessed from the main menu. The rest of the game consists of pictures with text as well as animated sequences; however, unlike in other Viper games, there is rudimentary navigation in \"Viper BTR\" (at certain points it is possible to choose a location to go to from a menu list). Also not quite typically for a Viper game, the story of \"Viper BTR\" is not composed entirely of pornographic scenes, and the sexual content is milder than in any other Viper game before.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "July 5, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Sogna", "publishers": "Sogna", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133084-viper-btr\n"}
