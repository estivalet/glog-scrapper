{"altername_name": [], "name": "Panorama Club", "overview": "Panorama Club is a turn-based game with similarities to board games with adventure-like elements. There are four scenarios in the game, accessible directly from the main menu. The scenarios include a treasure hunt in a dungeon with traps, a polar rescue expedition, exploration of a modern apartment building, and saving various creatures in a fantasy environment. Each scenario has its own goal. The player character (different in each scenario) and the AI-controlled opponent take turns in moving over a map divided into fields. The objective is to attain the goal of the scenario before the opponent. Each scenario, however, involves repeated visits to the same fields to trigger events and advance the story, giving the game a light adventure-like flavor. Both the player character and the opponent have hit points, which can be reduced by stepping on fields with negative effects (such as hostile creatures, traps, etc.), but also replenished on other fields. Losing all hit points brings the character to square one. The game includes some scenes with explicit nudity.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "November 26, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Software House Parsley", "publishers": "Software House Parsley", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137508-panorama-club\n"}
