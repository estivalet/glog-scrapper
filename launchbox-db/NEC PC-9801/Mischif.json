{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mischif", "overview": "Long time ago, the Magic World and our world were not on good terms. But now, it has become different - or has it?.. In any case, a young spoiled boy named Frito, from a rich Magic World family, has to get married - and his father tells him to choose a spouse from our world. Frito's trusted servant, an elf-like creature named Fin, finds three suitable girls: a Japanese high-school student (naturally), a maid, and a Wild West farmer girl. Who will become the happy bride?.. Mischif (sic) is a Japanese adventure, with verb commands (\"Look\", \"Talk\", \"Think\", etc.), which usually have to be depleted to advance the story. It is possible to \"tackle\" the girls in any order. Once the player character becomes intimate with a girl, the game switches to a point-and-click interface with a variety of sexual commands. It is also possible to die in the game by selecting the wrong command in certain situations.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "December 23, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Basement", "publishers": "Basement", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137471-mischif\n"}
