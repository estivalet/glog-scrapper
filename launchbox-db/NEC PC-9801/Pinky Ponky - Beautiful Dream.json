{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pinky Ponky: Beautiful Dream", "overview": "The first chapter in the Pinky Ponky series is an adult dating game combining elements of simulation and visual novel. The player character is a young male who is seeing an erotic dream. The game depicts his fictional encounters with various young women in different locations, and the gameplay consists entirely of selecting dialogue lines or (in advanced stages) sex-related actions. Each girl has a satisfaction bar that must be increased by choosing the right lines. Some choices won't affect that bar, while others will reduce it, sometimes drastically or instantly leading to the scenario's end. The game usually requires the player to discover near-perfect series of lines to advance to the next dating segment. Failure to do so prematurely concludes the scenario, leading to the next one.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Elf", "publishers": "elf", "genres": "Life Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137517-pinky-ponky-beautiful-dream\n"}
