{"altername_name": ["T\u014dshin Toshi II"], "name": "Toushin Toshi II", "overview": "A young boy named Seed Kasim was dreaming of a peaceful life in his home village with the girl of his dreams. However, the girl's father made it clear that he'll only accept a strong warrior as his son-in-law. Accompanied by his childhood friend, the gorgeous Selena, Seed heads to the city, where the Battle God Tournament takes place. The young man must venture to the nearby dungeon, defeating the monsters lurking there, while being careful of other tournament participants... T\u014dshin Toshi 2 plays similarly to its predecessor and to most other Alice Soft RPGs: most of the game is dedicated to exploring maze-like top-down dungeons (with auto-map feature), fighting random and event-related enemies in turn-based combat. Battles and town locations are viewed from first person perspective. Spirit Points (SP) are required to execute any attack; they can be replenished by \"resting\" (during battle), using special items, or walking (outside of battle). The game features explicit sex scenes.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "December 9, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Alice Soft", "publishers": "Alice Soft", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133449-toushin-toshi-ii\n"}
