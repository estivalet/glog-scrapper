{"altername_name": [], "name": "Kinbaku no Yakata", "overview": "Kinbaku no Yakata (meaning \"Bondage Mansion\") is a sadistic take on the \"raising simulation\" genre. Two brothers from a decayed nobility lineage live in a dark mansion, specializing in all things gruesome. The protagonist is one of the brothers, who wants to \"prove himself\" to the other one by kidnapping a young girl and turning her into his sex slave. The general gameplay is a simplified version of Princess Maker: the player manages a schedule of the victim, which mainly consists of sexual \"training\" (various sexual activities), as well as more \"mundane\" tasks as housework. Depending on the player's choices, the parameters of the girl change. The protagonist can also challenge his brother to combat; the outcome of the automatic battle depends on the results achieved when \"raising\" the sex slave.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "September 8, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "XYZ", "publishers": "Xyz", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147742-kinbaku-no-yakata\n"}
