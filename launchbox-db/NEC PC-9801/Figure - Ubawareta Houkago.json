{"altername_name": [], "name": "Figure: Ubawareta Houkago", "overview": "An oligarch named Takanashi has built a prestigious girl's high school, known as the Hanatsuki High. Mishima, a young man who has recently graduated high school, is approached by Isao, representative of the Hanatsuki High and his former schoolmate, with a part-time teaching job offer. Despite his dislike to certain school policies Mishima agrees - first, because he is broke, and second, because the perspective to teach the pretty daughters of the wealthiest people in Japan doesn't seem all that unpleasant... Figure: Ubawareta Houkago is mostly composed of text descriptions and dialogues accompanied by pictures. The game advances automatically, occasionally pausing to prompt the player to make a decision, which can be a choice of a location to visit, a dialogue choice, or an action choice. The game features a branching story-line with several endings.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "September 29, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Silky's", "publishers": "Silky's", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147634-figure-ubawareta-houkago\n"}
