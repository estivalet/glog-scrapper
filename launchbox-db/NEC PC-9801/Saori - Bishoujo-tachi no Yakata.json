{"altername_name": [], "name": "Saori: Bishoujo-tachi no Yakata", "overview": "A young woman named Saori is returning home late in the evening. Sex-related events seem to pursue her, from the word \"sex\" written on the wall in the public toilet to a couple having sex on a bench in the park. Shortly afterwards, Saori is abducted by a sadistic woman who locks her in a mysterious mansion. By visiting the rooms within, Saori unlocks erotic memories of its inhabitants, ultimately exposing them to the owner's cruel pleasures. Saori consists almost entirely out of explicit sex scenes, ranging from its milder varieties to incest and torture. Unlike in most Japanese adult games, there is no censorship of private body parts in this game. The player's interaction is confined to repeatedly selecting context-specific options until the next event is triggered. In the beginning of the game the player only has access to one room. Repeatedly visiting rooms triggers new scenes and eventually unlocks other rooms.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "October 18, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "FairyTale", "publishers": "FairyTale", "genres": "Visual Novel", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/141586-saori-bishoujo-tachi-no-yakata\n"}
