{"altername_name": ["Two Shot Diary 2: Memory 2/4"], "name": "2 Shot Diary 2: Memory 2/4", "overview": "This is the second of the four episodic games that constitute the sequel to first 2 Shot Diary game. Unlike the first game with its 12 different scenarios, it only contains 2, and both are very short; however (also unlike the first game), most of the scenes here are animated. Both scenarios consist entirely of depictions of explicit sex. One of the two scenarios shows a young girl named Mayumi in her house, when suddenly a stranger phones her, and the two have passionate telephone sex. The other scenario deals with a schoolgirl named Mai. She is ambushed by a gang of men who undress her and use her as a \"plate\" to arrange seafood on, which involves perversities which better remain unnamed. The gameplay follows the same template that was utilized in 2 Shot Diary: text and graphical scenes unfold automatically, and the player's input is restricted to choosing words from a list to fill blanks in sentences. This allows the player to interpret the events in various ways, effectively \"writing\" the girl's diary on his own.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "February 29, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mink", "publishers": "Mink", "genres": "Visual Novel", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.22", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147912-2-shot-diary-2-memory-24\n"}
