{"altername_name": [], "name": "Amaranth II", "overview": "Years have passed since the great hero Liann Fremdes defeated the evil Bosedorf and brought peace to the kingdom of Stellar, opening a new chapter in its glorious history. Liann has retired since then, hoping to have some peace for himself. But once a hero, always a hero: an aggressive nation from the West threatens the country, and help is needed. Liann arrives at the city of Strahl to talk to the local king, and hooks up with an elf girl named Din who is willing to accompany the hero on his travels... Amaranth II is the second in the series of action-based RPGs. The party roams the world in top-down fashion, levels up and buys equipment, just like in the first game. Attacks are performed by bumping into enemies, who can be seen on the screen before either the player or the enemy initiate combat.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "August 21, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Fuga System", "publishers": "Fuga System", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/123361-amaranth-ii\n"}
