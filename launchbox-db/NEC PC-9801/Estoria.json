{"altername_name": [], "name": "Estoria", "overview": "The land of Estoria was peaceful for a long time. The Gate of Darkness was securely sealed, with the Guardian protecting the five magical orbs that held the power to shut the Gate. But something terrible happened, the Gate of Darkness opened and began to swallow parts of the land. Yuu, the sole god and ruler of Estoria, calls his faithful warrior Achard to find a way to seal the Gate of Darkness again, and to restore peace in Estoria. Estoria is a RPG played entirely from top-down perspective. The player navigates Achard and his companions over the world map, visiting towns and entering dungeons on the way. Enemies appear randomly. Playable characters and enemies move on the battle screen, but the player can't control their movement manually. The player assigns commands to the characters (such as attack, use healing magic when low on HP, etc.), after which the battle evolves automatically. In this RPG, characters level up by repeatedly performing certain actions. For example, fighting with a sword will gradually increase the damage the character inflicts with this type of weapon; casting a lot of magic will increase its power, etc.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "March 11, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Soft Plan", "publishers": "Soft Plan", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137170-estoria\n"}
