{"altername_name": [], "name": "Akiko: Premium Version", "overview": "Akiko Yagami is a young woman who has just accepted a teaching job offer from the Noble Girls High School. She is determined to be a good teacher and concentrate on her work. But upon arriving, she realizes that the school is a playground for wild sex. Akiko is seduced by her female boss, witnesses sex scenes between students, and finally gives in to her urges... Akiko walks the middle ground between adventure and visual novel. There are almost no recurring commands, and the player mostly advances simply of going through the few possible choices. However, its is often necessary to move around the school (through the menu), and the command input is too frequent to consider the game a real visual novel.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "January 22, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Red-Zone", "publishers": "FairyTale", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133250-akiko-premium-version\n"}
