Kamikuishiki Village satirises the Aum Shinrikyo cult and the 1995 Tokyo subway sarin gas attack orchestrated by the cult; a common misconception is that the game was produced by the cult as propaganda, whereas The Story of Kamikuishiki Village actually portrays Aum and the sarin gas attack negatively, mocking its members and showing footage of 'humiliating' media coverage.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "June 29, 1995", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Happysoft", "publishers": "Aum Soft", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Story_of_Kamikuishiki_Village", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/370277-the-story-of-kamikuishiki-village\n"}
