{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mercury: The Prime Master", "overview": "When evolution reached its highest stage, the human species have emerged. Eventually, the humans became divided into three races: Fantura, Apocrypha, and Ende. The first two were proficient in all things magical, while the Ende civilization was technically the most advanced one, holding the secrets to robot construction and building beautiful cities in the skies. For many years, the three civilizations co-existed in peace. But an internal revolution in the Fantura countries led to a change of regime. The new leaders of Fantura invaded Ende, trying to get hold of their technological secrets. A young man named Chrom, who grew up in one of Ende's celestial cities, discovers that his mother belongs to the Apocrypha race. His mixed heritage and mysterious past are the key to the world's salvation. Despite its isometric perspective and the lack of anime-style touch in its graphics, Mercury: The Prime Master is a traditional Japanese RPG with all the typical ingredients: the party of heroes roam the world map, visiting cities to buy equipment, descending into dungeons, and fighting random enemies in turn-based style. Characters with magical civilization background have access to magical spells, and Chrom is also able to activate a robot to help the heroes in battles.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "December 8, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Maxima", "publishers": "Maxima", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/136735-mercury-the-prime-master\n"}
