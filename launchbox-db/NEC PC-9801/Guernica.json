{"altername_name": [], "name": "Guernica", "overview": "Long time ago, human passions caused the appearance of a monster tribe that has since become unwelcome in the human society. Years of bitter antagonism and violence followed as humans settled in the land of Galesnia. A thousand years later, a simple warrior named Grog enters a forest inhabited by monsters, and becomes gradually involved in a struggle that puts him in the forefront of the defense of Galesnia. Guernica is a Japanese-style role-playing game with radically simplified gameplay mechanics. There is no party, no monetary system, and no equipment of any kind. Only bars and inns can be accessed in towns. The world map is completely linear, as the protagonist is only able to move on the roads and locations appear on it only when triggered by the plot. Much of the game consists of exploring hostile locations, fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat that allows only physical attacks and usage of healing items that are randomly dropped by the foes. The game's cutscenes mostly depict explicit sexual encounters.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "February 9, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Back Spin", "publishers": "Back Spin", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133350-guernica\n"}
