{"altername_name": [], "name": "Wedding Errantry: Gyakutama Ou", "overview": "Seth is very indecisive with women. But as the quest for searching the proper groom for the princess of the kingdom is announced, Seth makes his move. The condition is clearing the training dungeon created by the court magician. Year 1994 does not have as many RPGs as 1990 or 1991, but those are of highest quality. So is this game, real masterpiece, but completely forgotten. The game starts very lightly as a comedy but with experience and story progression it gets heavily serious. Leveling up is well synchronized with the story events, so you see Seth to grow stronger just at the right moment and it really looks like lvl up affects the character of Seth each time - so there is great pleasure in watching Seth grow. He's not a hero, but he has strong motivation (princess promised to kiss 1000th adventurer to go to this dungeon and it was Seth) and he works hard every day. One nice feature was that the equipment was of multiple sizes like S, M, L and according to the kind of food taken in the shape of body was changing - in other words it was easy to find yourself not fitting in your favorite suit of armor, so in a way it was also a diet RPG. Game's not perfect - it's more complex than traditional RPGs so might not suit total newbies and it requires much tolerance to move step by step to the aim. With great story and character design, this game is a real treat for RPG lovers.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "December 9, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Grocer", "publishers": "Grocer", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/142621-wedding-errantry-gyakutama-ou\n"}
