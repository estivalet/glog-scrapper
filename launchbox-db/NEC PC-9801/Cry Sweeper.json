{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cry Sweeper", "overview": "A series of mysterious events has occurred in a seemingly normal high school somewhere in Japan. Girls have been reported missing or assaulted under mysterious circumstances. The police is helpless. Two people are determined to solve the mystery: Kai Shura, a man who can read minds and recall events from the past, and Ami Kanko, a girl who controls the powers of telekinesis. Will they ever be able to get to the bottom of the things, or will gruesome events continue to happen amidst innocent teenagers?.. Cry Sweeper plays, for the most part, like standard Japanese adventures, without puzzles or physical movement (navigation is done via menu choices and \"jumping\" to locations on the map). There are a few shooter sequences that occur late in the game. The interaction is done in point-and-click fashion, with context-sensitive cursor (\"Look\", \"Talk\", etc.). The game contains images of explicit sex.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "December 13, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "D.O.", "publishers": "D.O.", "genres": "Visual Novel", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/140500-cry-sweeper\n"}
