{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dare mo Shiranai... Ushinawareta Kioku no Tobira", "overview": "A woman is running through the night forest. She seems to be pursued by someone. Man sees a strange dream that she is terrified of an attack from behind. A disaster suddenly falls on the man and his lover. And the key word is \"Misty Blue\". Suspense horror novel. There are lots of branches in here but roughly they can be divided on two stories, of man and of woman. So difficulty is due to a big number of branches full of bad ends. Well, game is horrible, as for me. Protagonist is a woman so thoughts are very inconsistent. And it's not written who is talking so it makes less and less sense in the dialogues. Constant sudden twists of plot leave logic off the board. And the story is not that interesting - just about brother working on a secret project and of the flowers that have special power against the occult powers.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "April 18, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "XYZ", "publishers": "Xyz", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147612-dare-mo-shiranai-ushinawareta-kioku-no-tobira\n"}
