{"altername_name": ["Giri Giri Paradise"], "name": "Girigiri Paradise", "overview": "Girigiri Paradise has a rather simple story: the protagonist, a teenager named Keiichi, is having a vacation. Together with three young, pretty girls (initially only friends of his), he goes on a journey, which ends in a small hotel on the sea shore. Exploring the surroundings and meeting local people (some of which are young, pretty girls as well!), Keiichi realizes that this trip is gradually turning into the busiest sex adventure of his life... Girigiri Paradise doesn't have much gameplay; the only aspect where the player has some freedom is in choosing (from time to time) the location to go to. There are also some choices, mostly involving sexual activities. Depending on these choices, the player might see (or miss) certain scenes.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "January 23, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "May-Be Soft", "publishers": "May-Be Soft", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147702-girigiri-paradise\n"}
