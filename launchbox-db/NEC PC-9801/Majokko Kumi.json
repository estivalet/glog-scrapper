{"altername_name": [], "name": "Majokko Kumi", "overview": "Kumi is an ordinary Japanese teenage girl. At least she was ordinary until one day, walking back home, she spotted a shiny object falling from the sky into a nearby forest. Upon examining the object more closely, Kumi found a cute rabbit-like creature, who called himself Popp claimed to have come from a magical world. Popp granted Kumi the magical ability of shape-shifting: turning into an adult male of her choice... an ability Kumi will need in order to fulfill her mission: sexually satisfy female students and teachers from her high school... Majokko Kumi is a traditional Japanese adventure game, without puzzle and with menu-based verb \"Look- Talk - Think - Move\" interaction. Story progression is linear. Most of the game is dedicated to depleting all available options until the game takes the player to a new screen. Sex scenes also feature a point-and-click mouse interface, with a single cursor for all the actions.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "November 14, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Family Soft", "publishers": "Family Soft", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/140890-majokko-kumi\n"}
