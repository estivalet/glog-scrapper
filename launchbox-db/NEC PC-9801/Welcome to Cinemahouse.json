Much of the crew was conscripted, military censure is ravaging, but for a man of passion everything is possible. Each character has behavior patter lasting for 24 hours. According to that pattern we devise a plot and arrange actors in SLG part. Mostly we just approve or disapprove suggested variants, so it's not difficult. It's possible to talk to actors and those talks are masterfully done. If you done screening but want to start anew or shoot additional scenes, the schedule gets tight. There is also human relationships dimension and unexpected troubles that come up. Parents would naturally object in indecent role offered to the child. But the ADV part of the game is probably even better. You can walk around the town talking to inhabitants in the top down camera Classmates style immersing in the atmosphere of warring city. Even though the length of the game is not big, the degree of freedom and the replay value is great.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "January 28, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "HARD", "publishers": "HARD", "genres": "Visual Novel", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/145971-welcome-to-cinemahouse\n"}
