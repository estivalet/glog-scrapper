{"altername_name": [], "name": "L Elle", "overview": "Christmas 1999: an atomic war has begun. Most of the Earth's population was wiped out. Only a few millions remained. Three years have passed, and the leading scientists of the world started working on a project to re-build the planet. But not everyone agreed with them; some people were profiting from the chaos and devastation. Those people founded a terrorist organization called \"Black Widow\", with the goal to impede the project. To counter that, project leaders hired a group of five trained agents known as \"Snipers\". The protagonist of the game is a Class-A sniper named Joe, who is about to be trained by his colleagues... L Elle is a point-and-click adventure in Japanese style (no puzzles). The interaction with the environment is performed by moving the mouse cursor around; when it is possible to interact with an object, the cursor turns into a command icon (look, talk, push, take, etc., depending on the situation). The navigation is performed by selecting locations from a menu. The player advances by examining objects, talking to people, and unlocking new locations.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "June 23, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Elf", "publishers": "elf", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/127172-l-elle\n"}
