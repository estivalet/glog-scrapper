{"altername_name": [], "name": "Satyr", "overview": "The background story of Satyr is rather vague: the main character (default name Momojirou) is hired for two weeks to help a female gardener named Ayaka to grow flowers for celestial creatures - also female, young, and cute, though with elf-like ears and sometimes even wings. The goal here is to learn enough about different flowers, the ways to make them grow, and the preferences of the girls. The player is given exactly fourteen days of game time to accomplish this task. From the main screen it is possible to access information about flowers, check the weather conditions, talk to the girls (one time with each girl), then decide which flowers to plant. It is then possible to choose again with which girl to talk; sometimes they will ask different questions (about various topics, but mostly concerning flowers), and the answers will also influence their attitude towards the main character. Afterwards, a day of game time will pass. If the player is successful, the satisfied girls will pose naked, and eventually have sex with the hero.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Aypio", "publishers": "Aypio", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/139719-satyr\n"}
