{"altername_name": ["Two Shot Diary 2: Memory 1/4"], "name": "2 Shot Diary 2: Memory 1/4", "overview": "This is the first of the four episodic games that constitute the sequel to first 2 Shot Diary game. Unlike the first game with its 12 different scenarios, it only contains 2, and both are very short; however (also unlike the first game), most of the scenes here are animated. Both scenarios consist entirely of depictions of explicit sex. One of the scenarios is about a girl named Yukari; after her father died, she had to look for a job, and finally became a maid in a mansion of a rich oligarch, who molests her sexually. The other scenario is dedicated to a very young girl named Emi, who goes with her friends to the beach. Once she finds herself in a secluded place, a young boy approaches, and the two have sex. The gameplay follows the same template that was utilized in 2 Shot Diary: text and graphical scenes unfold automatically, and the player's input is restricted to choosing words from a list to fill blanks in sentences. This allows the player to interpret the events in various ways, effectively \"writing\" the girl's diary on his own.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "December 9, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mink", "publishers": "Mink", "genres": "Visual Novel", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147911-2-shot-diary-2-memory-14\n"}
