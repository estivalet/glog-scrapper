There are various scenarios for each, with air-to-air or ground missions, in \"cold war\" and full-scale war situations. Players can build up their pilot ranks through completed missions and medals. The game actually has two flight modes. In the \"authentic\" mode, you have only 2 weapon bays, but you have higher stealth rating. In the \"theoretical\" mode, you have 4 weapon bays like F-19 Stealth Fighter, but your plane is easier to detect due to a lower stealth rating.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "March 11, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "MicroProse Software", "publishers": "MicroProse Software", "genres": "Flight Simulator", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/132978-f-117a-nighthawk-stealth-fighter-20\n"}
