{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sweet Angel", "overview": "The player takes the role of Seisa, a bald-headed photographer. He likes sneaking into a high school and taking pictures of pretty girls. But one day he was caught and beaten by a girl who didn't want to be photographed. So Seisa plotted an elaborate revenge scheme: he managed to learn a spell that allowed him to look like different girls. Naturally, being one of the girls, it becomes much easier for our heroes to earn their trust - and to seduce them! Sweet Angel differs from the majority of Japanese adventures by allowing the player to physically move in the game world (from top-down perspective). Most important conversations and seduction scenes are still viewed from the traditional first-person perspective, with menu choices for different actions.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Active Software", "publishers": "Active Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/130950-sweet-angel\n"}
