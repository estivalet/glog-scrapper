{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sweet Days", "overview": "The hero spent summer vacation of high school third grade without doing anything. The school side persuaded him to leave the advanced course because of lack of academic ability and motivation. The mother of the protagonist is shocked by that. She asked revise that decision based on the results of forthcoming exams. She hired a neighbor Shinohara Aki who attends a famous national university as tutor. Aki, who secretly had feelings for the hero, willingly accepted and for three weeks before the proficiency test she will tutor the hero. Despite what synopsis might suggest, there are six heroines overall, but only Aki's route is somewhat well developed. And the other girls routes feel bad because you have to constantly skip studies and see grumpy Aki's face. It's quite a short game hardly reaching two hours length and most of that time is occupied by routine actions.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "October 31, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Pearl Soft", "publishers": "Pearl Soft", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147869-sweet-days\n"}
