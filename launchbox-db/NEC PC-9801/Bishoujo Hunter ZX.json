{"altername_name": ["Bish\u014djo Hunter ZX"], "name": "Bishoujo Hunter ZX", "overview": "In the 1990-ies, increased tension between powerful countries of the world and economic crisis have eventually lead to open hostility. By 2018, the world was nearly destroyed in a devastated war. A handful of scientists working for peace have devised a plan - called \"Project ZX\" - to prevent this disaster from happening. All they need are a dozen of young, pretty girls, who would be trained with the newest scientific equipment. The hero of the game is a lazy teenager, fan of computers and - surprise! - pretty girls, and he is the one who is entrusted by an old scientist to find and recruit these special girls, aided by a robotic bird named Chico. Bishoujo Hunter ZX is a text-heavy Japanese-style adventure. The game world is composed of still screens, which offer interaction in form of menu-based verb commands. Typically for the genre, events are often triggered by going through most or all the commands at any given screen.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "April 29, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Soft House Bon bee Bon Bon", "publishers": "Soft House Bon bee Bon Bon", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.12", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133255-bishoujo-hunter-zx\n"}
