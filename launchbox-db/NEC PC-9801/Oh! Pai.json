{"altername_name": [], "name": "Oh! Pai", "overview": "Oh! Pai is an adaptation of a tile game that has similarities to mahjong, though with much simpler rules. The player competes one-on-one against any of the six young women featured in the game. Each opponent offers a different thematic set of tiles (e.g. a stereotypical shy schoolgirl uses teddy bears, pink clothes, etc.), but the game rules are always the same: form simple combinations of three or more identical tiles to win. After each successful round the girl removed a part of her clothes.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "June 25, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Silky's", "publishers": "Silky's", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137502-oh-pai\n"}
