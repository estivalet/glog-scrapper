{"altername_name": ["Can Can Bunny 5 and half Limited"], "name": "Can Can Bunny 5 1/2 Limited", "overview": "The sixth (or fifth and a half, as the title suggests) installment of the long-running Can Can Bunny series belongs to the same story arc that started in the fourth game and was continued in the fifth. The player character is the same nameless hero that starred in the two predecessors. But in this game, the lovely goddess Swatty is not here to help the hero to find girls. Instead, all the hero gets is an apprentice goddess named Sawady, who is just a brat and who bothers the hero all the time. Looks like this is going to be the toughest quest yet, with Sawady around and with pretty, but tough-to-seduce girls! Gameplay-wise, Can Can Bunny 5 1/2 Limited is more simplified than the previous game. The standard menu commands (\"Look\", \"Talk\", etc.) are gone. The only possible interaction consists of moving to various locations (menu choice), and selecting a dialogue choice during conversations. There are also less girls than in the previous game, and no extras (such as the album with the pictures of the girls, etc.).", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "November 11, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Cocktail Soft", "publishers": "Cocktail Soft", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133267-can-can-bunny-5-12-limited\n"}
