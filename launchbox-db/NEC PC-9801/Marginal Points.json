{"altername_name": [], "name": "Marginal Points", "overview": "The Western kingdom of Endelunia is in grave danger. The forces of Darkness have invaded the country, threatening to conquer it completely and extinguish the power of Light. Princess Armantia appeals to the world's inhabitants to save the kingdom. Eventually, an unlikely hero joins forces with famous female warriors, and together they venture to drive the demonic invaders out of the country. Marginal Points is a turn-based tactical game with rather simple mechanics. The player controls an army represented by several key characters, which act as unit leaders. The amount of soldiers in each unit is equivalent to individual character hit points. The player navigates the leaders through top-down environment, attacking enemies when they are in weapon range. The actual hostile encounter is displayed on a separate screen, and proceeds automatically. Extended cutscenes advance the story between battles. These scenes may feature dialogue options and even short one-screen point-and-click segments.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "April 29, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Lunar Soft", "publishers": "Lunar Soft", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137453-marginal-points\n"}
