{"altername_name": [], "name": "Escape!", "overview": "In Escape, the player assumes the role of an ordinary teenager named Root. He is returning from a long journey, and just beyond the mountain, he can see his house. But fate had other plans for the boy: one step on the wrong stone, and Root falls through a dark pit into the underground world. Looks like it won't be simple for him to find the way home, because this world is populated by girls, each one of which wants something from him... Escape is an adventure game in Japanese style: it has no real puzzles, and has to be solved mainly by talking to different characters and taking some decisions. Unlike many other Japanese adventures, \"Escape\" is viewed from top-down perspective and allows the player character to walk around and to explore the rather large, sometimes maze-like locations. There are also different endings in the game, depending on the player's choices during it. The game contains explicit sex scenes.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "May-Be Soft", "publishers": "May-Be Soft", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137169-escape\n"}
