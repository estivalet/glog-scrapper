You roll dice,and move around the board fighting monsters and each other. Whenever a player loses a battle,they lose clothing. Sadly, I have no idea exactly how you win a game, as it appears opponents can't be eliminated. However, a reader was kind enough to mail in how to win: \"One of the players has to find the treasure chest in one of the spaces, and it has to open to reveal an orb with a golden dragon. Then she has to move to the little palace in the middle of the board, rolling on just enough spaces to get inside, and she wins.\"", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "AION", "publishers": "AION", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/139327-para-dice-kimi-wa-oihagi-o-mita-ka\n"}
