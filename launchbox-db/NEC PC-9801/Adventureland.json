{"altername_name": [], "name": "Adventureland", "overview": "Adventureland is an update to the text-only Adventureland from 1978. It has many additional features including: Hi-Res graphics, Text-to-Speech hardware support, upper- and lowercase support for display (but not for input). Gameplay is very similar to the original. You still use the same one or two word commands to move about and manipulate objects. The RETURN key toggles back and forth between graphics and text. The objective of the game is to collect all the treasures. There are all sorts of places to explore above and below ground. You have to outwit and escape many creatures during your quest including a dragon, a bear, and a hive of bees.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Scott Adams", "publishers": "StarCraft", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137675-adventureland\n"}
