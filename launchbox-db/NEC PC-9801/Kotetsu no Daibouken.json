{"altername_name": ["Kotetsu no Daib\u014dken", "Kotestu no Daiboken"], "name": "Kotetsu no Daibouken", "overview": "Kotetsu no Daib\u014dken is based on the anime The Adventures of Kotetsu. The titular heroine (real name Lynn Suzuki, nicknamed Kotetsu, which means Little Iron) is a young apprentice of martial arts who flees her cruel master and is accepted by the kind lady Miho Kuon, who runs a detective agency in Tokyo. The game can be perceived as a sequel to the anime, since it begins roughly where the original story ended, with the former \"nerdy\" spy Tatsuya Mikado already turned good and living by Miho Kuon along with Kotetsu and other heroes. Like the original anime, the game mixes modern setting with bizarre and supernatural elements. Unlike the anime, this game contains many explicit sexual scenes. The player-controlled character is for the most part Tatsuya Mikado. The gameplay consists of selecting menu-based commands. The interaction is minimal, and exploration (through menu commands as well) is possible only at a few points in the game. Most of the times, the player is presented with a menu screen containing two or more choices. Making a choice slightly alters the course of the story (mostly regarding the sex scenes). There are also a few turn-based battles in the game, which work a bit like rock-paper-scissors game: it is possible to attack, to raise the attack power of the next turn, or to defend. Correctly guessing the opponent's move is the key to victory.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "April 19, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "T2 Co.", "publishers": "T2 Co.", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/129046-kotetsu-no-daibouken\n"}
