{"altername_name": [], "name": "Schwarzschild IV: The Cradle End", "overview": "The Cradle End is the fourth entry in the Schwarzschild series. The events of the game take place in 3958, two years before those depicted in Schwarzschild II: Teikoku no Haishin. The setting this time is Bardis star system. The omnipresent dominance of empires has been replaced by alliances and struggle between smaller nations. The player takes control of Clair Youngleaf, the leader of one of these nations, who must decide its future fate through diplomacy and wars. The game's concept is identical to that of the previous installments of the series. Like before, grand strategy is the core of the game, while the actual battles proceed automatically, their outcome depending on the player's preparation rather than on tactical decisions. The interface has been changed once again, featuring windows that can be stretched and moved around. There are more diplomatic options and stronger emphasis on pacts and cooperation between nations. It is also possible to research and build fighter craft, as well as place satellites in space and cannons on planet surfaces. Like the previous game, The Cradle End has anime-style visuals and assigns individual characteristics to nation leaders.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "April 2, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kogado Studio", "publishers": "Kogado Studio", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133425-schwarzschild-iv-the-cradle-end\n"}
