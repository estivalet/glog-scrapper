{"altername_name": [], "name": "Chick's Tale", "overview": "Chicks' Tale is a card game with hentai scenes. Player-controlled character competes against four young girls. The rules of the game are rather simple: each player is dealt ten cards. Following clockwise turns, each player has either to play a card that has a higher value than the previous one, or pass. Winning a hand allows the player to begin the next turn with the card of his/her choice. It is also possible to play several cards of the same value at once. Whoever has played all the ten cards first wins the round. After three rounds, a cut-scene follows, during which the defeated character shares sexual experiences from her life, presented as sexually explicit images with text. Afterwards, the card game is resumed.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "February 15, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Riruhi's Party", "publishers": "Riruhi's Party", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137097-chicks-tale\n"}
