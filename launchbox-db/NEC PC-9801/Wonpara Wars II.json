{"altername_name": [], "name": "Wonpara Wars II", "overview": "The protagonist of the first game, Leopard Chateau-Lyon, finds himself wandering in a forest, having no memory of his own past, except his name. He is captured by two female warriors and is brought to their queen. It appears that there are only women in this country; when the hero says he is a man, the queen rejoices, telling him about an ancient legend that prophesied the advent of a creature named man, who will save their country from the ruthless queen of the neighboring land. The hero has to prove himself worthy of his heroic status and to defeat the enemy forces that threaten the country. Wonpara Wars II follows the same principle as its predecessor: defeat the enemy army in chess-like battles, watch the cut scene, advance to the next stage. The rules for the board game itself are more complex. There are new pieces, taken from Western chess (knight) as well as original ones (ninja). The rules differ from known chess variants in several ways (random treasure chests can change the movement rules of a piece; many types of pieces can move only forward, etc.). The pieces also differ by gender: knights look like men, bishops like women, etc. Each army has a \"master\" piece, which represents the hero and the enemy general, correspondingly. Once a general is captured, the battle is won. There are also unique enemy pieces, one for each battle. Like the first game, capturing an enemy piece is accompanied by hentai pictures. Since there are male and female pieces, different pictures are displayed depending on which player piece has performed the capture.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "March 10, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Mink", "publishers": "Mink", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "0.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137701-wonpara-wars-ii\n"}
