The contents varies from a child story about the kitten if woman is chosen to the nursing story about the hospital if an old man is chosen. The stories are short and vary in quality. But the heroines are cute and even H scenes are well done. What's especially good is that difficulty level is not high and there are only 3-4 commands available at a time.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "December 1, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Game Technopolis", "publishers": "Game Technopolis", "genres": "Visual Novel", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/142168-otome-party\n"}
