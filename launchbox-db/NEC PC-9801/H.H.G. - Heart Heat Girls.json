{"altername_name": [], "name": "H.H.G.: Heart Heat Girls", "overview": "H.H.G. is set in a futuristic world, in which humans co-exists with androids, highly advanced cybernetic organisms. However, this co-existence is anything but peaceful, since androids are going rampant, and a special police force known as ACP (\"Anti Criminal-cyborg Police\") is specifically assigned to deal with them. Two young and lovely police officers, Angelica and Apple, receive a S.O.S. signal from two army pilots, who were attacked by a mysterious female cyborg who called herself Patricia von Kreuzel. Upon arriving at the crime scene, the heroines find no survivors. Together with their colleague, a young detective named Keith, they must investigate and solve this case. Despite the title, the game focuses on the depiction of the futuristic world and detective/mystery narrative much more than on display of attractive young women. The game focuses on text and story-related information rather than interaction; whenever it is possible to interact with the environment, the player (controlling Keith) is usually confined to one screen. Clicking on various objects/people on the screen calls forth a menu with verb commands, but usually only one or two are present (\"Examine\" or \"Talk\"). Examining all or most of the objects triggers the advancement of the story.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "December 2, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Cat's Pro", "publishers": "Cat's Pro", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/c0E-IwsYZgI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137287-hhg-heart-heat-girls\n"}
