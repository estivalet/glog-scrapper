{"altername_name": ["Kounai Shasei 2"], "name": "Kounai Shasei Vol.2", "overview": "As hero returns the fee to the town chief he hears a story about a masked girl who attacks men at night. He is promissed 50,000 yen if he brings the chief the mask taken from the girl. And so the hunt starts. Based on manga. Being a part of Kounai Shasei series there's no doubt it falls into another bakage H plotline. But at least it's an attempt to put up a coherent story and not just throw in a bunch of mini-stories.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "July 26, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "FairyTale", "publishers": "FairyTale", "genres": "Visual Novel", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.88", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/141584-kounai-shasei-vol2\n"}
