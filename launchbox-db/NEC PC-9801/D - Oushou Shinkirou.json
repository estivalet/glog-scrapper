{"altername_name": [], "name": "D: Oushou Shinkirou", "overview": "D: \u014csh\u016b Shinkir\u014d is a turn-based strategy war game set during the time of World War II. The player can select one of the available five scenarios: \"Second Great European War\" (that's the way the game calls what is usually referred to as World War II, 1939-1946), \"World War\" (1942-1946), \"Invasion of Poland\" (1939), \"Operation Barbarossa\" (invasion of Soviet Union, 1941), and \"D-Day\" (invasion of Normandy, 1944) The player can choose to control one of the following armies: Germany, England, USA, and Soviet Union (naturally, not all of them are available in each scenario). The player can compete against up to 3 computer opponents. Each scenario begins with a historical event that led to its existence; afterwards, the player is free to re-write or change history his/her own way. Beside the actual strategic war gameplay, the game also includes diplomacy options (such as asking another country for support, signing an agreement, etc.) Events occur as a result of the player's action (cities captured and destroyed, countries capitulating, etc.) The player moves the units over the top-down map; a battle occurs when the player's and enemy units are in proximity. Battles are displayed graphically, but evolve automatically, without the player's input. The player needs to calculate the amount, strength, and type of units (infantry, tank, planes, etc.), weighing the pros and contras of engaging the enemy to secure victory.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "August 10, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Wolf Team", "publishers": "Wolf Team", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137122-d-oushou-shinkirou\n"}
