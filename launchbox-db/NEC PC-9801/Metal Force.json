{"altername_name": [], "name": "Metal Force", "overview": "Metal Force is a vertical shoot'em up developed by Chime for the pc 9801and published by You En Tai. The whole game has 8 levels. There are 3 kinds of power ups: 1) vulcan (wide shot) 2) Laser (strong and straight) 3) homing bullets You can switch between them. Moreover you can use a speed burst like the one in rayxanber. This a very nice shooter with good graphics and music . There is a bad dump of this game floating around, with no music. You should set the sound board to \"Speak Board\" in neko emulator otherwise the game could crash.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Chime", "publishers": "You-en-tai", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38AaR1xeP-E", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/96016-metal-force\n"}
