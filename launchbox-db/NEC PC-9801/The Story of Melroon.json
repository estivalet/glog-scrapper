{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Story of Melroon", "overview": "The story of Melroon is quite simple and similar to a fairy tale: the old king of Melroon has a 19-year-old daughter, and it's time to choose a husband for her. Two princes have arrived to claim her hand. Instead of asking the princess which one she wants to marry (if any), the king decides that her future husband will be the one who finds the seven great treasures scattered across the land. The player assumes the control over one of the princes, trying to fulfill this request and embrace the sweet burden of matrimony. The Story of Melroon is similar to older Zelda games in that most of the gameplay takes place in top-down, somewhat maze-like areas (mostly outdoor), with enemies wandering around, who must be fought in real-time combat. The hero can visit friendly areas (that use a side-scrolling view), enter houses, buy items and weapons. The RPG element is heavier than in Zelda games, since the hero can also level up in this game.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "dB-SOFT", "publishers": "dB-Soft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137638-the-story-of-melroon\n"}
