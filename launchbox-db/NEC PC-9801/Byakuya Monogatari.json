{"altername_name": [], "name": "Byakuya Monogatari", "overview": "College student Hiroyuki Sato came to a hot spring resort and was shocked by western type mansion known as witch's house and decided to sneak in. This is a museum horror game inside a mansion, but also with comedy elements. It's command selection with verbs selected from vertical row with 2 and 8 keys and nouns selected from horizontal rows with 4 and 6 keys. I tried to bruteforce commands as usual, but I spent over 10 minutes on the 2nd scene and was not able to move on... this game is the hell for bruteforcing. The game is reported to feature battles inside the mansion and multiple endings, especially bad endings.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "November 11, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "East Cube", "publishers": "East Cube", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/dApAakmeszs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/139579-byakuya-monogatari\n"}
