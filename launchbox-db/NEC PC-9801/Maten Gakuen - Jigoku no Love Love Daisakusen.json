{"altername_name": [], "name": "Maten Gakuen: Jigoku no Love Love Daisakusen", "overview": "The tribe of demons dwells above the Himalaya mountains. The demon king Zenon is harboring a plan to occupy the Earth and subdue the humans under his yoke. But first, following a demonic ritual, he sends his son to a Japanese private high school. With his side-kick Zabo, who can miraculously change forms and genders, the young demon offspring is incarnated in a human form and has to deal with the hormonal problems most human teenagers suffer from. Maten Gakuen is a Japanese-style adventure. The player interacts with the environment by choosing commands corresponding to looking, listening, and moving (though in the game they are called \"Devil Eye\", \"Devil Ear\", and \"Devil Move\", respectively). Most of the time selecting these commands prompts the player to choose objects to interacts with from a menu list.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "December 13, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Birdy Soft", "publishers": "Birdy Soft", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137457-maten-gakuen-jigoku-no-love-love-daisakusen\n"}
