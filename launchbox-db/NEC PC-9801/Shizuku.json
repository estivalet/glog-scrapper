{"altername_name": [], "name": "Shizuku", "overview": "Yusuke Nagase is an ordinary Japanese teenager who goes to high school. Lately, however, he has been experiencing something quite out of ordinary: he would see dreams and visions full of violence and rape scenes. Yusuke doesn't understand what is happening to him. The only grown-up he trusts is his uncle, who works as a teacher in the same school. Every step he makes leads to potential danger, and Yusuke must be very careful as he attempts to get to the bottom of the mystery and separate dream from reality. Shizuku is a visual novel. The game consists of still images (usually with photorealistic backgrounds and anime-style character graphics) with text superimposed on them. The player's interaction is confined to scrolling through the text and occasionally helping Yusuke to make a choice. Depending on these choices, the game's story might go in a different direction, or end prematurely.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "January 26, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Leaf", "publishers": "Leaf", "genres": "Visual Novel", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133567-shizuku\n"}
