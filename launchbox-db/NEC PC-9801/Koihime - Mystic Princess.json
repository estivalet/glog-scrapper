{"altername_name": [], "name": "Koihime: Mystic Princess", "overview": "The hero of the game is a young man who has left his home village when he was six. He remembers four little girls who cried when he left - the most vivid memory of his childhood. Ten years later, he returns to the village to visit his grandmother. The four girls are still there - grown up, looking differently, but still remembering him. But each one of them has a secret, which requires the hero to enter the realm of the supernatural - and perhaps find his true love... Mystic Princess has elements of a \"regular\" Japanese-style adventure (interaction possibilities in form of menu-based verb-object combinations), as well as a visual novel (decision-making, different endings). There are also a few places with \"pseudo-RPG\" turn-based combat, though the main bulk of the game is still dedicated to reading text and \"triggering\" the narrative. The game has scenes with explicit nudity and sexual situations, usually of a rather \"softcore\" nature.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "May 26, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Silky's", "publishers": "Silky's", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137397-koihime-mystic-princess\n"}
