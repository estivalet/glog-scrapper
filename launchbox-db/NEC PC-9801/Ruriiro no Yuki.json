{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ruriiro no Yuki", "overview": "The protagonist of the game is a high school student who has lost his parents in a car accident. Living with foster parents was difficult, and he decided to rent the room in the house that once belonged to his real parents, feeling that their spirits will become closer to him that way. However, shortly thereafter the boy started seeing strange dreams. Upon his arrival he discovered a jar in a hole underneath the floor in his room, and that jar miraculously produced a young woman named Ruri (which means \"lapis lazuli\"), who becomes a part of his life in a way he would never expect. Ruriiro no Yuki plays mostly like a visual novel with light simulation elements. Though certain events will occur regardless of the player's actions, much of the plot is determined by decisions taken by the player, which may include locations to visit or actions to choose when prompted. The game has an internal clock, with each visit to a location occupying a fixed segment of time. The player can also choose to advance the clock in most cases. The game follows the protagonist's daily life, usually beginning with school and evolving into whatever the player may choose - staying at home all day, doing homework, going outside, and so on. Depending on these choices the protagonist will have different relationships with the game's female characters. The game contains scenes with explicit nudity, but they can normally only be achieved by following specific paths through the story and pursuing a relationship in a focused way.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "March 7, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "AIL", "publishers": "AIL", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133419-ruriiro-no-yuki\n"}
