{"altername_name": [], "name": "Branmarker 2", "overview": "Branmarker 2 is a direct sequel to the first Branmarker. The heroine Shami has completed her quest, received the magical artifact known as \"branmarker\", and is returning home with her companion Viga. Alas, the evil sorceress Kara has other plans, so she steals the branmarker from Shami to use it for her own mysterious purposes. Shami and Viga have to find the thief and recover the artifact before hell is unleashed upon the world. Like its predecessor, the game is a traditional Japanese-style RPG: the party roams a top-down world map, fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat and exploring maze-like dungeons. As opposed to the previous game, there are several towns to visit, as well as a larger amount of dungeons. The battles are viewed from top-down perspective instead of the original's first-person. Similarly to the preceding game, the party consists of only two active combatants; however, additional characters may replace Shami or Viga during the course of the game. The sequel also adds mouse support, a larger variety of spells and items, and the possibility to save anywhere. Like the first game, Branmarker 2 has erotic cutscenes in anime style. The CD version features full voice-overs for the dialogues.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "July 28, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "D.O.", "publishers": "D.O.", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133263-branmarker-2\n"}
