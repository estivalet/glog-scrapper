An era of relative peace and stability followed, which soon was disrupted by armed conflicts between different countries and internal turmoil on Marmo. Like its predecessor, the game is a Western-style role-playing game, its Japanese origins and anime aesthetics notwithstanding. Visually and gameplay-wise, it is very similar to the previous game. The player creates a party of heroes (up to six active characters), selecting between four races and seven classes. The party is then free to explore much of the continent in a non-linear fashion, visiting towns and exploring pseudo-3D first-person maze-like dungeons. Combat engine is identical to that of the preceding game. Compared to the first game there is a larger overworld, more dungeons, more guilds and sub-quests, as well as several NPCs for hire in the first town.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "December 21, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Humming Bird Soft", "publishers": "Humming Bird Soft", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133771-record-of-lodoss-war-ii-goshiki-no-maryuu\n"}
