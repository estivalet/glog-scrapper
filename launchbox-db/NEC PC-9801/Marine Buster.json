{"altername_name": [], "name": "Marine Buster", "overview": "Marine Buster is a turn-based strategy game that builds upon the rules of the popular board game BattleShip. The basic principle is the same as in BattleShip: players position ships on a board and then take turns attacking enemy ships by guessing their location on the opponent's board. The game offers several types of ships as well as weapon variants with limited amounts of ammo and different damage properties. Erotic pictures serve as a reward for successfully defeating the opponent.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "March 18, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Silky's", "publishers": "Silky's", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133378-marine-buster\n"}
