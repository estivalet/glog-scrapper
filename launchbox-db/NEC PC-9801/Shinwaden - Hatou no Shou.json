{"altername_name": [], "name": "Shinwaden: Hatou no Shou", "overview": "In the beginning of 23rd century, Japan has turned into a huge megalopolis. More and more urban areas were built. The largest building of all times was erected in Osaka and named \"Atlas Tower\". But the day before the opening ceremony, two mysterious characters appear in front of the tower - a demonic-looking man and woman. The man, who calls himself Tanoma, announces that \"their time has finally come\". It's up to the young amateur detective Naruto to unravel this mystery, and prevent a terrible disaster. Shinwaden: Hatou no Shou is an adventure game. True to its Japanese origins, the game has no inventory management, puzzles, dialogue trees, or other elements of a Western adventure. However, unlike most Japanese adventures, Shinwaden: Hatou no Shou has real physical movement. Most of the game is spent navigating the top-down districts of Osaka, entering buildings, and talking to people, trying to advance the plot. Only a few occasions feature the traditional still \"Look/Talk/Think\" menu. There are some scenes with nudity in the game.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "July 15, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Great", "publishers": "Great", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137611-shinwaden-hatou-no-shou\n"}
