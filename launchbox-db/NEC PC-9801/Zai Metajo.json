{"altername_name": [], "name": "Zai Metajo", "overview": "Zai Metajo is the second part of the story described in Metajo. This time, the player controls a group of secret agents within the students committee of the Girls High School attached to the Meta-Topology University, led by Yurika Asano. Endowed with special powers, the girls try to protect the integrity of the school against opponents of meta-topology, as well as possible traitors within their own ranks. Gameplay-wise, this chapter is nearly identical to the first one, relying on the same tactical RPG template with melee attacks and special meta-topology powers. The game offers a few more branching missions, slight interface changes, and the possibility to gamble at a casino.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "December 20, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "R-Force Software", "publishers": "Anjin", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137726-zai-metajo\n"}
