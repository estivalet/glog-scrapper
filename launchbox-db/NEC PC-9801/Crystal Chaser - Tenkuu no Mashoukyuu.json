{"altername_name": [], "name": "Crystal Chaser: Tenkuu no Mashoukyuu", "overview": "For a long time, five magical crystal orbs have been protecting our universe. One of them was hidden on the Earth. But there was a young woman who desired too much power, and she came to the Earth in order to harvest the power of its crystal for her selfish purposes. The only ones who can stop her are Takanoshin, the son of a samurai warrior, and the young girl Noichigo, who teaches little children. Together, they embark on a long and perilous journey through the land of Japan... The game's setting is modern-day Japan with many anachronistic medieval-like elements. Despite its RPG-like plot and unusual perspective (effectively third-person, since the player-controlled characters are visible on the screen at all times), Crystal Chaser is an adventure game. The player mostly controls Takanoshin and Noichigo (often together as a \"party\"), but sometimes switches to other characters. The game has no real puzzles, and the entire interaction (including moving) is done via selecting commands in a menu; however, compared to most other Japanese adventures, the game contains more interaction, including inventory item usage.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "June 15, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Telenet Japan", "publishers": "Telenet Japan", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/byIRwELEZIw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/139353-crystal-chaser-tenkuu-no-mashoukyuu\n"}
