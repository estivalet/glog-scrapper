{"altername_name": [], "name": "Regional Power III", "overview": "Regional Power III is a space strategy game. The player can either create an own scenario in a randomly generated map (setting the values for the number of planets and difficulty), or follow the campaign mode consisting of several scenarios, the first of which is set in the Tullaze star system and puts the player in control of the nascent Toran Federation. There is no option to select a scenario from the campaign directly from the main menu. The game is very similar to its predecessor visually as well as gameplay-wise. The interface is nearly identical, though a few adjustments and refinements have been made: for example, planet surfaces are more detailed, and there are more precise options for colonization, construction, spaceship customization and research. The most noticeable choice is the addition of a new group in the command menu, which deals with interplanetary construction in player-controlled space, such as for example transportation routes between planets.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "December 22, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Cosmos Computer", "publishers": "Cosmos Computer", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/zghRo1rN01M", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/136574-regional-power-iii\n"}
