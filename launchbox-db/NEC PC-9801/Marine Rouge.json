{"altername_name": [], "name": "Marine Rouge", "overview": "A young man named Kenji decides to have a vacation on the beautiful island together with his sister Hiromi. Taking a break from work and worries, the two discover a tourist resort with lovely beaches and high-class hotels. Very soon Kenji finds out that many attractive young women either work on the island or have come there for various reasons. Soon the holiday turns into a never-ending string of sexual escapades - and perhaps one of them will turn into a true romance? Marine Rouge is a Japanese-style adventure game. The player interacts with the environments by selecting commands, which include Look, Talk, Think, and Move. Object sub-menus appear very rarely; for the most part it is necessary to exhaust all possible choices to complete an event (usually a dialogue) and return to the limited freedom of choosing different locations to visit. Depending on these choices, the game will trigger different scenes, eventually shifting towards different endings.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "September 29, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Discovery", "publishers": "Discovery", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133379-marine-rouge\n"}
