{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mole Mole", "overview": "Mole Mole is a puzzle game in which the player has to navigate a rather anthropomorphic mole through side-view single-screen stages, with the goal of reaching the exit after having collected all the fruits on the screen. The mole can climb the stairs scattered around the levels, or dig tunnels in any direction except upwards. All the levels also include boulders, which will fall down if disturbed by the mole's burrowing activities. As opposed to Boulder Dash variants, the boulders cannot kill the mole or harm him in any way; it is impossible to \"die\" in the game. However, unless the player calculates the moves with extreme precision, getting irrevocably stuck and restarting the level is a common occurrence. The player can start from any of the 45 levels, arranged in order of ascending difficulty. There is also an editor that allows the players to create their own levels.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "August 1, 1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Cross Media Soft", "publishers": "Cross Media Soft", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/154791-mole-mole\n"}
