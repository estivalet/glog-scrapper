{"altername_name": [], "name": "Wonpara Wars", "overview": "God has created a paradise called Wandante. Men, women, and animals lived together in peace. But where there is God, there is also Devil; where there is love, there is also hatred. The hatred between men and women grew, until it resulted in a bloody war. Having superior physical strength, men were victorious for a while - until female demons offered their help to women's army. Men's army was nearly destroyed. It was at that time that the hero, named Leopard Chateau-Lyon, appeared in Wandante. He is the only hope of the men, the one who will have to defeat the demonic women and to bring peace to both genders. Wonpara Wars is a strategy board game which is somewhat similar to chess, but with much simpler rules (and decidedly much simpler than the Japanese chess, shogi). Some pieces are identical to those of Western chess (bishop), or move similarly to Western chess pieces, but have different names (\"magicians\" who move similarly to rooks); \"soldiers\" can walk in all directions, including backwards. There are also treasure chess scattered around the board, which can be captured by both the player's and the enemy army. The battles are dictated by the plot; there are cut scenes before and after each battle, and they take place in different locations. The enemy army has a \"boss\" piece, unique for each battle. The battle is won when one of the sides has captured enough enemy pieces. Whenever the player's piece captures an enemy piece, a hentai scene occurs, typically showing a girl taking off her battle clothes.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "March 31, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mink", "publishers": "Mink", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/tTatMfEKnS4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137700-wonpara-wars\n"}
