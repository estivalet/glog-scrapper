{"altername_name": [], "name": "Idaten Ikase Otoko 2: Jinsei no Imi", "overview": "The hero is a Korean wrestler who has been working in a Brazilian farm and now comes to Japan without the proper knowledge of the language. He has an ability to excite girls with random phrases alone. The theme of the second work is \"life\". The game starts with the first newly wed pair night and follows through other married couple and their future children situations - using random phrases resolves all those situations one by one. The meaning of the work is to read funny phrases from words that are set to numbers. The phrases are refined even further. It's a bakage so some situations are superficial here. Useless for people who could not understand the charm of the prequel.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "November 10, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Family Soft", "publishers": "Family Soft", "genres": "Visual Novel", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/142045-idaten-ikase-otoko-2-jinsei-no-imi\n"}
