{"altername_name": [], "name": "H+", "overview": "The title H+ is rather self-explanatory to those who understand the meaning of the letter \"H\" to the Japanese (pronounced \"ecchi\", it basically refers to all things sexual). The game consists of three unrelated stories, all of which can be played directly from the main menu: The first story is a rather mundane tale of a boy and a girl who meet outside and head to the girl's apartment; thanks to the hero's irresistible charm (with a bit of help from alcoholic beverages), the two are able to engage in a variety of sexual acts. The protagonist of the second story is an aspiring journalist, who is given the task to interview a famous female movie star. The interview begins with taking pictures of the celebrity wearing different costumes, and ends with her removing those costumes and performing activities which turn into a blockbuster porn movie. The third story is dedicated to the obligatory \"little girl\", a female high-school student. There are two possible scenarios, both involving seduction of the poor girl: one involves a sexy female teacher, the other an older male schoolmate. The gameplay is identical in all three scenarios, and is that of a visual novel combined with some point-and-click activities. The player first chooses the correct approaches to win the favors of the female counterparts, while the more physical part of the seduction involves clicking on various parts of the partner's body in order to trigger the next scene.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "July 23, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Desire", "publishers": "Desire", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137277-h\n"}
