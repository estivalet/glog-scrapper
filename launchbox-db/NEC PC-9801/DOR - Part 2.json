{"altername_name": ["DOR 2"], "name": "DOR: Part 2", "overview": "The sequel to DOR is structured exactly the same way as the first game: play any of the three unrelated scenarios, accessible directly from the main menu. The first scenario takes the player into France of 16th century, during a witch hunt. The playable character is a young girl who is falsely accused of being a witch and is taken into a dungeon, interrogated, and tortured. The second scenario follows the adventures of a young boy who has lost his way in a forest. Suddenly he meets a cute little female elf, who is willing to help him find the right way, in exchange for some other favors... The third scenario is named \"Armored Fighter Gyleban\" and is in a way a parody on sci-fi anime movies. The player controls a commander of a unit of female fighters with enhanced abilities, that must stop an evil organization from conquering our world. Like in the first DOR, the gameplay is limited to selecting actions/answers from a menu at each screen. Correctly chosen actions will advance the story, while wrong ones will lead to a premature ending.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "May 19, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "D.O.", "publishers": "D.O.", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133310-dor-part-2\n"}
