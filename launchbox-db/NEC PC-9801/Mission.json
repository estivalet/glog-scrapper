{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mission", "overview": "In the end of 21st century, a devastating war destroyed most of human civilization. Thousand years have passed since. The humans had to re-build their civilization, and religion played an important part in the new world. A new religion, which claimed to be \"the faith of love\", began to spread through the world. Joe, a young and enthusiastic female knight and preacher, heads to a remote village in order to convert the non-believers to the new religion. But will her own faith be challenged when she discovers the truth about our world?.. Mission is a Japanese-style RPG, with most characteristic ingredients such as top-down world map navigation, linear story, simple combat mechanics, automatic leveling up, etc. Unlike most Japanese RPGs of the time, the enemies are visible walking on the world map and in dungeons; contact with enemies initiates a battle. A somewhat unusual feature is the necessity to choose participants (both enemy and player-controlled) before every battle, which then turns into a one-on-one turn-based fight.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "March 17, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Great", "publishers": "Great", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/134322-mission\n"}
