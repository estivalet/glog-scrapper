{"altername_name": ["Mahjong Gensoukyoku III"], "name": "Mahjong Fantasia the 3rd Stage", "overview": "The third installment of the Mahjong Fantasia series is not directly related story-wise to its predecessors. In the story mode, the player assumes the role of Chris, a guard in the city of Burgund. His mission is to protect the princess at all costs, but once the city is destroyed by members of a cult known as Valms, the two of them have to flee. Chris finds out that the only way to restore his homeland is by finding a sacred ring that had been kept in secret for many generations. The gameplay of the story mode retains the formula of the previous entries, essentially being a collection of mahjong games with long cut-scenes between them. The other game modes from the previous games are present here as well: versus mode, which allows the player to play against mahjong opponents of his choice, \"vs. computer\" mode, and training mode.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "August 25, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Active Software", "publishers": "Active Software", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133375-mahjong-fantasia-the-3rd-stage\n"}
