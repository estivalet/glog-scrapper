Navigating the girls on the field, the player can attack monsters when they are in range of the girls' weapons. There are no special attacks or any attack animations; however, the game will randomly display a sexual torture scene depicting a monster raping a girl during battles. Between the battles, the player can sometimes choose to chat with the girls, which occasionally leads to a sex scene.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "September 17, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "D.O.", "publishers": "D.O.", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137694-youjuu-senki-ad-2048\n"}
