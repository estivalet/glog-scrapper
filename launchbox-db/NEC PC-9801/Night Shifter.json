{"altername_name": [], "name": "Night Shifter", "overview": "Once upon a time, there was a young boy who loved motorcycles. Riding through the night on his bike was what he enjoyed most - until one night he crashed into a car, and was taken to hospital. There, he wakes up to find out that he'll have to go through some injections and infusions, which scares him so much that he faints... and immediately finds himself mysterious transported to a bizarre magical realm, somewhat inspired by Alice in Wonderland, with well-dressed rabbits, smoking caterpillars, but also plenty of cute girls. It turns out that this Wonderland isn't that bad - but how hard will it be to conquer the hearts of its pretty inhabitants?.. Night Shifter is an adventure game. Although it was made by a Japanese company, it has elements of a Western adventure. The gameplay emphasizes exploration and conversation choices. The hero can move through top-down locations. When he reaches a place of interest, the perspective switches to first-person, displaying menu-based commands. A stand-out feature of the game is the possibility to play it in either Lawful or Chaotic ways. Most of the locations in the two play modes overlap, but the starting locations and many events are completely different. The player can choose Lawful or Chaotic path from the main menu; it is impossible to change it afterwards.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "September 10, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Four-Nine", "publishers": "Four-Nine", "genres": "Visual Novel", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "0.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/142086-night-shifter\n"}
