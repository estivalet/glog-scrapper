{"altername_name": ["Mahjong Fantasia the 2nd stage", "Mahjong Gensoukyoku II"], "name": "Mahjong Fantasia II", "overview": "Mahjong Fantasia 2 is a direct sequel to the first Mahjong Fantasia game. The story mode begins with a reminiscence of the events depicted in the first game. The hero, Ring, is back with his girlfriend Tania, but mourns the loss of the lovely elf Raspberry. He travels to the Village of Elves, where he discovers that there might be a way to resurrect Raspberry - but it involved finding seven sacred golden tablets, guarded by fearsome opponents, which must be defeated in a game of mahjong... Like its predecessor, Mahjong Fantasia 2 focuses on mahjong games, with extensive cut-scenes between them, and parts that have interaction in Japanese adventure-style, with menu-based verb commands to advance the plot. The game also has a versus mode, which allows to play mahjong against various characters from the story mode, a \"vs. computer\" mode, and a new training mode, which explains in detail the rules of mahjong. Just like the first game, Mahjong Fantasia 2 features an all-female opponent cast. Cut-scenes with explicit nudity appear after the mahjong victories.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "August 6, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Active Software", "publishers": "Active Software", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133472-mahjong-fantasia-ii\n"}
