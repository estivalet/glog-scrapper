{"altername_name": ["Kyouiku Jiyushikoosei Maniacs"], "name": "Kyouiku Jisshuu: Joshikousei Maniacs", "overview": "The plot of Ky\u014diku Jissh\u016b: Joshi K\u014dsei Maniacs is rather simple: the protagonist is an ordinary Japanese man named Shingo, who is about to become an intern in a prestigious school. There is only one thing that makes the young man slightly nervous: all his students will be girls. And if that weren't enough, some of his new co-workers are young attractive women. Will Shingo concentrate on his job or succumb to the pleasures of the flesh? The game is a very simple, low-interaction Japanese adventure. Every screen has four commands: \"Look\", \"Talk\", \"Move\", and - depending on the context - \"Teach\" or \"Go Home\". Each day is divided into morning and afternoon sections. The player must repeatedly visit different locations in the school in order to trigger events and advance the story.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "December 13, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tetratech", "publishers": "Tetratech", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137404-kyouiku-jisshuu-joshikousei-maniacs\n"}
