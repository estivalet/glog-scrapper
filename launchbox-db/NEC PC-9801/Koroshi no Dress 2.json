{"altername_name": [], "name": "Koroshi no Dress 2", "overview": "Hero is a detective who receives a strange request to fake marry a beautiful client woman. But during the wedding she gets killed by someone. Hero starts to investigate her circle of friends and acquaintances. The first part was an adult work with gore and violence but was hardly erotic at all. This work pushes H events everywhere - it even starts with one that has no significance for the story at all. Scenario part is short and there is also lesser mystery element since we investigate a circle of people and get involved in crime syndicate dealings. Many game elements have evolved, but the the impression and the impact grew thin.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "September 12, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "FairyTale", "publishers": "Kirara", "genres": "Visual Novel", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/141250-koroshi-no-dress-2\n"}
