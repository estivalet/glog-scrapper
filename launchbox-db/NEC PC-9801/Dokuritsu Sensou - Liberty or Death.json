{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dokuritsu Sensou: Liberty or Death", "overview": "The European Wars against Spain and France have been costly to the British Empire. In order to gain additional funds for the war effort, the Crown raise taxes from the New World colonies without representation. This act compels the New World colonies to protest and boycott against British rule. By 1775, the Crown alarmed by the protests, boycotts and politically instability in the New World sends troops to subdue any rebellious efforts by the New World colonists. This threatening approach provokes the Thirteen Colonies to revolt. Thus starts the War for Independence in the New World (American Revolutionary War). In Liberty or Death, you partake in the American Revolutionary War, either as the \"rebels\" - the American Continental Army or as the \"Crown\" - the British Royal Army. Choosing either one of the nations will prompt you to choose the leading Commander-in-Chief: The Continental Army: Charles Lee, Artemas Ward or George Washington. The British Royal Army: Henry Clinton, Thomas Gage or William Howe.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "September 27, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Koei", "publishers": "Koei", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_or_Death_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137682-dokuritsu-sensou-liberty-or-death\n"}
