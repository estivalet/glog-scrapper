{"altername_name": ["Shuten D\u014dji"], "name": "Shuten Douji", "overview": "A young modern-day Japanese couple was paying their respects to the dead in a cemetery near a temple, when they witnessed a battle between two fearsome demons. One of them emerged victorious, and placed a little baby boy at the feet of the terrified couple.The demons asked the humans to raise this boy as their own, and to protect him until he turns fifteen... And soon after his fifteenth birthday, Jirou - who knew about his demonic heritage from his foster parents - had to fight for his life, as demons invaded his school, shape-shifting into his friends and relatives. Jirou had no chance but to awaken his innate demonic powers, and now he must find a way to deal with his past and take part in a new battle of the demonic world... Shuten D\u014dji is a RPG of the Japanese template (random enemies, simple turn-based engine, automatic leveling up, etc.), with some typical elements reduced or removed: no \"world map\", only one kind of magical attack (called \"ESP\"), and limited control over the few party members. The battles are viewed from first-person perspective. There are graphical images with nudity in the game, but no explicit sex scenes.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Enix Corporation", "publishers": "Enix Corporation", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133435-shuten-douji\n"}
