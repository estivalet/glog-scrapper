Ten years later, the Zentradi, a race of proxy warriors serving the ancient Protoculture, encountered the humans during an enemy pursuit. Led by the relentless Britai Kridanki, the Zentradi forces initiate a Space War, trying to harness the humans' nuclear technology. Ch\u014d Jik\u016b Y\u014dsai Macross: Remember Me is based on the anime series Macross. It is a turn-based strategy game in which the player controls an army of space vehicles and mechs operated by humans navigating the giant starship SDF-1 Macross. The game develops linearly, with cutscenes featuring main characters from the anime taking place between and during missions. The player has to outfit Macross with mechs, ships, and weapons before each mission. Afterwards, the player positions the combatants on the battle field. The player then navigates ships and mechs on the screen, engaging enemy craft in combat. Combat sequences proceed automatically, and are displayed as animated sequences.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "March 19, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Family Soft", "publishers": "Family Soft", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/141935-the-super-dimension-fortress-macross-remember-me\n"}
