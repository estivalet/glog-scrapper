{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ikazuchi no Senshi Raidy", "overview": "A young sexy female warrior Raidi has come to a village whose inhabitants were abducted by young sexy female... demons. The demons imprisoned them in a huge tower. Raidi decides to enter the tower and to free the prisoners. Ikazuchi no Senshi Raidi is a rather basic dungeon-crawler with a twist: hentai. The enemies in the game are female (demonic female, but female nevertheless); when Raidi defeats them, they lose their clothes. There are also event scenes that contain sexual images. The gameplay involves Raidi moving through pseudo-3D environments and defeating enemies in turn-based combat. The only location in the game is the tower; there are no \"friendly\" areas and no possibility to acquire weapons, equipment, or items but by finding them in the tower or having them randomly dropped by enemies.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "September 20, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "ZyX", "publishers": "ZyX", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137315-ikazuchi-no-senshi-raidy\n"}
