{"altername_name": [], "name": "Imitation wa Aisenai", "overview": "In near future women fertility deceased and \"imitation women\" were created for this purpose. 20 years later the fertility values normalized and \"imitation women\" lost their existence value. Android women were all stunning beauties, so women organizations conspired to eliminate this threat. Hero is a first class android hunter D who is now given a new task to find three runaway imitation women. Remake of Imitation City of 1987 and probably the most impressive SF story of the 80s. It's difficult to sympathize with D at first as he ruthlessly kills the unarmed and begging for mercy imitation women, but little by little we get to know that he does not have memories of the past and eventually he finds out that his own lover is also an imitation woman and is queued for elimination. The sound in this work fits brilliantly. On the shortcomings side the character design is somewhat shabby. That actually may be for the best since we have to kill so many androids - it's as if saying that it's a scenario oriented hard-boiled work and if you're looking for H look elsewhere.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Great", "publishers": "Great", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/139247-imitation-wa-aisenai\n"}
