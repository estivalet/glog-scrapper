{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ms. Detective #1: Iwami Ginzan Satsujin Jiken", "overview": "Chisato Higari is a detective to receive a request to find client's missing father. You get to know that father is in Omori but when you get there there is a news report about his death and at the same time your client disappears. Is the corpse floating in the sea of Japan truly client's father? Where did the client disappear? Point and click adventure with live-action videos, so can be also described as interactive movie. Game had quite a big impact since it was the first game to have videos inserted and to have sound synchronized with the video. Local town locations are also represented truthfully. What hurs the game a lot is small picture/video size and constant repeats of videos on the same actions, like a car moving to some location.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "April 17, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "DataWest", "publishers": "DataWest", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/140774-ms-detective-1-iwami-ginzan-satsujin-jiken\n"}
