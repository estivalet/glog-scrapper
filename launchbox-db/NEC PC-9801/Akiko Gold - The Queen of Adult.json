{"altername_name": [], "name": "Akiko Gold: The Queen of Adult", "overview": "A certain girl's high school has attracted the attention of the authorities: girls are disappearing, and there are rumors of strange cult-like activities going on in the school. Secret service sends a female agent (codename \"Akiko\") to the high school. Posing as an English teacher, Akiko must unravel the mystery - which she eventually does, though not quite the way one would expect from a special agent... The gameplay is very simple Japanese-style adventure: every screen presents a menu of possible verb commands and objects (\"Look at...\", \"Talk about...\", etc.) By going through these commands, the player depletes available actions on the screen and moves to a new one. Sometimes it is possible to move around the school (also via a menu). The game is very heavy on pornographic scenes, mostly depicting lesbian sex.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "December 22, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Red-Zone", "publishers": "FairyTale", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.62", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133251-akiko-gold-the-queen-of-adult\n"}
