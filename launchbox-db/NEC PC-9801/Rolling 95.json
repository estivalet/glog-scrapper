It was released in 1991 with the title \"Rorirori Ringu\", and then renamed to \"ROLLING95\" with the 1995 version upgrade. EASY TRAINING mode has been added to the new version so that you can practice well before the race. There is no fixed goal line in the race, and the rule is to clear the stage if you pass through the specified number of gates within the specified time limit. The operation is rolling to the left and right, and only the accelerator and turbo. With only the accelerator, the maximum speed is 327km / h, and if the turbo is activated from there, the maximum speed reaches 511km / h. The mechanism is that the brake is applied when the accelerator is released. It can be said that it depends on the player's concentration and reflexes whether or not he / she can perform a time trial run while minimizing mistakes in such a high-speed space.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "February 19, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bio_100%", "publishers": "Bio_100%", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106155-rolling-95\n"}
