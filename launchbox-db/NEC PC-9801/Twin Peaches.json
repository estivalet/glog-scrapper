{"altername_name": [], "name": "Twin Peaches", "overview": "The hero of this game is a young lad who leaves his home village on a quest to find a beautiful girl and to marry her. Soon he encounters what might very well be the object of his quest - bathing in a spring in the middle of a forest. Before the hero can say a word, a female demon attacks. The hero scares away the demon, and the lovely girl, who turns out to be Sweet Pea, the daughter of the innkeeper of the village Twin Peaches, takes him to meet his father. But all goes wrong when Sweet Pea's soul gets stolen under mysterious circumstances. The hero descends into the huge underground dungeon in search for answers. And a young nobleman named Dendro, who claims to be Sweet Pea's fiancee, swears to find the soul before the hero does... Twin Peaches is essentially a first-person dungeon crawler. The only movement is possible in the pseudo-3D environments of a huge, maze-like dungeon (with an auto-map feature). The enemies appear randomly; the battles are turn-based. Enemies are mostly young, pretty, female, and scantily clad (sometimes naked). Defeating enemies gives the hero money, experience points, and \"love points\", which increase his performance in battles.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "August 12, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Pinky Soft", "publishers": "Pinky Soft", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137655-twin-peaches\n"}
