{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pink Sox 7", "overview": "Pink Sox 7 is a collection of adult-themed mini-games in various genres. It contains another very short episode in the Halftime Lover series; like in the few previous installments, it is non-interactive. Otherwise all the mini-games in this volume are new. A mini-adventure entitled G Gun-Cannon introduces characters seen in other Pink Sox mini-games before (such as Sayaka from Balancing Beam of Love), and is mostly dedicated to lesbian sex between high school girls. Another very simple Japanese-style adventure is an erotic variation on the Red Riding Hood tale. Finally, there is also a simple slot machine mini-game.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "February 28, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Wendy Magazine", "publishers": "Wendy Magazine", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137713-pink-sox-7\n"}
