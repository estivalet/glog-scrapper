{"altername_name": [], "name": "Savior", "overview": "This is an early adventure game developed by Enix for the NEC PC-98 who\u2019s main selling point was that it contained a lot of animated sequences. For comparison, Square released an adventure game called Will: The Death Trap II the same year who\u2019s animation consisted of the main heroine blinking on the title screen and the sprites flashing different colors or doing other simple animation loops. Savior, on the other, was far more cinematic with characters having a fuller range of movement in certain segments, which must have been very impressive at the time.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Enix Corporation", "publishers": "Enix Corporation", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/LuPq-d-71SA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133513-savior\n"}
