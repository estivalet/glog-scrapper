{"altername_name": [], "name": "Metamorph Meena", "overview": "In Metamorph Meena, the player controls Mai, a little girl who has a crush on an older boy who, naturally, doesn't pay any attention to her. But one day she meets too imp-like creatures, one of whom is Pal, the 153rd prince of a magical world called Dream Star, and the other his court magician Pul. The two turn Mai into an adult young woman and she begins to explore her newly found sexuality... This is a Japanese adventure game with linear story progression. The interaction consists mainly of small command menus, until the heroine becomes intimate with another character. At such times, the interface changes to sexual commands (touch, lick, etc.), which lead to a point-and-click interaction with the partner's body; often the player then assumes the role of Mai's partner, with Mai herself becoming the \"object\".", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "February 18, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Apple Pie", "publishers": "Apple Pie", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137469-metamorph-meena\n"}
