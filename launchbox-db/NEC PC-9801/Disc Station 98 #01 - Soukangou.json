{"altername_name": [], "name": "Disc Station 98 #01: Soukangou", "overview": "Disc Station is a series of disk magazines that were published by Compile. The first set of issues (#0-#32) were released for the MSX from July 1988 to January 1992, while the second set of issues (Vol. 1-Vol. 27) was released for other PCs from October 6, 1993 to June 6, 2000. Each volume of Disc Station contained a variety of software, including demos and even full games. The magazine was originally published entirely on floppy disks for the MSX2, before changing to a print format focused on PC98 and later Windows '95. Several Madou Monogatari- and Puyo Puyo-related games and animated shorts were released in Disc Station. The first PC-98 incarnation of Disc Station, Disc Station 98, initially consisted solely of floppy disks. After a year-long hiatus, Compile would switch to a magazine format with pack-in disks, resetting their volume numbering format in the process. The first volume of the second incarnation of Disc Station released with a 5.25-inch floppy disk, volumes 2-8 used 3.5-inch disks, and the final three volumes used CD-ROMs. This first edition had for example the first of a series of Nazo Puyo puzzles. Similar, but not identical, to the standalone PC-98 game.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "December 11, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Compile", "publishers": "Compile", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/140065-disc-station-98-01-soukangou\n"}
