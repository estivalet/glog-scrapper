{"altername_name": [], "name": "Crystal Dream II: Maou no Genei", "overview": "Once upon a time, there was harmony and balance in the beautiful land of Yugrena. Sky, earth, sea, and man co-existed in peace. But human beings began to exploit the nature for their own needs. The balance was broken. Dark clouds covered the sky; the earth quaked in anger; the sea began to send waves of destruction. Only one man can restore the balance in the world - the legendary hero Grey. Blessed by his wise master, Grey ventures to Yugrena to correct the wrongs. The sequel to Crystal Dream is not directly related to it story-wise, but has the same gameplay system. By using arrow keys, the player can move Grey from a still screen to another. At every screen, it is possible to access a menu with commands, which include looking, talking, and also \"doing the nasty\"; whenever the hero is successful in his sexual exploits, the player gets to see an erotic picture. Enemies can be engaged in turn-based combat, and Grey receives experience points and becomes stronger in a standard RPG fashion.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "March 24, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Striker", "publishers": "Striker", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137107-crystal-dream-ii-maou-no-genei\n"}
