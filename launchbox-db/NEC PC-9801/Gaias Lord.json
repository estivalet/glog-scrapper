{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gaias Lord", "overview": "The hero of this game, named Zenith, has borrowed too much money. The village inhabitants just beat him up, but the village elder has other plans. It appears that several young girls have been missing lately. As a punishment, Zenith must venture to the nearby tower, infested by all kinds of monsters and demons, and see if he could find the girls there. Gaias Lord is an action game with a lot of environmental puzzles, most of which involves pushing crates to clear the way through the top-down dungeon, accessing treasure chests, keys, and other important items. There are also enemies wandering around the tower, whom Zenith can fight in real-time combat, using his sword or special techniques. There are slight RPG elements, as Zenith can equip various weapons and armors scattered through the dungeon. The game has anime-style cut scenes, some of which feature nudity and sexual situations.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Orange House", "publishers": "Orange House", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137208-gaias-lord\n"}
