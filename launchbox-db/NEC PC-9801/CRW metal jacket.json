{"altername_name": [], "name": "CRW metal jacket", "overview": "You command a group of well-armed soldiers through a series of missions, from infiltrating a drug lord's mansion to assassinating the leader of a coup. The game proceeds in real-time, but you can pause the action at any time to give orders for your soldiers to move or attack. Your units can pilot one of three specialized mechs: Attacker, Defender, or Sniper, and your squad leader Reiko has an exclusive Commander mech. Each mech has a special move in addition to attacking or defending, such as the Defender's Search, which reveals a small area of the map from the fog of war.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "October 7, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Team Kikai", "publishers": "Wiz", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106065-crw-metal-jacket\n"}
