{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hanafuda de Pon!", "overview": "The culmination of Active's work with strip hanafuda games, which included the previous two Hanayori Dango games. There are two play modes, a story mode where you pick a magical girl and play your way through a tournament, and a single player against various school girls. In the first mode, either your player or the enemy is disrobed as you lose. This game includes some absolutely, horrifyingly bad compressed voice. I can only hope it's actually an emulation error and not supposed to sound like that. This game later came out in a Windows CD-ROM version, which has full voice acting that sounds fine, but otherwise differs little from the original release. While technically a PC-98 game, the image runs fine under Windows 10 when mounted with a CD emulator.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Active", "publishers": "Active", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/139242-hanafuda-de-pon\n"}
