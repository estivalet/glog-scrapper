{"altername_name": [], "name": "Yesterday", "overview": "In the far future, human beings learned to travel to faraway solar systems; as a result, human civilization has spread across the entire galaxy. However, as they tried to explore the outer space beyond it, they encountered a huge black hole. It was said that a strange light emanated from it. A brave scientist and pilot named Sonya traveled to the black hole, and discovered a medieval-like world, whose inhabitants consider her a divine savior... Despite the side-scrolling perspective for navigation, Yesterday is an RPG without any action elements, similar to its \"sister games\" Caroll and Emerald Densetsu. The player navigates the heroine through vast side-scrolling environment, fighting randomly appearing enemies. During the turn-based battles, the game switches to first-person view. Items and equipment can be bought in friendly areas. Leveling up is automatic; magic spells are learned depending on the protagonist's level.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Zig Zag", "publishers": "New System House Oh!", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/136557-yesterday\n"}
