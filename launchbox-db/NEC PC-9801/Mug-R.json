{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mug-R", "overview": "A young man wakes up and sees a young woman in front of him. She tells him that her name is Crith, and she is the village nurse. The young man tells her that his name is Graffy, and... but that's all he can remember. Just his name, and the name of his cute strange pet animal - Lippen. Crith says that he was found unconscious outside of the village. Graffy is naturally eager to restore his memory, but there is more pressing business: it appears that the gods are angry at the villagers, and demand a human sacrifice, which has to be Crith. Graffy is determined to protect the girl, but there is only one way: to descend into the gods' temples and to find out why they are angry... Mug-R is a first-person dungeon crawler, the gameplay focusing on exploring and mapping (with an automap) the maze-like temples. The party of playable characters - Graffy, Crith, and Lippen - fight randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat. they gain experience points and level up in standard RPG fashion. Other RPG elements are somewhat reduced: there are no magic spells at all, and item usage is limited. The game contains explicit sexual scenes.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "April 22, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Software House Parsley", "publishers": "Software House Parsley", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137481-mug-r\n"}
