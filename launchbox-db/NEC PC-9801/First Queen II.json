{"altername_name": ["First Queen II: Sabaku no Joou"], "name": "First Queen II", "overview": "The second entry in First Queen series is set in a pseudo-historical environment, based on real world countries at the time of Roman Empire, but with anachronisms and fantasy elements. Aleph, the main hero of the game, is a high-ranked officer in the Roman army. He was found unconscious on the sea shore, without any memory of his past. When the country of Frank (sic) plans to rebel against Rome, the emperor sends Aleph on a mission to Alexandria, to convince its king to send his troops to aid Rome in the war. The gameplay system is the same as in the first game, mixing elements of RPG, strategy, and real-time combat: the hero recruits soldiers, the small army roams the world, encountering and fighting large groups of enemies in hostile areas. It is possible to buy and equip items, talk to people, level up, etc., as in a standard RPG; but strategy elements such as recruiting, preparations, and tactics also play a major role.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kure Software Koubou", "publishers": "Kure Software Koubou", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133341-first-queen-ii\n"}
