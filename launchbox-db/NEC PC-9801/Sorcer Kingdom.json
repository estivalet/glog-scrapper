{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sorcer Kingdom", "overview": "Three hundred years ago, a great war consumed the world. It is said that people were using devastating magical spells against each other. But years have passed, and the knowledge of magic was forgotten. Legend persists that somewhere there is the Book of Magic, the greatest treasure anyone could dream of. The legend captivated Nash, a young careless thief who decides to ignore the obvious danger and ventures to the borders of the kingdom in search of the treasure. Naturally, he encounters evil forces who won't let him reach his goal; and that's how the thief turns into a hero who will eventually save the world... Sorcer Kingdom (no relation to the similarly named Genesis/MegaDrive game) can be described as a \"pseudo-RPG\". The premise and the structure of the game (top-down navigation, vast dungeon-like areas, towns, etc.) imply role-playing elements; however, these are too light to consider the game a \"true\" RPG. Rather, it contains exploration segments and dialogue alongside action-based battles. The battles aren't very frequent, and can even be set on auto; they are confined to a small area and are triggered whenever an enemy is near the hero. There are no experience points, equipment, or comparable RPG system. The game contains a few scenes with explicit nudity and sexual situations.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "October 27, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Aypio", "publishers": "Aypio", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/139720-sorcer-kingdom\n"}
