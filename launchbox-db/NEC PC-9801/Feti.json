{"altername_name": [], "name": "Feti", "overview": "Feti is a short game that doesn't have a real plot; its entire text is a conversation between two \"office ladies\" (sometimes shortened in Japanese language usage to \"OL\"), Eri and Kazumi. They chat mostly about men, clothes, and sex. The conversation develops, until the two young women begin to get intimate with each other. The game starts with both Eri and Kazumi wearing clothes, and they gradually undress as the game progresses. A special attention is paid to the variety of lingerie both women wear. The player's input is confined to decision-making; giving different answers to the girls' questions to unlock different portions of text and new pictures. There is also a cursor shaped like an eye that the player can periodically use, but it serves mostly to click on the visible body part and advance the conversation.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "March 18, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Cat's Pro", "publishers": "Cat's Pro", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/139842-feti\n"}
