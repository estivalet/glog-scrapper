{"altername_name": [], "name": "Trigger", "overview": "Trigger consists of three unrelated stories, all of which heavily focus on explicit sexual content. The first story depicts violent and monster-related sexual encounters of a young woman. In the second one, a female detective attempts to investigate the murder of her father and gets captured by the criminals. The third story deals with a raid of mechanized pirates on a spaceship controlled by two young girls. The gameplay is identical in all the three stories, consisting of visual novel-like prompts (three per scene), which do not affect the plot; the player is often required to go through the same choices several times to trigger the next scene. Most of the adult scenes are animated.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "June 17, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "ZyX", "publishers": "ZyX", "genres": "Visual Novel", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147886-trigger\n"}
