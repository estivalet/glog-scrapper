{"altername_name": [], "name": "Battletech: Ubawareta Seihai", "overview": "You are Gideon Braver Vandenburg, heir to the planet. While you were away, unknown attackers destroyed your home, killed your entire family, and stole the Chalice that you need to win the throne. When you are implicated in your own family's death, you are forced into exile. With a help of an old friend who contributed an old Jenner and some credits, you must become a mercenary. Within five years, you must travel the Inner Sphere in search of clues to who set you up, and eventually avenge your family and recover the Chalice. The player travels to planets, searching for \"fixers\" who will set up some contracts with the local authorities. The terms are a flat payment and some salvage payments. Some houses may be very stingy but provide important information. Others pay well but may not be as helpful. It is possible to buy, sell, and repair 'Mechs, hire or fire pilots, and decide which planet to move to while trying to maintain decent relationships with all five houses of the Inner Sphere and uncover clues about the next destination. Each mission in the game is randomly generated.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "March 12, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Victor Musical Industries", "publishers": "Cross Media Soft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MechWarrior_(1989_video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/132544-battletech-ubawareta-seihai\n"}
