{"altername_name": [], "name": "Kaiketsu Nikki", "overview": "Nikki, the hero of the game, is a cybernetically enhanced young man from the future. His \"home time\" is the beginning of 22th century; his home town is the international megalopolis Shinjuku City, part of the old Tokyo. Humanity prospers, living in pleasure, relying on incredible scientific achievements. One of them is the time machine. Nikki finds out than four young, attractive school girls from 1994 got involved into some sort of trouble. Using his time machine, Nikki ventures into the past, determined to save them... and expecting a lot of... err... gratitude in return! Kaiketsu Nikki is an adventure game in essence, with features somewhat unusual for a Japanese representative of the genre. As in most Japanese adventures, the interaction is done via verb commands selected from the menu. The player clicks on an object, which bring up the menu with the commands. However, while there are still no real puzzles, the challenge lies in completing certain actions in time, in order to avoid time paradoxes while staying in the past. The player must explore thoroughly the rooms of the four girls and figure out a way to conquer them.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "October 14, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Ange", "publishers": "Ange", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137382-kaiketsu-nikki\n"}
