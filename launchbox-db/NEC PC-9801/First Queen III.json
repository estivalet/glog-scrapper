{"altername_name": [], "name": "First Queen III", "overview": "Out of Chaos, Earth and Heaven were born. The spirits were the first sentient race to appear in the Heaven, and the humans were created afterwards. The two races co-existed in peace, that was only threatened by the race of demons from the Earth. In order to defeat the demons, the humans descended onto the Earth, and stayed there after their victory, building cities and forming nations. Years have passed, and the world is threatened once again, this time by the advent of the Demon King. Humans have to unite against the common enemy. But years of existence as separate nations did little to strengthen their bonds. The powerful kingdom of Ilion was the first to take action in uniting the humans. Aided by the goddess Athena, the female general Ayla and her army begin a journey to seek the help of other nations and to defeat the demons. The third entry in First Queen series retains the gameplay formula from the previous games, but emphasizes fantasy elements, anime/manga aesthetics, and more detailed characterization of the main heroes, typically for traditional Japanese RPGs. The strategic angle of commanding large armies is unchanged, as is the gocha-kyara (\"mixed-up characters\") battle system, featuring large-scale fights with dozens of friendly and enemy characters. Instead of menu-based location choice of the previous games, the main character can actually walk on a world map with icons representing locations.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Kure Software Koubou", "publishers": "Kure Software Koubou", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133342-first-queen-iii\n"}
