{"altername_name": [], "name": "Metajo: Furitsu Metatopology Daigaku Fuzoku Joshikoukou SP", "overview": "Many years ago, in imperial Japan, advances in a mysterious science called \"meta-topology\" have led to the unexpected prosperity of the Heian era. A special university was founded by the scientists, where researches in bio- and nano-technology were conducted. Since women dominated society during that time, they were the ones imbued with the powers of meta-topology. A series of conflicts between reactionary governments and the \"meta-women\", as they began calling themselves, continued thousands years into the future. Led by Mayumi Tanaka, president of the astronomy department, a group of young women tries to protect their existence using their remarkable powers. Metajo is a tactical role-playing game. The game consists of a series of large-scale battles, with cutscenes and dialogues advancing the story. The player controls a group of meta-women, navigating them over top-down battle area. The main characters are controlled by the players, while \"nameless\" units follow AI routines. Individual battles are displayed on separate screens, and are calculated according to the attributes of the participants. Leveling up occurs after having accumulated a sufficient amount of experience points.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "March 15, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "R-Force Software", "publishers": "Anjin", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137467-metajo-furitsu-metatopology-daigaku-fuzoku-joshikoukou-sp\n"}
