{"altername_name": ["M\u014dry\u014d Senki Madara: Daikong\u014d Rinhen"], "name": "Mouryou Senki Madara: Daikongou Rinhen", "overview": "The game is based on the manga series Moryou Senki Madara. The story is set in a mythological era in Japan, and focuses on twin brothers, Madara and Kage-Ou (\"Shadow King\"), sons of the evil Emperor Miroku. While Kage-Ou follows in the footsteps of his father, Madara fights against him and for the good of mankind. The game begins as Madara is gravely wounded in his fight against Miroku, but is saved by a young warrior named Seishinja, who lives together with his sister Himika. Before Madara is cured, Seishinja has to fight demons himself, with the help of the legendary sword Kusanagi. The game has traditional Japanese RPG ingredients, such as a linear story, turn-based combat, and automatic leveling. The interface, however, is different than in most RPGs, having an adventure-like menu with icon commands. The player advances in the game by traveling to different locations (still via the command menu), and battles are pre-set, dictated by the story. Beside regular attacking, many special martial moves and magic can be used.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "September 10, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kogado Studio", "publishers": "Kogado Studio", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133777-mouryou-senki-madara-daikongou-rinhen\n"}
