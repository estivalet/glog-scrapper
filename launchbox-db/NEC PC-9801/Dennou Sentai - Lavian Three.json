{"altername_name": ["Dennoo Senati Lavian"], "name": "Dennou Sentai: Lavian Three", "overview": "In 1999, a global computer network was assembled, allowing unprecedented transportation speed to different locations on the Earth through virtual reality. But it also opened virtual portals to another dimensions. The ruler of one of them, the magical empire Lemuria, concocted a plan to use the computer's energy in order to destroy the Earth. Luckily, not everyone in Lemuria shared his views, including a beautiful girl named Lares, who contacted a group of computer-loving high-school girls in Japan, and turned them into super-heroines who fight in cyberspace! The game is a turn-based strategy/RPG hybrid, a popular sub-genre among Japanese games. As in most games of this kind, extensive cut-scenes lead to long strategic battles, which take place on a top-down screen and allow turn-based navigation of the characters. The all-female player-controlled party can execute punches and kicks when enemy is in range, as well as magic spells. When certain enemy characters (also female) or player-controlled characters die, a nude picture of said character is displayed.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "July 15, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Wendy Magazine", "publishers": "Wendy Magazine", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137119-dennou-sentai-lavian-three\n"}
