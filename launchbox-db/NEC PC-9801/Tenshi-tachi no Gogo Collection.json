{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tenshi-tachi no Gogo Collection", "overview": "Tenshitachi no Gogo Collection contains three games, which are remakes of the first three entries in the Tenshitachi no Gogo series: Tenshitachi no Gogo Tenshitachi no Gogo 2: Minako Tenshitachi no Gogo 3: Ribbon The remade versions were not released separately. All the three games have updated graphics (some scenes were completely re-drawn), as well as interface changes. There is no text input and all the three remakes have a similar verb-based menu interface. The menus have been simplified, with less choices than in the original versions, removing most of the \"useless\" command combinations.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "February 22, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "JAST", "publishers": "Jast", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/149255-tenshi-tachi-no-gogo-collection\n"}
