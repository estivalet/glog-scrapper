{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sela", "overview": "The aim is to bring up the captain's only daughter as an ideal girl. Raising sim where you mostly busy with making money and then spending money on education. Side goal is to collect crown stones since perfect ending is only available with all the parameters above 150 and while having 5 crown stones. So it's more like an adult version of Princess Maker with some ADV elements incorporated since you live with the daughter at the same house.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "June 23, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Hervest", "publishers": "Hervest", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "0.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/146505-sela\n"}
