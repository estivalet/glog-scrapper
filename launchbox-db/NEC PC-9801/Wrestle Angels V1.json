{"altername_name": [], "name": "Wrestle Angels V1", "overview": "Wrestle Angels V1 is a remake of the first title in the series, taking the franchise in a new direction and greatly expanding the simulation elements. Instead of merely teaching a wrestler new moves, as was the case with previous Wrestle Angels games, the player now fully manages a team of female wrestlers, including matches, training, leisure activities, etc. The girls are recruited in the beginning of the game; afterwards, the player has to make a schedule for each girl, and also for their coach. The wrestlers' parameters may increase or decrease depending on the activities the player has chosen for them. However, most of the time, intense training (including running, weight-lifting, etc.) will raise their level greatly. The matches can be set on auto, trusting one's own training and preparation, or can be controlled manually by selecting moves from a menu. Either way, the outcome of the match is determined by the the level of the wrestlers' training much more than by the choice of moves in the match itself.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "August 25, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "KSS", "publishers": "KSS", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/131110-wrestle-angels-v1\n"}
