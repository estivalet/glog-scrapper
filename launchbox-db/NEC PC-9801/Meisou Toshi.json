Some time ago, your mother committed suicide, and you continued living with your father, the head of a large corporation that publishes video games. You are unsure about your future, but you still consider yourself a lucky person. In fact, luck seems to pursue you, like magic, especially during your encounters with women.

There are plenty of explicit sexual scenes, during which you have many detailed options to choose from.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "December 22, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tiare", "publishers": "Jast", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147770-meisou-toshi\n"}
