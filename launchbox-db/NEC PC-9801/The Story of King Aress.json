{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Story of King Aress", "overview": "The Story of King Aress is a turn-based strategy game taking place in the world of Elenes. Players take control of Aress, who, on his 16th birthday, wakes up in hopes of getting a surprise from his father Rudolph Adfral, but finds only a letter informing him that he is actually the son of a king and was taken into custody in order to protect him from harm. Having brought up and taught Aress for 16 years, his adoptive father ends the letter by telling Aress that he's free to choose his fate when he becomes the king. Aress goes out on an adventure with his two friends to claim the throne and restore his home country. The game takes place in a world map where players choose where they want to go. After making a choice, players will encounter dialogues or cutscenes which will be accompanied with a battle. Combat is turn-based with the players clicking on the characters they wish to control and moving them to an available area. When players attack the enemy or vice versa, the attacks will be shown in a different perspective. Combat is quite slow paced as both characters take turns to approach each other and land a hit with each character attacking multiple times in one turn. Characters on the battlefield may attack with different weapons, such as bows and arrows, swords, spears, clubs and other blunt weapons.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "March 18, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gust", "publishers": "Gust", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137637-the-story-of-king-aress\n"}
