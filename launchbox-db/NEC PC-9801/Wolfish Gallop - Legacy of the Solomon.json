{"altername_name": [], "name": "Wolfish Gallop: Legacy of the Solomon", "overview": "Long time ago, human beings, animals, and supernatural creatures lived together peacefully in the Garden of Eden. But a demon named Ibrus started a war against the god of time, and as a result the peaceful co-existence of different races ended. Humans were deported onto the Earth, where they formed five powerful kingdoms. The wisest of them, a king named Solomon, was known to have mysterious powers connections to the 72 most powerful demons... Years have passed, and demons attack human kingdoms. A young warrior named Shellstein is told to learn the truth about the legacy of Solomon, which is the key to defeating the demons... Wolfish Gallop: Legacy of the Solomon is a RPG with strong elements of a strategy game. The player is able to move on a linear world map, as well as visit towns and dungeon-like areas; player-controlled characters participate in turn-based combat against various enemies, in traditional Japanese RPG style. Like in strategy games, the player can control multiple parties of characters, which can form army units. Different characters take the role of main heroes during the game (Chapter One begins with the king Duran seeking help against demonic invaders), and, beside \"important\" story-related characters, simple soldiers can also be recruited and participate in battles.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "July 29, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Pandora Box", "publishers": "Pandora Box", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137699-wolfish-gallop-legacy-of-the-solomon\n"}
