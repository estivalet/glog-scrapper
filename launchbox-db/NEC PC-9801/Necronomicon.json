{"altername_name": [], "name": "Necronomicon", "overview": "Necronomicon is - as the title strongly implies - based on the writings of H.P. Lovecraft. The story is set in Lovecraft's fictional city Arkham somewhere in New England. It is said that a terrible ritual has taken place there, involving a woman giving birth to a demonic child. A journalist named Jonathan heads to Arkham to find out more about the dreadful rumors, and to explore the ruins of an ancient monastery. In the town, Jonathan meets other characters with their own agendas. Terrifying nightmares, like visions from the past, haunt Jonathan. Will he be able to preserve his sanity and solve the mystery? Necronomicon plays like a traditional Japanese-style adventure, having no puzzles at all (even though there is a rudimentary inventory in the game). However, unlike most Japanese adventures, it uses a simple point-and-click interface for interaction. Navigation is done either through a menu command, or by selecting a location on the map of Arkham. Despite the game's connection to Lovecraft stories, its graphics are distinctly Japanese, mostly following anime-manga-style aesthetics. There are disturbing scenes in the game, as well as scenes with nudity.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "FairyTale", "publishers": "FairyTale", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/134811-necronomicon\n"}
