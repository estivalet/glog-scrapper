{"altername_name": [], "name": "Marginal Storys", "overview": "Marginal Storys is composed of two short visual novels, which are accessible from the main menu and are not related to each other story-wise. The first one, entitled Forbidden Rhythm, is a bizarre horror story. The protagonist, a young man named Kyouichi, finds himself in an old mansion, which seems to contain an evil energy - dead bodies, ghosts, apparitions haunt Kyouichi, who has to recall childhood events and the incestuous feelings towards his sister. The second story is named Cosplaytor II, and is set in Tokyo, in 2019. Entertainment as we know it has disappeared off the face of the Earth, replaced by a global virtual reality game, that became the ultimate reality for many people. The player controls an agent known only by his codename (\"Z\"), who has to investigate criminal occurrences that might lead to a world-wide cyber-conspiracy. Both stories have the same kind of gameplay, which is closer to a visual novel than to \"real\" Japanese adventure. There are command menus, but they are context-related and resemble more choices of a visual novel that adventure game interaction. Some choices might lead to a Game Over.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "March 31, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Forest", "publishers": "Forest", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133377-marginal-storys\n"}
