{"altername_name": [], "name": "Marionette Mind", "overview": "Marionette Mind is a collection of three interrelated short stories depicting the adventures of an artificially created young woman. Each story is told and seen from the point of view of a different protagonist. In the first story, a young puppet-maker creates a doll of a young woman that becomes miraculously alive, and very soon discovers her sexuality. In the second story, she helps a broke performer in a puppet theater to improve his business and life. The third story is dedicated to battle puppets known as \"kugutsu\", where the artificial woman finally finds her home. The gameplay in the three stories is identical, and contains very little interaction. The player is typically presented with a number of choices on most screens, but only one of them usually leads to the continuation of the story. Despite its visual novel-like structure, there are no different outcomes to the stories available.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "August 27, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Studio Milk", "publishers": "Studio Milk", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137455-marionette-mind\n"}
