Instead of a flying man, you play as a running girl that shoots magic bolts from her staff. It has some very nice graphics for its time and boasts some very good music. It takes place in Sword World, a Tabletop Role Playing Game setting that is very popular in Japan. While most other Sword World video games are RPGs or visual novels, Alantia is very different, being an action game.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "November 21, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Victor Interactive Software", "publishers": "Cross Media Soft", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.64", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FnkQnMaDXY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/92165-alantia-legend-of-blue-star\n"}
