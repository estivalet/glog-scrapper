{"altername_name": [], "name": "M\u00f6bius Roid", "overview": "The main protagonist of M\u00f6bius Roid is a young man named Masa Taniyama, who lives alone in a mansion in a quiet district, and dedicates most of his time to one activity: sex. He also has a partner to his sexual escapades, a very \"active\" young girl named Chie. But another young girl is raped somewhere in the neighborhood, and this changes Masa's life... M\u00f6bius Roid plays like a Japanese adventure, with the largest portion of the gameplay being dedicated to menu-based moving between locations (usually parts of a high school). In some locations, a typical \"Look - Think - Talk\" menu appears. The somewhat unusual feature of this game is the fact it has two protagonists: Masa and Chie. Masa is the playable character most of the time, but the player can switch to Chie, which is sometimes dictated by the game, but sometimes is a choice that can lead to different story paths (read: sex scenes).", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "June 30, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Silky's", "publishers": "Silky's", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137474-mobius-roid\n"}
