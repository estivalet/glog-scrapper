{"altername_name": ["Schwarzschild III: Wakusei Dethperant"], "name": "Schwarzschild III: Wakusei Desperan", "overview": "Wakusei Desperan is the third entry in the Schwarzschild series and the follow-up to Teikoku no Haishin. Human civilization has expanded beyond the Milky Way, but further advancement was made difficult due to the presence of strong, consolidated alien nations beyond the borders of the galaxy. The events of the game take place in the Gardinal star system not far from the Milky Way. The player is cast into the role of Exas Graft, the human (\"Earthman\", according to the game's terminology) leader of the small Parsian Republic. Eleven nations are present in the region, and Graft must defend his new homeland through skillful diplomacy and military strategy. The game's basic gameplay rules remain similar to those of the two previous installments. Like before, the focus of the game is on grand strategy \u2014 resource management, research, diplomacy, etc., rather than on combat tactics. Like in the preceding games, combat occurs automatically and the player can only choose general commands during his turn. The interface has been revamped, with a much larger viewing area of the star system and no fixed windows for menus. Wakusei Desperan is more character-oriented than the previous entries in the series, depicting unique alien races and assigning personality traits and distinct visual appearance to each leader and general. The game's visuals also have a more pronounced anime flavor.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "February 28, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Kogado Software Products", "publishers": "Kogado Software Products", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133423-schwarzschild-iii-wakusei-desperan\n"}
