{"altername_name": [], "name": "Wakusei Omega no Q Ouji", "overview": "Space explorers from Earth discovered a strange cosmic object: a giant pumpkin nearing the planet. Upon establishing contact with the pumpkin, they discovered that this vessel belonged to Prince Q from the planet Omega. The planet's super-computer (with a powerful 4 MhZ processor) determined that the prince has to get married. In order to do that, he has to descend onto Earth and find a suitable candidate - naturally after having conducted a thorough sexual examination. Wakusei \u03a9 no Q Ouji is essentially a visual novel, though with very few plot-branching decisions. Most of the time, when the player is presented with choices, either both of them lead to the same result, or the player can select the correct one without penalty. The short romances with various characters can be completed in any order.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "September 12, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Studio Twinkle", "publishers": "Studio Twinkle", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "0.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137692-wakusei-omega-no-q-ouji\n"}
