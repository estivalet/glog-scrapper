{"altername_name": ["Koukou Kyoushi: Sei Erika Jogakuin Hen"], "name": "Koukou Kyoushi: St. Erika Jogakuin Hen", "overview": "The game has a rather simple premise: the protagonist is a young man who is looking forward to his first day on a new job, that of a teacher at the prestigious St. Erika Girls' High School. Naturally, he won't be busy with teaching alone; the goal is to get acquainted with the various female characters that populate the school, including the nurse and many of the students. Koukou Kyoushi: St. Erika Jogakuin Hen is an adventure game; though following the Japanese design philosophy by offering no puzzles and/or inventory item usage of any kind, it is nevertheless rather open-ended for a Japanese-style adventure. The player is, for the most part, free to visit various locations in the town, including many different rooms in the school, at any time. Interaction with the environment is done in a point-and-click fashion; the cursor changes to eye, face, and hand icon, depending on the object/character it hovers over. The game contains scenes with explicit nudity and sexual situations.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "January 29, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Wishbone", "publishers": "Wishbone", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147747-koukou-kyoushi-st-erika-jogakuin-hen\n"}
