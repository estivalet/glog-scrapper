{"altername_name": [], "name": "Blood Seed", "overview": "The spaceship \"Triant II\", carrying an all-female crew under the command of Rachel Hugett, was attacked by mysterious aliens. The captain ordered to fire the strongest weapons, but nothing could help: the aliens invaded the ship... ...and in a unique twist, the player has to control an alien. No information is given about this playable character, that looks like a red crab. It starts at level 1, at the point where it invaded the ship. The game plays like a first-person dungeon crawler (this time the word \"crawler\" taken quite literally!). The alien moves through the pseudo-3D corridors of the ship. Crew members, robots and machines appear randomly and try to stop it. The battles are turn-based. The alien has two primary kinds of attacks at its disposal: physical attack (with its claw), and electricity attack. Defeating enemies brings experience points, leveling up the creature.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "December 21, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Great", "publishers": "Great", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/134692-blood-seed\n"}
