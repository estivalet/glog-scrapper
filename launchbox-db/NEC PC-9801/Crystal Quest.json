{"altername_name": [], "name": "Crystal Quest", "overview": "This game (which has nothing to do either with the ZX Spectrum adventure or the Mac action game) is set in what appears to be an alternate version of the Earth. A race of demi-humans has emerged, threatening the existence of humanity. The 15th human Emperor, named Sigmatoro J. Salzstein, calls Duke Erich B. Zweiss, and explains to him the mission: recover ancient crystals from the demi-humans, which alone can save humanity. But the Duke should be careful: who knows what challenges await for him among the demi-humans, outside of the safe walls of the capital city Berlin?.. Crystal Quest is a puzzle game with adventure elements - the Duke's top-down movement and the ability to access different locations to tackle different puzzles. The locations are marked on the world map as towers and caves; in each one of them, a sexy demi-human will offer a challenge to the good Duke. The puzzles include a tile-matching memory game and a timed top-down maze sprint (find the exit before the time runs out). In each subsequent area, the difficulty of these puzzles increases, and the amount of clothes the demi-humans wear after a puzzle has been solved decreases. The music in this game includes famous classical compositions by J.S.Bach, Tchaikovsky, Satie, etc.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "July 10, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Pixy Bell", "publishers": "Pixy Bell", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/153664-crystal-quest\n"}
