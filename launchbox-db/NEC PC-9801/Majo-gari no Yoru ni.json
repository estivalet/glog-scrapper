{"altername_name": [], "name": "Majo-gari no Yoru ni", "overview": "Majo-gari means \"witch-hunt\"; indeed, that is the only thing the protagonist of the game, a young priest living in an unspecified European-like town, thinks about. According to his own words, he believes neither in God nor in the devil; his life is dedicated to one horrifying passion: torturing innocent women... Majo-gari no Yoru ni is a Japanese-style adventure with very simple gameplay. The player selects locations from a menu; visiting them in specific order usually triggers scenes and advances the story. \"Look\", \"Talk\" and similar commands must be sometimes used to lead to the next event. Some of the events will be triggered only if specific conditions are met. The game is heavy on explicit sexual content, and contains scenes with graphical depictions of rape, torture, and sexual violence. Most of these actions are obligatory and are perpetrated by the player-controlled character.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "October 13, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "AIL", "publishers": "AIL", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/139326-majo-gari-no-yoru-ni\n"}
