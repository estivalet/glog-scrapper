His boss, a mysterious high-ranked agent named Cropp, tells him about a strictly classified project under the codename IBIS, which was intended as a counter-terror measure. Four young women have been apprehended under suspicious circumstances (amnesia following an accident, proximity to weapon research facility, etc.). Pat's task is to interrogate those women and to find out the truth about their activities. In the beginning of the game the protagonist is shown all the four dossiers, and the player can choose to play the four interrogations in any order. The game has a typical Japanese-adventure interface with verb commands (\"Look\", \"Talk\", \"Think\") and some specific commands during particular situations. The game advances through continuous usage of these commands. The game has scenes with explicit sexual content.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "November 30, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "May-Be Soft", "publishers": "May-Be Soft", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147635-file-kokubousoushou-jouhoubu-jouhourouei-taisakubu-josei-jinmonin\n"}
