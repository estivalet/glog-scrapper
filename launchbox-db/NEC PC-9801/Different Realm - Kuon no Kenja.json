{"altername_name": [], "name": "Different Realm: Kuon no Kenja", "overview": "The Millennium Science Laboratory is proud to present its most recent and daring discovery: the Energy Shell. A machine that occupies one room can produce an amount of energy that is strong enough even to disrupt time. During the presentation, unforeseen circumstances cause the machine to initiate a time shift, during which the head scientist Stockman and one of his subordinates are teleported to a fantastic world where psyonic powers take the place of technology, and where four different species have co-existed peacefully until the accident. The Dragon Tusk tribe gives shelter to Stockman, but he must undo the time shift, prevent further disasters, and find a way to return to his world... Different Realm plays like a traditional Japanese turn-based RPG, with party management, world map exploration, top-down view, and automatic leveling up. It also utilizes Glodia's patented combat system, which they also used in their other RPGs, such as Emerald Dragon and Vain Dream: characters are able to move on the battlefield, and the speed of attack depends on the distance between the controlled character and the enemy. The player has to assign initial parameters to the protagonist (Stockman) before the game begins.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "September 24, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Glodia", "publishers": "Glodia", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/qc0GCkmnrV8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/135104-different-realm-kuon-no-kenja\n"}
