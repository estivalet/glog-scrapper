{"altername_name": ["Hyooryuu"], "name": "Hyouryuu", "overview": "It's the end of 21st century. Five high-school youngsters are out camping near Tokyo. Suddenly, they are transported into a different place. It looks like a jungle. It's very hot. And it's certainly not Japan. As the heroes investigate the surroundings, they realize that they were taken to Lagoon Republic, a mysterious independent country on a tropical island that has been the home of a bizarre incident over seventy years ago. Now the young people have to find the truth behind their presence in Lagoon, and to solve the mystery of the island, while avoiding the dangers that await them. Hy\u014dry\u016b is a Japanese-style adventure game. Like most games of this genre, it is composed of still screens with super-imposed text boxes. There is no physical movement in the game. The interaction is minimal and mostly involves making decisions through command menu (such as \"go forward\" or \"go left\"). Depending on the player's decisions, he can reach the true ending or one of the numerous \"dead ends\". The game contains nudity and sexual situations, although they are not as numerous as one would normally expect from an Illusion game. There is also no sexual interactivity in the game.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "September 13, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Illusion", "publishers": "Illusion", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.07", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137311-hyouryuu\n"}
