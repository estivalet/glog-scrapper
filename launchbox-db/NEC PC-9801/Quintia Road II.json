{"altername_name": [], "name": "Quintia Road II", "overview": "News Chrome is a young FBI agent who was pursuing an evasive target on a mission. Suddenly, the suspect disappeared into a portal. Following him, News found himself in a desert. Before long he meets a princess named Sarah who asks him to aid the inhabitants of the magical world Quintia against a mysterious sorcerer. The sequel to Quintia Road has a similar Japanese-style menu-based verb interface, this time also allowing some basic combinations with objects from a list. Game progression is for the most part strictly linear, with only a few instances allowing the player to choose the next destination. Like in the previous game, there are sporadic scripted turn-based battles. The sequel features a more developed RPG-like system that allows the player to distribute experience points gained after battle to raise the combatants' attributes. However, as there is no possibility to freely engage in combat, this feature has little impact on the advancement of the game. Like the predecessor, the game contains scenes with nudity and explicit sexual situations.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "April 15, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Communication Group Plum", "publishers": "Great Co., Ltd.", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137542-quintia-road-ii\n"}
