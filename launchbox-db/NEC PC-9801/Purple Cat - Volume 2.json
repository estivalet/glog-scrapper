One of the stories, Bizarre Princess Part 2, is an episode in a series started in the previous installment. The gameplay is nearly non-existent for the most part. However, a few stories offer \"decision points\" that would slightly influence subsequent events.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "May 21, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Palm Tree Soft", "publishers": "Palm Tree Soft", "genres": "Visual Novel", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147815-purple-cat-volume-2\n"}
