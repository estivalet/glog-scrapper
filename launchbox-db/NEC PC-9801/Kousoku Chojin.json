{"altername_name": [], "name": "Kousoku Chojin", "overview": "Haruki is a student at the prestigious private Morino High School, which he attends together with his beautiful sister, and where he leads the drama class. One day, Haruki discovers a strange toupee that transforms his body. Unbeknownst to him, he has gained special powers and comes into contact with a strange violent world that is hidden inside the school. Now he must understand what's truly going on there, at the same time trying to \"score\" with every girl he meets - be it student or teacher... Kousoku Chojin plays like a cross between a \"normal\" Japanese-style adventure and a visual novel. The player has some freedom in choosing the locations he wants Haruki to visit, which triggers specific conversations and scenes. However, there is no other interaction with the game world beside this menu-based navigation - no possibility to actively examine objects, talk to people, etc.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "April 26, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Foster", "publishers": "Foster", "genres": "Visual Novel", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/142078-kousoku-chojin\n"}
