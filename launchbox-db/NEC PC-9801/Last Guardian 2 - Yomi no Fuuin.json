{"altername_name": [], "name": "Last Guardian 2: Yomi no Fuuin", "overview": "Last Guardian 2: Yomi no F\u016bin is a direct sequel to the first game in the Last Guardian series. It continues the unfinished story of the first game - the adventures of a group of heroes from the Beast nation. The sequel focuses on two of the previous game's main characters, Badio and his sweetheart Miriana. Traveling by ship, the couple arrives in a small city in the Eastern continent, where they meet a dying warrior from the Dragon tribe, who is holding a child in his arms, begging the heroes to bring him safely to his people. But Badio and his friends know it won't be easy, when they are attacked by a group of Beast Hunters, and when the powerful enemies continue plotting their schemes against the heroes... The gameplay is very similar to that of the first game, with a few minor changes. As before, there is no exploration or movement outside the battles; the entire game consists of long strategic fights and cut scenes. Once again, the player has access to beast transformation for the characters in the party. The player-controlled characters level up automatically, but this time can level up in the middle of the battle. The \"Defend\" command is now available, requiring 1 action point. Some changes were made to the interface (different icons, design of the menus, etc.), but otherwise, nothing essential has been changed compared to the previous game.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "July 12, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Studio Inferno", "publishers": "Anjin", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/136479-last-guardian-2-yomi-no-fuuin\n"}
