Rounds won by the player lead to undressing animations; however, while the computer version has explicit nudity, console versions are censored. All the versions have the same opponents, cutscenes, and gameplay rules. The computer version adds a versus mode in which girls can compete against each other, while the Super Famicom (SNES) version has a so-called \"puzzle mode\", which reveals parts of a puzzle as the player wins mahjong rounds.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "February 16, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "SETA", "publishers": "Ving", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137642-super-real-mahjong-piv-final\n"}
