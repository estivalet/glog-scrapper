{"altername_name": [], "name": "S-Express", "overview": "The protagonist of the game is a young Japanese man who is lucky enough to win a ride on the S-Express, a miraculous train connecting Australia with Canada and going through almost the entire world with stops in Singapore, Japan, China, India, Israel, Russia, France, Ivory Coast, Brazil, Panama, and USA. Nearly the whole game is set on the train itself, with only a few locations accessible within. S-Express is built like a visual novel, with the player's input entirely confined to selecting locations on the train, triggering scenes. Each such scene advances the time needed for the train to reach the next stop. The goal is to develop relationships with the several female characters onboard the train, and unlock as many sex scenes as possible with them. New girls board the train continuously as the journey advances. Failure to trigger a sufficient amount of scenes will end the trip (and the journey) prematurely before the final destination (Quebec) is reached.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "May 12, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Ange", "publishers": "Ange", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137604-s-express\n"}
