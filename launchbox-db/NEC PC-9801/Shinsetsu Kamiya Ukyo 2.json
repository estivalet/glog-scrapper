{"altername_name": [], "name": "Shinsetsu Kamiya Ukyo 2", "overview": "This game probably has one of the most disturing game intros I've seen on the PC-98, and the rest of the game follows the intro rather well. It's an adventure game that really is almost a visual novel, with only a couple of binary choices for you to make. You date on of two girls, and frequently, get horrifically killed by some knife wielding nut in the endings.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Altacia", "publishers": "Altacia", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/139422-shinsetsu-kamiya-ukyo-2\n"}
