{"altername_name": ["Jonason: Cugutu no Mai"], "name": "Jonason: Kugutsu no Mai", "overview": "Kamome and Arisa are two freelance detectives, and their current assignment is to protect Kimiko Ichijou, the daughter of a wealthy oligarch. Three days before her birthday, someone tipped the detective off about a possible assassination attempt. Kimiko has been recently transferred to the prestigious Seika Girls High School. Kamome decides to infiltrate the school, working undercover under the disguise of a janitor. Soon he realizes that powerful figures from a corporation that Kimiko's family is part of are not about to give up, and his life is in danger as well... Jonason is a Japanese-style adventure, without puzzles and with menu-based interaction. The interface is point-and-click, meaning that instead of the more typical omnipresent fixed menu commands the player first clicks on an object and then chooses one of the possible actions. There are a few timed sequences, which require the player to perform the necessary actions before the time runs out and the game is lost. The game contains scenes with nudity and sexual situations.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "April 21, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "XYZ", "publishers": "Xyz", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147736-jonason-kugutsu-no-mai\n"}
