{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mujintou Monogatari", "overview": "Mujint\u014d Monogatari is a self-described \"survival life simulation\". A plane crashes into the sea, but the protagonist survives and reaches a seemingly deserted island. The protagonist finds a cabin with a few basic supplies. From that point on, the player has to manage the hero's activities. Water, food and light sources have to be provided. The protagonist can team up with other survivors and explore the island, gradually revealing new locations; this can be done in co-operative mode. Expeditions to other places take place automatically, and must be planned in advance by the player. The protagonist's statistics (stamina, speed, etc.) will change depending on the activities chosen by the player.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "August 5, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Mediamuse", "publishers": "KSS", "genres": "Life Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137482-mujintou-monogatari\n"}
