{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cest La Vie", "overview": "The game puts the player in a role of an aspiring young painter, who is more interested in pretty, young, naked models than in the art itself. It starts slowly, but soon the hero finds himself sexually involved with different young women, and the net of relationships grows more and more complex... Cest La Vie is a Japanese adventure with the omnipresent \"Look\" and \"Talk\" commands. As in many other games of this genre, most of the game is text super-imposed on still graphics, and the player has to go through the same commands over and over again in order to trigger the next scene.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "February 28, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "May-Be Soft", "publishers": "May-Be Soft", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137092-cest-la-vie\n"}
