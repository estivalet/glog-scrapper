{"altername_name": ["Mary\u016b Gakuen: Kegasareta Nikutai", "Maryu Gakuen: Yogosareta Nikutai"], "name": "Maryuu Gakuen: Kegasareta Nikutai", "overview": "This game can be considered a sequel to Nerawareta Shitai, since they both share the same story arc and many gameplay elements. However, Kegasareta Nikutai follows the adventures of another hero, also a high-school student, named Takuya. Lately he has been having strange dreams, seeing a glowing face surrounded by warriors. One day, the strange face contacts him, saying that the spirit of an ancient dragon in another world needs Takuya's help, since he is the only one who can find the girl with the powers to save that other dimension. Takuya is then taken to the parallel world, where the civilization is still in the medieval stage, and is aided by two local warriors when he starts his journey. The gameplay is similar to that of Nerawareta Shitai: most of the game is spent exploring pseudo-3D maze-like dungeons, fighting random enemies in turn-based combat viewed from a side perspective. However, Kegasareta Nikutai adds more \"mainstream\" RPG elements, such as a party of three right from the beginning, a town where the heroes can buy supplies, and the possibility to equip weapons and armor.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "December 16, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Peach Soft", "publishers": "Peach Soft", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133382-maryuu-gakuen-kegasareta-nikutai\n"}
