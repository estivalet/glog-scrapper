{"altername_name": [], "name": "Viper CTR: Asuka", "overview": "Viper CTR: Asuka is a direct sequel to one of the three short stories included in Viper V-10, Northern Lights. The protagonist of the game is a captain of a kendo team. Recently he has been having a romantic affair with Asuka, one of the strongest fighters on the team. But everything falls apart when the hero's cousin, a sexy girl named Miki, moves with him. The hero has to choose with whom to be together - or he can lose them both... Like other Viper games, the player input in \"Viper CTR\" is minimal: most of the player's time is spent reading text and watching the animated sex sequences. The interaction appears in the form of decision-making (selecting a text option). Some decisions lead to a premature end of the game, while the correct ones advance the story.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "January 24, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Sogna", "publishers": "Sogna", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.12", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133085-viper-ctr-asuka\n"}
