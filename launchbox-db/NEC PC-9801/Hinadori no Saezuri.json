The game is set in a pseudo-historical scenery that resembles the Victorian era in Europe. The player is cast into the role of Foster, a manager of a large mansion. The owner is a young lady named Carol, daughter of the late baron who was successfully running a brothel in it, until it was burnt down. Now the house is rebuilt, and the business can start again. Carol entrusts Foster with teaching and managing the work of the maids, who double as hostesses and prostitutes. What is meant by \"teaching\" is actually training in all things related to sex.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "March 28, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Studio B-Room", "publishers": "Studio B-Room", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147727-hinadori-no-saezuri\n"}
