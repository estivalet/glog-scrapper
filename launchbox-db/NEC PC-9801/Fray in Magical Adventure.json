{"altername_name": [], "name": "Fray in Magical Adventure", "overview": "Fray In Magical Adventure is a side-story in the Xak series. The events of the game are parallel to those described in the second Xak games. The player controls Fray, a young girl whom Latok, the protagonist of Xak series, has saved during the events of the first game. Fray falls in love with Latok and decides to prove him that she can be more than just a damsel in distress. She studies magic in a university for three years and afterwards begins a long journey to find Latok and to help him in his battle against evil. This is a top-down action game, which can be called a shooter of the run and gun variety, even though it is set in a medieval world. Fray can only use her staff, which works as a ranged weapon, casting projectiles. By pressing down the action button, it is possible to increase the size and the power of the projected missile. With the exception of towns, the screen scrolls vertically when Fray moves forward. Like in most shooters of this type, Fray receives damage when she touches an enemy or hit by its projectile attack. Fray visits towns on the way, where she can buy weapons, armor, potions, and magical spells.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Micro Cabin", "publishers": "Micro Cabin", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fray_in_Magical_Adventure", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/XpNtHYBa5wY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137200-fray-in-magical-adventure\n"}
