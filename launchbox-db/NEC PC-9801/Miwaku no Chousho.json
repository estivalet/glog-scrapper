The protagonist, a young man named Shinnosuke, discovers a beautiful mansion, in which apparently a large-scale party is taking place. Determined to meet and enchant some beautiful women, he ventures into the mansion. The rest of the story develops according to the decisions made by the player, which are restricted to choosing one of the several available locations within the mansion, and dialogue prompts during conversations with young women. Depending on these choices, the player will have the opportunity to uncover various scenes involving these women, which eventually lead to sexual intercourse between them and the protagonist. Subsequent plot events and the ending depend on the exact way the player has pursued these relationships.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "December 8, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Black Package", "publishers": "Black Package", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/139767-miwaku-no-chousho\n"}
