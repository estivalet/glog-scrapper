{"altername_name": [], "name": "Otome Senki", "overview": "Otome Senki is set in 16th century, during the Sengoku (\"Warring States\") period of Japanese history. The plot of the game is rather simple: an unnamed princess is kidnapped by demons, and the warlord Oda Nobunaga calls the bravest warriors to rescue her. However, all the men are either gravely wounded or unwilling to fight. Nine young maidens join forces and venture into a monster-infested dungeon to rescue the princess. The game is a pseudo-3D dungeon crawler. Most of the game is spent exploring the maze-like dungeon (no auto-map feature), solving the simple puzzles (such as pulling switches) and finding the correct way. Enemies appear randomly and are engaged in turn-based combat. Each one of the nine heroines has different combat statistics and abilities: some are oriented towards sword techniques, others focus on support, etc. The player can build a party of four maidens out of the available nine. If the entire party is defeated in the dungeon, the player can assemble a second party and continue the game. Otome Senki contains scenes with nudity. Some of the enemies in the game are half- or completely naked young women.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Alice Soft", "publishers": "Alice Soft", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/139398-otome-senki\n"}
