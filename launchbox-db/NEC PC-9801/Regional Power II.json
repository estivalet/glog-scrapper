{"altername_name": [], "name": "Regional Power II", "overview": "Regional Power II is set entirely in space. However, it is not a space combat or trading simulation; rather, it has similarities with grand strategy games such as Koei's historical simulation series, though with a much heavier emphasis on construction and research. The player can choose to go through a campaign, choose any of the five available scenarios in it right in the beginning, or create an own scenario in a randomly generated space map. The background for the available scenarios is fairly abstract, with the player always taking control of a nameless high commander with a few generic politicians and admirals to manage. Each planet in the player-controlled space can be used for colonizations. Space stations can be built in the orbit, and cities, factories, and other facilities constructed on the surface. All these activities are automatized and not displayed visually. The player can also build combat spaceships and outfit them with various bodies, engines, and weapons such as lasers, missiles, etc. New types of craft and accessories can be researched and eventually produced. Diplomacy and spying can be used for contact with other nations; however, the emphasis is on internal development of the fleet and fortification of the player-controlled planets.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "March 20, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Cosmos Computer", "publishers": "Cosmos Computer", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/136573-regional-power-ii\n"}
