{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dungeon Hack", "overview": "Combine the gameplay ideas of Hack/NetHack with the Eye of the Beholder III game engine and you get a graphical version of Hack: Dungeon Hack. Largely based on a construction set, the player can create their own dungeons and then crawl through them. This is the ultimate dungeon crawl with over 4 billion possible dungeon configurations thanks to the random level generator. The generator has the ability to regenerate the entire dungeon structure, or just the items, the style, monster frequency, trap frequency... or any combination thereof. Also includes a permadeath option that, when a character dies, completely deletes the character and saved games.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "March 31, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "DreamForge Intertainment", "publishers": "Right Stuff", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_Hack", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/135097-dungeon-hack\n"}
