{"altername_name": [], "name": "X-Girl", "overview": "In the near future, Japan became involved in a war against the most powerful states of the world. As a result, it was nearly devastated. 30% of its population became immigrants. Tokyo became center of military organizations at war with each other. In such a world lives a highly trained Japanese female soldier named Kiyomi. But everything changes when the military brings Kiyomi to a mysterious woman, who requires a trained agent like her to capture four female prisoners who had just escaped... X-Girl is a point-and-click adventure game. The interaction is performed by clicking on objects or people with the left mouse button; the cursor remains the same for all the actions, and the player is unable to choose a specific one. There are also a few timed battle sequences in the game, during which the player has to guess the enemy's weak points and to quickly click on them with the mouse before the time runs out. When Kiyomi captures the prisoners, she interrogates and tortures them. The interaction switches to icon-based one, with various torture instruments (whip, etc.) displayed as selectable icons. The player should then use these instruments on the captured girl in various ways, until the interrogation is complete. The game contains explicit scenes with sadism and sexual torture, which are performed by the playable character and controlled by the player.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "April 19, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Red-Zone", "publishers": "FairyTale", "genres": "Visual Novel", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "0.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/141573-x-girl\n"}
