{"altername_name": [], "name": "Yuugiri Ningyoushi no Isan", "overview": "Kyohei is a college student. During summer vacation he visits his hometown. At the train station he's stuck in the fierce rain and invited by a beautiful woman to take shelter in her house. There is a locked door in the house that emits blue light and has the note on it saying \"Beware of the bell\". A horror game in traditional rural atmosphere. The first game to have autoplay function! Never thought any PC-98 game had that! There are multiple branches determined by 29 choices. Only two good endings are prepared altogether with much more bad endings. There is no real story, just exploring the house. Horror effects are done well for a pc-98 game.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "August 23, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Desire", "publishers": "Desire", "genres": "Visual Novel", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/140783-yuugiri-ningyoushi-no-isan\n"}
