{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dalk", "overview": "A young man gets involved in a struggle between the gods Martis and Mira. Serving Martis, he believes that in order to restore the balance he has to unseal this deity, the protector of all women. Fourteen chosen girls must fight alongside the hero, venturing into the depth of a sacred mountain and helping him to defeat countless monsters who live there. Made by the creators of Rance series, Dalk is an erotic RPG. However, it is more heavy on strategy element than Rance games. Town navigation is done from first-person view. You choose your party members among the 14 available girls, and take them to fight in the mountain. Once you enter the dungeon, the game switches to top-down view, and you advance in turn-based mode, assigning commands to your party and waiting for the enemy party to move. You can attack when an enemy is in range, or cast spells with your magic users.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "December 15, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Alice Soft", "publishers": "Alice Soft", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133285-dalk\n"}
