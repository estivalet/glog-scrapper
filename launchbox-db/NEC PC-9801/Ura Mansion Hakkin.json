{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ura Mansion Hakkin", "overview": "The protagonist of the game is an ordinary Japanese man who lives together with his pretty wife Harunako. Two years after their marriage, they decided to move into a mansion in the suburbs. Everything seems normal when the couple arrives. But very quickly they both become involved in sexual intrigues, and witness strange events - mostly of sexual nature - that occur in the presence of their neighbors. Looks like the quiet family life they were hoping for will never become reality... Ura Mansion Hakkin is an adventure game with very limited interaction, which mostly plays like \"choose-your-adventure\" book. The protagonist is automatically taken to different locations and through the story; however, many scenes offer the possibility to make a choice, selecting a corresponding command from the menu. Some of these choices just involve choosing different ways of sexual intercourse, while others propel the story into a different direction. The game is very heavy on explicit sexual content, the majority of its scenes being depictions of sexual encounters the hero witnesses or participates in.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "May 24, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Illusion", "publishers": "Illusion", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147891-ura-mansion-hakkin\n"}
