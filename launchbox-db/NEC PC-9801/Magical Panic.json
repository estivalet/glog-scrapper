{"altername_name": [], "name": "Magical Panic", "overview": "A powerful, wealthy and mysterious man named Alex orders his servant to gather sorcerers and cast a spell that would transport him to a quiet town in Japan and make him look like an ordinary teenager. After the transformation, Alex heads to the Fujiwara High School and says he is the new transfer student. The reasons for his actions and the secret of his true identity are gradually revealed as the school is being threatened by evil beings, and heroines with supernatural powers defend it. But in the meantime, the new student must invoke the sexual desires of the town's female inhabitants... Magical Panic is a Japanese-style adventure with erotic elements. Interaction with the environment is performed by selecting verbs from a menu (such as \"Look\", \"Listen\", \"Move\", etc.), sometimes combining them with objects appearing in a sub-menu. There are no puzzles and no inventory management in the game.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "July 12, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Pearl Soft", "publishers": "Pearl Soft", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137436-magical-panic\n"}
