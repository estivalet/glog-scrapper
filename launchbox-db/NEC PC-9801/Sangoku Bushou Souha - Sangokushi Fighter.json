This created a convenient atmosphere for bandits, and the land was in turmoil. Then the Emperor ordered the ten dukes to take it on themselves to restore peace in the land, but the dukes instead fought amongst themselves. Finally, the duke Cao Cao took the Emperor captive and he now controls the realm. The player, however, must use five fighters to take on Cao Cao's forces and restore equilibrium to the land.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "September 15, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Panda Entertainment Technology", "publishers": "Imagineer", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.25", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sango_Fighter", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106074-sangoku-bushou-souha-sangokushi-fighter\n"}
