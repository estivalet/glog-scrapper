{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dragon Pink: The Zero Castle", "overview": "The game is based on the unfinished manga Dragon Pink by ITOYOKO, which is an erotic parody on cliche fantasy computer RPG stories. It describes the adventures of a young man named Santa, his cute cat-girl slave Pink and their companions: the slow-witted, but powerful Bobo, and he enigmatic female elf Pierce. The story of the game doesn't follow the exact plot of the manga, but rather depicts some of their typical adventures: monsters roam the wilderness, robbers attack unsuspecting travelers, so the heroes decide to venture to the capital city and offer their services to the rulers. Somewhat ironically (since the original manga was created to make fun of computer RPGs), the game is a very traditional Japanese-style RPG with a basic system: the party of four heroes roaming the top-down world map, visiting towns and dungeons, buying equipment, and fighting randomly appearing enemies in first-person-perspective turn-based combat.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "July 24, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Striker", "publishers": "Striker", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133169-dragon-pink-the-zero-castle\n"}
