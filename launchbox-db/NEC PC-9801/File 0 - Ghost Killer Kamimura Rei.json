{"altername_name": [], "name": "File 0: Ghost Killer Kamimura Rei", "overview": "Kamimura Rei is a ghost killer. She is assisted by shrine maiden Shirui Mika who can listen to the spirits of the deceased. Together they solve thee spirit-related cases. The three cases are straightforward and rather short. There is enough yuri element in the game. It's nice to see that Miki hobby is BL manga and she can be considered the first visual novel fujoshi. Game starts strong with detailed main heroines profiles and interaction between the heroines is fun, but game ends right after the three short cases and there's no feeling of complete work.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "May 24, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Colossus", "publishers": "Colossus", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/139965-file-0-ghost-killer-kamimura-rei\n"}
