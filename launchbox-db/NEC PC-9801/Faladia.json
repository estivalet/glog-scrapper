{"altername_name": [], "name": "Faladia", "overview": "Faladia is the last in the row of Kinpukurin's experimental RPGs. As in their other games, the story is very sparse: a certain kingdom has enjoyed an age of peace and prosperity, but when the gods turned away from the people, it was invaded by enemies. A group of survivors has escaped into a cave, and it is from there that the nameless hero of the game begins his adventure. Similarly to Kinpukurin's earlier RPG Free Will, Faladia combines elements of Japanese RPG (top-down navigation, random turn-based battles with simple mechanics, etc.) with a more \"Western\" approach to RPG design. The gameplay is focused on exploration rather than on linear advancement with scripted story events. Instead of the usual Japanese practice of assigning a few story-related party members, Faladia allows to recruit most of the NPCs the player encounters in towns (up to 9 active characters). The player can also choose one of the four ways of interaction with every NPC: neutral, \"loving\", haggling, and aggressive. Aggressive behavior invariably leads to fight; it is therefore possible to attack every NPC in the game (though in most cases it results in the death of the underpowered hero).", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "April 28, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Kinpukurin", "publishers": "Kinpukurin", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137172-faladia\n"}
