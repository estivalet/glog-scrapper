Following the death of his father, he stays in the house of one of his female cousins, with other members of the family also being there. That night, Koichi sees a particularly violent dream, in which he succumbs to his inexplicable beastly instincts and brutally murders a young girl. But the next day her finds out that a girl has really been murdered at exactly the same spot he saw in his nightmare... Kizuato is an adult, predominantly horror-themed visual novel. Most of the game consists of textual descriptions and conversations superimposed on background graphics and still portraits. The gameplay is limited to occasional choices, which might trigger different scenes. The game uses standard anime-style graphics for the characters, but the backgrounds have a more photorealistic look, mostly in black-white or sepia tones.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "July 26, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Leaf", "publishers": "Leaf", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137392-kizuato\n"}
