{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hop Step Jump", "overview": "Hot Step Jump is a strip mahjong game with a background story. The hero, a young man named Byakko, is back to his home town. Several years ago, when he was too young and not considerate enough, he convinced a girl named Reiko to play strip mahjong with him. Later the hero understood that what he did was wrong; Reiko was just a child back then. His atonement was perhaps a bit strange; he traveled to China, and studied there the game of mahjong. So now he is back, and he is determined to invite the now fully-grown Reiko (and other pretty girls in the town) to... more strip mahjong games! The game unfolds pretty much the way you'd expect from a strip mahjong game: the player must beat the girls in mahjong, one by one. Each time a girl loses, she removes an article of her clothes. Once she is completely defeated/naked, the hero automatically moves on to the next match.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "December 18, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Forest", "publishers": "Forest", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/142062-hop-step-jump\n"}
