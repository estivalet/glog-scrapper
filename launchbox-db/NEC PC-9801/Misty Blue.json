{"altername_name": [], "name": "Misty Blue", "overview": "Kazuya Mizukami is a young musician who returns to Japan after having spent four years studying abroad. However, things don't go very smoothly, and Kazuya even quarrels with a music producer who doesn't appreciate his talent. Everything becomes much worse when the producer is found dead shortly after their quarrel, and Kazuya becomes a murder suspect. He must clear his name, but for that he will need the help of his friends. Misty Blue is a mystery-themed adventure game. There are no real puzzles in the game; however, the gameplay differs somewhat from most traditional Japanese adventures. The standard verb command menu is present only in a few locations. Most of the game is dedicated to conversations, during which the player must choose dialogue options. Characters Kazuya talks to have special meters that show how well they react to the player's choices. In addition, certain locations require the player to conduct some investigation, examining items and making conclusions.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "July 28, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Enix Corporation", "publishers": "Enix Corporation", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137472-misty-blue\n"}
