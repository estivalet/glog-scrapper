{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dragon Master Silk II", "overview": "In this sequel to Dragon Master Silk: Ryuu Shoukan Musume, the young Silk and her minions, the three cute, sexy elemental dragon girls Ao, Aka, and Ki are joined by a new dragon girl - Ruli, the purple-haired Dragon of Wisdom. The team shows the new recruit the cave with the sealed evil dragon - but an unfortunate accident breaks the seal, monsters invade the land, and our heroines have to save it once again, venturing into deep and dangerous dungeons... Dragon Master Silk II plays very similarly to the previous game, one notable exception being the extra party member (Ruli). Most of the game takes place in first-person maze-like dungeons. Enemies appear randomly. It is possible to set the party on auto, assign general strategies (\"don't use magic\", etc.), or control every party member individually. The party can visit the town to buy items and rest. Typically for the series, Dragon Master Silk II features \"super-deformed\" graphics, humorous dialogues and situations. There are plenty of scantily dressed young girls and sexual innuendo in the game, but no explicit nudity or sex scenes.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "August 4, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Gimmick House", "publishers": "Gimmick House", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133167-dragon-master-silk-ii\n"}
