{"altername_name": [], "name": "Angel Army", "overview": "The first creation of Illusion, a company famous for its adult games, was a turn-based war game - with the only factor hinting at its creator's libido-flattering future being the generals of the game - all pretty girls, all from different countries. There are three modes in the game: player vs. computer, in which the player selects any general of any country; campaign mode, in which the player progresses stage-by-stage, beginning with Japan; and two-player mode, in which the players can choose any stage from the beginning. The gameplay itself is rather complex; as the general, the player has to protect his cities and at the same time send his army to combat the invading opponent. There is a wide variety of different units, including jets, helicopters, tanks, etc. Whenever a unit approaches an enemy unit, it can perform an attack, assuming that its weapons remain in range. Attacks are displayed as separate screens, graphically displaying the results. The player can choose to give up when it is clear that there are no chances for victory. Either way, a successful invasion of the opponent results in Game Over.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "April 1, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Illusion", "publishers": "Illusion", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.58", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/131107-angel-army\n"}
