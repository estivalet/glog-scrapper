{"altername_name": [], "name": "Custom Mate 2", "overview": "The second game in the Custom Mate series once again allows the hero to create the girl of his dreams; this time not magically, but by engaging the services of Custom Corporation, whose operator is nevertheless still the same cute elf who created the girls in the previous game. The \"girl creation\" part offers more possibilities than before, such as exact bra size or the clothes the girl will wear (school girl, nurse, etc.). This allows more combinations and therefore more different girls. The \"seduction simulator\" part is simplified compared to the first game. Instead of menu-based interface, initiating conversations, and physical interaction, the entire seduction part is composed of a conversation between the protagonist and the girl. The dialogue/action choices, however, are numerous and varied. The difficulty level varies greatly depending on the girl's personality, age, profession, etc.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "October 21, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Cocktail Soft", "publishers": "Cocktail Soft", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133284-custom-mate-2\n"}
