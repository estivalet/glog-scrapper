{"altername_name": ["Mary\u016b Gakuen: Nerawareta Shitai"], "name": "Maryuu Gakuen: Nerawareta Shitai", "overview": "Long time ago, there were two dragons in the world: the Blue Dragon, also called Dragon of Creation, and the Red Dragon - the Dragon of Destruction. They fought each other, and the Blue Dragon was victories, sealing Red Dragon's spirit. But his injuries were too grave, and he disappeared from our world, entrusting his spirit to a few select humans. Many years later, a high-school student named Kamiya Tenma discovers, to his amazement, that his school has been overrun by monsters. The spirit of the Blue Dragon contacts him, telling him that his lady friend Miku holds the key to victory over those who want to resurrect the Red Dragon. Armed with the magic spells given to him by the Blue Dragon, the young man begins to explore the infested school... Maryuu Gakuen: Nerawareta Shitai is a first-person dungeon crawler. The player navigates Tenma through the maze-like pseudo-3D environments (with auto-map), fighting random enemies in turn-based combat. The battles are viewed from a side perspective. Most of the gameplay is dedicated to exploring every corner of the dungeon, finding the items necessary to advance to the next area. The RPG system is very basic, with MP used for various spells (including supporting defensive magic), automatic leveling up, and no equipment. The game contains scenes with nudity and sexual situations.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "July 16, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Peach Soft", "publishers": "Peach Soft", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133383-maryuu-gakuen-nerawareta-shitai\n"}
