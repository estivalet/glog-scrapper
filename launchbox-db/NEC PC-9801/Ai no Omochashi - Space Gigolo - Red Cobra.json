{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ai no Omochashi: Space Gigolo: Red Cobra", "overview": "Mr. M (whom true fans of Illusion games will certainly recognize as the one and the only Mokkoriman) is an alien who looks like a human being. Since he is a super-hero, his main concern is to save people - most importantly, women. For Mr. M, \"saving\" is synonymous with \"sexually satisfying\". There are beautiful women on remote planets that have not experienced the joy of true sexual satisfaction. Only one man can save them - Mr. M's friend, the famous Space Gigolo, Red Cobra, the one who \"lives and dies for love and justice\"! And he has just the right tool - an intelligent sex toy named Pakki! But alas, not all is simple: the sexy, but deadly intergalactic warrior Mangoose and her minions will do everything possible to stop Red Cobra! Be vigilant, hero! Usually just called Red Cobra, this game is yet another Illusion-made genre experiment. This time, we are talking about space shooter with sex. The player controls Red Cobra's spaceship in a pseudo-3D scrolling environment. The gameplay is what one would expect from a space shooter: shoot everything, avoid enemy blows, grab the power-ups, beat a boss, finish the stage. Everything is controlled with the mouse: moving it moves the ship on screen, holding the left button fires at enemies. There are three selectable difficulty levels. The game also has extensive, story-heavy cut-scenes between the shooting levels, with plenty of dialogue and - naturally - sex scenes. The sex scenes in this game are quite mild (especially for Illusion) and mostly involve women \"rescued\" by Red Cobra using the sex toy Pakki for... well, what sex toys are usually used for. Some of these scenes are animated.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "March 10, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Illusion", "publishers": "Illusion", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.58", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137677-ai-no-omochashi-space-gigolo-red-cobra\n"}
