{"altername_name": [], "name": "Animahjong X Perfect", "overview": "There is no real story in this game: the nameless protagonist is a young man who roams the city in his car with just one goal in mind: strip mahjong. In the story mode, the hero visits different locations (mahjong parlor, shop, hospital, etc.) and plays mahjong with the pretty girls he finds there; after having won, he proceeds to the next location and next heroines. In the battle mode, the player can one or three others. After each successful mahjong round, the girl who lost removes an item of her clothes. As in other games by Sogna, the undressing sequences are fully animated. Animahjong X Perfect is an add-on for Animahjong X. It adds a four-player multiplayer mode as well as replay and music room options.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "December 9, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Sogna", "publishers": "Sogna", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/132543-animahjong-x-perfect\n"}
