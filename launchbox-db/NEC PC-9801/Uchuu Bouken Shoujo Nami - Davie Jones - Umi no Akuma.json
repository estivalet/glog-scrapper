{"altername_name": [], "name": "Uchuu Bouken Shoujo Nami: Davie Jones: Umi no Akuma", "overview": "In 2991 in addition to speed of light space navigation humankind acquired the technology of hyper jump system (HJS) from ruins of ancient alien civilization. The government now succeeded in production of minimized versions of such hyper portals and one such device was planted in the suitcase of space delivery company pilot Nami. Game is based on manga so it's very dense in details and elaborate in plot. It utilizes command selection bruteforcing. It's quite unexpected to see such an old-school space adventure in 1992. Anyway the game is quite an obscure one with too few reviews around to discuss its qualities.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "June 24, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Popcom Soft", "publishers": "Popcom Soft", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/139277-uchuu-bouken-shoujo-nami-davie-jones-umi-no-akuma\n"}
