{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gakuen Senshi: Sailor Fighter", "overview": "Minako was just an ordinary Japanese teenage girl - until she was killed by an evil gym teacher, whom she dared to oppose. However, she was resurrected with the help of cyborg technology, operated by a mysterious creature with a normal Japanese surname Yoda - and yes, he looks just like the famous character from Star Wars. Yoda explains to Minako that her school has been possessed by demons, one of which is her former gym teacher, now turned principal! Minako heads back to her school, determined to demonstrate her new skills to the forces of evil! Looks like all those cybernetic enhancements served just one purpose: enrich Minako's knowledge of contemporary Japanese pop culture. Because the only gameplay in this game involves answering timed trivia questions. The moment Minako encounters an opponent, the screen displays a fake battle field, and the quiz begins. If the player answers correctly, Minako causes damage to her opponent; if the answer is wrong, Minako sustains damage herself. Too many wrong answers result in Minako's death, this time irrevocable. Extensive cut-scenes occupy the space between those \"quiz battles\". Most of them are heavy on explicit sexual content.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "April 15, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Peach Soft", "publishers": "Peach Soft", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137215-gakuen-senshi-sailor-fighter\n"}
