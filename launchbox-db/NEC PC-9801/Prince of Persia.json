Now, working meticulously from hundreds of movie clips, he breaks new ground with animation so uncannily human it must be seen to be believed. Seventeen years have I, Jaffar, served as Grand Vizier to the Sultan of Persia. Now the hour of my triumph is at hand. Already I sit on his throne, and soon I shall have his daughter as well\u2014the Princess, whose beauty is like the stars and the moon. Of course, I would never force myself upon this lovely creature. I shall give her a full hour to reach her own decision. She shall choose me of her own free will\u2014or forfeit her life. And yet she clings to her fantasy of rescue. The object of her childish infatuation? A young adventurer\u2014a nobody\u2014 who is now, on my orders, a prisoner in my dungeons. There will be no rescue. He shall never leave his prison alive. Even should he escape his cell, he could never survive the cunning traps and palace guards barring him from the Princess. Yet suppose\u2014by some succession of miracles\u2014he prevails over all these? Ah, then I would be obliged to use certain forces of my own. Enchantment? Black magic? These are but words. I speak of mysteries. Mysteries that no man\u2014or woman\u2014can withstand. Fluid animation and quick, responsive controls.
