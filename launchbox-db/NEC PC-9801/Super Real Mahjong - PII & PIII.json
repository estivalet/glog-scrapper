{"altername_name": [], "name": "Super Real Mahjong: PII & PIII", "overview": "Super Real Mahjong PII & PIII is a compilation that contains Super Real Mahjong PII and Super Real Mahjong PIII, which were only released in the arcades as separate games. Both games are fairly straightforward one-on-one mahjong matches; the player can not select the opponent and the game is over when one round of mahjong is lost. The compilation features improved graphics and animation, as well as additional gameplay modes: four-player mahjong (in the computer versions) and versus mode, where the player can select opponents (in the PC Engine / TurboGrafx CD version).", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "SETA", "publishers": "Ving", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133444-super-real-mahjong-pii-piii\n"}
