{"altername_name": ["Fukkatusai: Asticaya no Mazyo"], "name": "Fukkatsusai: Astikaya no Majo", "overview": "A female demon has attacked Ayano, a student of the Asticaya High School, and killed her in a brutal way: to be able to remain young and pretty, she took her body. But the school science department, led by a genius Doctor, manages to revive Ayano's head and give her a new body. The only small, tiny, really insignificant problem is... this body is male! So now Ayano is a guy. She/he has to find the evil demon, but first, there is a lot to do in the school - evil has many forms... Fukkatsusai: Asticaya no Majo is an RPG with top-down navigation and random regular turn-based battles viewed from first-person perspective. Ayano and her/his party members can buy equipment and use items, and execute a variety of attacks during battles, physical as well as \"scientific\". Every attack depletes the characters' energy, so there is also a \"resting\" option to refill the energy bar. It is also possible to talk to the enemies and to solve conflicts peacefully - which is unfortunately not always possible.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "September 25, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Grocer", "publishers": "Grocer", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137202-fukkatsusai-astikaya-no-majo\n"}
