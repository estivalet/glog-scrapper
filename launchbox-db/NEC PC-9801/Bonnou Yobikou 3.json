{"altername_name": ["Bonn\u014d-Yobik\u014d 3"], "name": "Bonnou Yobikou 3", "overview": "Bonn\u014d-Yobik\u014d 3 is a quiz game. Unlike the previous game, it has a story with a protagonist: Miyake Kenichirou, a young man who is interested in two things: knowledge and pretty girls (aren't we all?..). He has heard of the famed Desires of Flesh Preparatory School (translation of the game's title), which is inhabited by gorgeous women. But in order to win their trust, the hero must prove his knowledge - mainly in anime and contemporary Japanese pop culture. The game has top-down view for school locations, and first-person view for the quiz parts. The navigation is extremely limited: basically, the hero is taken to the next room automatically and is unable to leave it until he competes against the girl that is standing there. The quiz sections come in different flavors: give enough correct answers in order to raise a bar and win the quiz; answer a series of timed questions; answer several questions correctly (a single wrong answer leading to Game Over), etc. Successfully completing a quiz rewards the player with an erotic picture.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "November 20, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Software House Parsley", "publishers": "Software House Parsley", "genres": "Quiz", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133260-bonnou-yobikou-3\n"}
