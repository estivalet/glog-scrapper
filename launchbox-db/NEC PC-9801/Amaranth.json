{"altername_name": [], "name": "Amaranth", "overview": "Trouble is in the kingdom of Stellar. The lovely princess has disappeared, and the king sends his best men to investigate. All they find on the spot where the princess has vanished is a confused young boy who has lost his memory and knows only his name: Liann. Since he still might have some connection to the princess' disappearance, the king sends Liann on a quest to find her. And perhaps along the way, the boy will be able to find the magic flower called Amaranth, that restores people's memories... Amaranth is a RPG with action-based combat. Enemies appear randomly, and Liann and his party members are taken to a separate battle screen. Attacks are performed by bumping into enemies, like in Ys series. The other party members are controlled by the AI. Equipment and items can be bought in town shops, and the heroes level up in a standard RPG fashion.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "December 14, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Fuga System", "publishers": "Fuga System", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/123360-amaranth\n"}
