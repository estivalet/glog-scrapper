{"altername_name": [], "name": "4D Boxing", "overview": "4-D Boxing leaves behind any pretences of being a pure arcade game based on boxing, and aims to recreate the sport in full detail. The graphics engine allows for multiple camera angles and viewpoints, and considerably detailed visuals. These required more advanced hardware than was common at the time, but a stick-figure mode was included as a compromise. The moves on offer include all the uppercuts and hooks of a real fight, and the players are designed to move realistically to implement them. You progress through the game by taking on a succession of increasingly difficult fighters, and get to train your boxer in between. Advanced action replays are included as well, so you can review all that happened.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "January 14, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Distinctive Software", "publishers": "Electronic Arts Victor", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/132520-4d-boxing\n"}
