{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tenshi-tachi no Gogo II: Minako", "overview": "The sequel to Tenshitachi no Gogo \"switches sides\"; instead of playing as the obnoxious male protagonist of the previous game, the player takes control of Minako, a female Japanese high-school student with a strong interest towards sexuality. The story mainly depicts Minako's sexual encounters with men and women, which take place on school grounds, in various locations of the city, etc. Tenshitachi no Gogo 2: Minako is an adventure game that has both text input and a set of verb commands (\"Search\", \"Look\", \"Go\", etc.) attached to the function keys. There are no puzzles, but not every event in the game can be triggered by using the pre-set commands; often it is required to type in other verbs, using hiragana (Japanese syllable system) input via the keyboard.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "JAST", "publishers": "Jast", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147874-tenshi-tachi-no-gogo-ii-minako\n"}
