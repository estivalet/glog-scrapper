{"altername_name": ["Ginga Eiy\u016b Densetsu IV", "Ginga Eiyu Densetsu 4"], "name": "Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu IV", "overview": "The fourth game in the series based on the anime adaptation of Yoshiki Tanaka's Legend of the Galactic Heroes science fiction novels. The novels (and the games) are set in a futuristic world, where humanity has conquered the entire Milky Way and split into two powerful warring states, each encompassing different systems and planets: the Galactic Empire (modeled after Bismark's 19th century Prussia), and the democratic Free Planets Alliance. Ginga Eiy\u016b Densetsu IV follows the model used in the third game, rather the pure combat-oriented gameplay of the first two. It expands and refines the gameplay elements that were first introduced in its predecessor. The player chooses the main \"playable character\", i.e. the commander of the entire army (Imperial or Alliance) from a list of generals. Financial management is more in-depth; including budget-planning, funds management, salaries, etc. Sending space ships to conquer and defend planets is done the same way as in the previous game. In fact, the preparations turn into the core of the gameplay, and it is possible to disable the actual combat phases. If it is enabled, the combat evolves in a fashion similar to the previous games: the player engages enemy ships in turn-based fashion, and combat is shown as animated scenes. There are more ship types with unique names and abilities, as well as massive attacks that can be performed by the forces stationed on the planet.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "December 9, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bothtec", "publishers": "Bothtec", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133349-ginga-eiyuu-densetsu-iv\n"}
