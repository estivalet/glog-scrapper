{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mokkoriman RPG", "overview": "The hero of the game is a seemingly ordinary man named Kaneda Momezo. But in fact he is not an ordinary man at all, but a superhero called \"Mokkoriman\", a name which is derived from the Japanese word for the \"splash!\" sound usually associated with sex. Young girls have been kidnapped and turned into seductive, but deadly monsters, who kill people with lethal attacks called SEX. It's time for the Mokkoriman to show his true face! With the help of his two superhero-aiding pretty girls, Mokkoriman is out for justice, revenge, and mutual SEX. Mokkoriman RPG mostly plays like a traditional top-down Japanese RPG, with world map, random turn-based battles, party management, levels, equipment, and everything else, albeit with a definite comedic undertone: the enemies are naked girls, regular attacks are called \"sex\" (with choices of one-on-one or group), instead of magic there is \"dirty talk\", and health is restored by reading Japanese porn magazines. The game is very heavy on explicit sexual content; even during regular battles the attacks are animated in a very suggestive way. The game marks the beginning of Illusion's career as the maker of interactive sex scenes. The sexual encounters in Mokkoriman RPG have their own gameplay, which involves manipulating the mouse to simulate the movements of the player character during intimate moments. Some of the sex scenes are animated, making the game a RPG pioneer in this field.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "June 24, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Illusion", "publishers": "Illusion", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137477-mokkoriman-rpg\n"}
