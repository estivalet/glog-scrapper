{"altername_name": [], "name": "Star Trap", "overview": "A space ship was sent to the planet Neptune, to investigate strange disturbances spotted on the planet's surface. Some time later, the nearest space station picked up a SOS signal from the ship. An agent named Takuya, in command of an elite team of female fighters, is sent to Neptune. But their ship crashes, and Takuya must fight for his life and the lives of the girls, which are threatened by Neptune's fearsome monsters. Star Trap is an adult visual novel. The gameplay consists entirely of making choices. The choices are always situation-specific and don't allow any real interaction with the environment; there is no fixed verb-based menu. Rather than influencing the main story, the choices made by the player unlock (or lock) the CG, most of which are dedicated to various acts of sexual nature.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "January 26, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Fairy Dust", "publishers": "Fairy Dust", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137636-star-trap\n"}
