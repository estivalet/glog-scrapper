{"altername_name": [], "name": "Coming Heart", "overview": "The hero of this game is a teenage boy who failed his high-school examination; as a result, his parents decided to transfer him to a special school in another city. The young hero is at first sad and depressed, but soon discovers that the situation might not be so bad after all: the mansion in which he is going to leave is not empty, and his neighbors are all young pretty girls... Coming Heart is a standard low-interaction Japanese adventure, with the omni-present \"Look-Talk-Think\" commands, occasionally accompanied by \"Move\". On a few occasions there are some dialogue choices, which might lock/unlock certain scenes. The sex scenes are non-interactive.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "November 10, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "May-Be Soft", "publishers": "May-Be Soft", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137103-coming-heart\n"}
