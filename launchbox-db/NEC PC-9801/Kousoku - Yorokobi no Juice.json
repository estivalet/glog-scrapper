Keisuke accepts and meets her family, which leads to unexpected and dark erotic adventures... K\u014dsoku: Yorokobi no Juice is a typical Japanese-style adventure. It is set entirely in the mansion and has a standard command menu (\"Examine\", \"Talk\", \"Move\") appearing on almost every screen. It is not always necessary to deplete all the commands on screen to trigger an event; also, the player is able, for the most time, to choose which room to visit, which might lead to different events.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "July 28, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Persian Soft", "publishers": "Persian Soft", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147748-kousoku-yorokobi-no-juice\n"}
