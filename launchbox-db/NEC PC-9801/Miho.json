{"altername_name": [], "name": "Miho", "overview": "Miho is dedicated to predominantly sexual experiences of a Japanese young woman named Miho during her work at a hospital as a nurse. The game's story is rather sparse, consisting of various encounters with doctors, staff members, and patients, most of which lead to sexual scenes, often with unsavory medical undertones and torture. The interaction consists of selection of context-specific commands (which usually include \"Look\" and \"Talk\"); typically, most or all options have to be depleted before the player can move to the next section of the game.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "January 28, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Red Zone", "publishers": "IDES", "genres": "Visual Novel", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/141568-miho\n"}
