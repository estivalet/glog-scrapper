{"altername_name": [], "name": "Viper V16", "overview": "Unlike the previous Viper V games, Viper V-16 includes only two stories instead of the usual three. The stories are called Rise and Imagine. Rise tells the story of Akira, a young girl who works in the Anna Miller restaurant chain in Japan. Beside being a waitress, she is also a skillful martial artist. One day she and two other girls are kidnapped by mysterious creatures, who turn out to be a subterranean race that needs human females for reproduction. Will Akira manage to escape and rescue her friends, or will the three girls remain forever in the hands of the cruel captors and their horrifying leader Seed? Imagine tells a quieter story without any supernatural elements. The protagonist is a male high school student who is looking for a girlfriend (aren't they all?..). He meets three interesting girls, one of which dreams to be a voice actress, the other is an aspiring musician, while the third is unsure about her future. Who will be the lucky one to end up with our hero? The two stories are more developed compared to the previous Viper-V short stories. As always, there are animated scenes with sexual content in the game; the interaction is once again confined to occasional choices. In Rise, wrong choices usually lead to bad endings; in Imagine, the hero ends up with different girls depending on the player's decisions.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "December 22, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Sogna", "publishers": "Sogna", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133093-viper-v16\n"}
