{"altername_name": [], "name": "Another Genesis", "overview": "The young Jin has grown up in a quiet secluded hut in a peaceful family, thinking it was his own. But when he turns sixteen, he finds out that he was adopted; on a rainy night, he was found outside of the hut. His mother, dying from numerous wounds, gave his adoptive family a sword and a letter which explained that Jin was destined to prevent a resurrection of an evil demon lord once he turned seventeen. Jin leaves his home and embarks on the perilous journey that will shape his destiny... Another Genesis is a rather simple and very traditional Japanese-style RPG. The player navigates the hero(es) through the top-down world, visiting towns, buying weapons and armor, descending into dungeons, and fighting randomly (though surprisingly infrequently) appearing enemies in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. The game's graphical and gameplay style are heavily influenced by early Dragon Quest, including a similar interaction menu with options such as \"Talk\" and \"Door\".", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "June 21, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Soft Plan", "publishers": "Soft Plan", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133253-another-genesis\n"}
