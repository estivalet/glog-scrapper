{"altername_name": [], "name": "Venus", "overview": "Venus is a fairly simple dating simulation game. The player controls a man named Saeki who gets acquainted with four young women, three Japanese and one Western. Each girl has her own preferences as well as parameters that describe her feelings towards the protagonist. The goal is to raise these parameters (and ultimately the girls' \"love level\") by repeatedly going on dates. From time to time the player is required to make choices that would influence subsequent dating. There is an internal clock that is advanced every time the player character goes on a date. Successful dating results in explicit erotic scenes.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "June 29, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Software House Parsley", "publishers": "Software House Parsley", "genres": "Life Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137154-venus\n"}
