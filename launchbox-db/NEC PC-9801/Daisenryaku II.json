{"altername_name": [], "name": "Daisenryaku II", "overview": "Daisenryaku II is the second main installment in the turn-based war strategy series. Like its predecessor, the game puts the player in the role of a commander of an army that must defeat an opposing force on a given map within a certain amount of turns. The player has to manage unit production, deliver supply vehicles, and navigate infantry, tanks, aircraft and ships on a hex-based grid map, trying to conquer the opponent's cities and strategic locations. The main new feature of this installment is the introduction of two additional possible belligerents (\"green\" and \"yellow\"), along with the old \"blue\" and \"red\". Any of the four sides can be assigned to be controlled by either a human player or the computer AI. Many of the maps may feature only two or three sides, but some offer a full-scale war between four armies. A few maps are based on real geographical areas (e.g. Italy), or may allude to a historical conflict, such as the conquests of the Roman Empire; weapons and vehicles, however, are always modern.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "March 20, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "SystemSoft", "publishers": "SystemSoft", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/154566-daisenryaku-ii\n"}
