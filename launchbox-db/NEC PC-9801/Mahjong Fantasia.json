{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mahjong Fantasia", "overview": "Mahjong Fantasia is, as the name implies, a mahjong game set in a medieval fantasy world. The story mode is divided between cut-scenes that advance the plot of the game, and the actual mahjong \"battles\". The story centers around an evil witch called Belladonna, who can only be defeated with the sacred power of the 136 mahjong stones. The protagonist is a young \"mahjong warrior\" Ring, who must win a mahjong tournament in order to seal Belladonna once and for all. In addition to the story mode, there are versus mode, which allows the player to choose any character to fight against in four rounds of mahjong, as well as \"vs. computer\" mode, which allows playing mahjong against computer AI. Both story mode and versus mode deal exclusively with mahjong parties played against young, pretty, female opponents. In both modes, they undress when defeated. The story mode features many other story-related scenes with nudity.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "June 6, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Active Software", "publishers": "Active Software", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133471-mahjong-fantasia\n"}
