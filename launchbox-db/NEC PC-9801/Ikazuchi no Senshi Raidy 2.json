{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ikazuchi no Senshi Raidy 2", "overview": "In this sequel to Ikazuchi no Senshi Raidi, the fearless (and good-looking) female warrior Raidi is wandering through a desert. Finally she reaches a small town, only to discover that its inhabitants are being abducted by mysteriously looking creatures. The trace leads to an abandoned mansion not far away from the town. Armed with the power of lightning, Raidi steps into the mansion, hoping to unravel the mystery and to find the missing villagers. The sequel has the same core gameplay: explore huge maze-like pseudo-3D dungeons, fighting randomly appearing enemies (demonic, female, sexy, under-dressed) in turn-based combat. Raidi still fights alone in this sequel, without a party to aid her. There are, however, some additions: several dungeons instead of one, and a town where Raidi can rest and buy supplies. Just like the first game, encounters with enemies end in the enemies losing whatever clothes they still had on in the beginning of the fight.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "ZyX", "publishers": "ZyX", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137316-ikazuchi-no-senshi-raidy-2\n"}
