{"altername_name": [], "name": "Karei naru Jinsei 2", "overview": "Karei naru Jinsei 2 is a board/dating simulation game, very similar to its predecessor. As in the first game, players can compete against each other or against computer AI in an adult-themed board game, with the eventual goal of having sex with various female characters. There are more girls and a larger variety of items to buy than in the first game. There are specialized shops (boutique, adult, etc.) which offer more items for sale. The basic gameplay is the same (each player starts a \"roulette\" which determines the amount of squares he can move on the board). However, an additional \"event roulette\" has been added, which resembles a slot machine. This roulette influences the player characters' parameters, money, etc.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "November 22, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "FairyTale", "publishers": "FairyTale", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "5", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137394-karei-naru-jinsei-2\n"}
