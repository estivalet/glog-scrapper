{"altername_name": [], "name": "Wrestle Angels Special: M\u014d Hitori no Top Eventer", "overview": "Wrestle Angels Special follows the same gameplay template as its predecessors in the series. Unlike in the previous games, however, the player creates two female wrestlers. After naming them, the player is taken to a character screen, which allows him to choose wrestling moves that will be used in the upcoming battles. After that, the tournament begins. As before, the wrestling matches are turn-based, both sides choosing a move from several available ones. It is also possible to set the matches on auto, letting the computer AI choose the moves, in case the player is sure the best moves were assigned before the match. There is also an exhibition mode, which allows the player to choose any wrestler and to have a single match against any other.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "February 10, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Communication Group Plum", "publishers": "Great", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/130953-wrestle-angels-special-mo-hitori-no-top-eventer\n"}
