{"altername_name": [], "name": "Moonlight Energy 2", "overview": "Moonlight Energy 2 is a sequel to Moonlight Energy. The game's premise is nearly identical to that of the predecessor: the player controls a high school student named Maki, participating in her lesbian escapades with other students or personnel. Unlike the first game, this is a visual novel with minimal interaction. The player is only occasionally prompted to make a choice for Maki. Some of the scenes, in particular sexual ones, are animated.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "December 1, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Inter Heart", "publishers": "Inter Heart", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137479-moonlight-energy-2\n"}
