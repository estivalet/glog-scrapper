{"altername_name": [], "name": "Alice-tachi no Gogo Vol. 2", "overview": "As the name implies, this is the continuation of Alice-tachi no Gogo Vol. 1. The two volumes were released as separate game packages, but they can be considered two parts of the same game. The second volume has exactly the same story as the first: as a journalist working for a company named \"Oh!\", the player has to explore a huge Expo area and take pictures of as many pretty girls as possible, preferably undressed. The gameplay is identical to the first volume. The protagonist procures items or information to access new areas of the Expo, and deals with the girls in the pavilions in a RPG-like fashion, gaining \"good feeling\" (experience points) when trying to convince a girl to undress, at the same time losing \"spirit\" (hit points). Selling photos of the girls brings money, which in its turn is spent on healing and other items. What prevents this second volume from being exactly the same game as the first is a completely different layout of the Expo, somewhat increased difficulty level, and - naturally - an all-new cast of pretty girls waiting to be undressed.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "December 1, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "New System House Oh!", "publishers": "New System House Oh!", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147565-alice-tachi-no-gogo-vol-2\n"}
