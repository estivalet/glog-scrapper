{"altername_name": ["Onigashirajima Joshi Keimusho", "Kitou Mashi Shioshi Keimeshiyo"], "name": "Kitoushima Joshi Keimusho", "overview": "On a secluded island known as Onigashira stands a prison for women. In this prison, inmates are being methodically raped and tortured by wardens. The player is invites to witness the events that take place in the prison from the point of view of five characters: two prisoners, the lovely 23-year-old Chika Kanzawa and the innocent teenager Miki; the sadistic female warden Enko, the police officer Otonashi Youichirou, and a mysterious man known as Seiki, who has his own agenda. Kit\u014dshima Joshi Keimusho is a very short game that consists almost entirely of sex scenes, most of which depict rape. The only available interaction is the possibility to see the events through the eyes of five different characters. The player can switch to another character after each short scene. It is therefore impossible to see all the scenes during one play-through. The events of the game unfold regardless of the player's decision to switch characters, and the player is offered no other choices.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "November 2, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Illusion", "publishers": "Illusion", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147745-kitoushima-joshi-keimusho\n"}
