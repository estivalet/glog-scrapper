{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pink Sox 6", "overview": "Pink Sox 6 is a collection of adult-themed mini-games in various genres. It includes the conclusion of the sci-fi adventure Who Is There from the previous games, as well as a new chapter in the Balancing Beam of Love, introducing a new heroine in a superhero comic book-like setting. There are two new mini-games: the first, entitled PC City, consists of a floating island and a few scenes (mostly involving young women) that occur when the player accesses various locations on it (such as a ship, an observatory, a medieval castle, etc.). The second mini-game is sub-titled Let's Zazen and depicts a comical Zen lesson as the player switches between pupils trying to avoid the master's blows.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "November 15, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Wendy Magazine", "publishers": "Wendy Magazine", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137712-pink-sox-6\n"}
