{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gakuen Monogatari: Ikenai Houkago", "overview": "By the end of the 20th century, women have acquired a prominent role in the human society. Entertainment, arts, and politics are increasingly dominated by women. Therefore, a special emphasis is put on educating young women, preparing them for the turbulent social life. The world's most prestigious educational institution is the Japanese Eikou High School. Becoming a teacher in that school is the highpoint of the career of the protagonist, Takigawa Noboru. But as it always happens (well, at least in bish\u014djo games), the moment the hero encounters all those gorgeous female colleagues and students, he forgets all about education... Ikenai H\u014dkago is a rather traditional Japanese-style adventure. It is set entirely in the school, and includes typical sub-locations such as classrooms, gym, teachers room, tennis court, etc. Every screen is accompanied by the verb commands Look, Talk, Examine, and Move. There are no sub-menus for interaction with objects. The player is mostly free to wander around the school (via the Move commands in the menu), but events are usually \"triggered\" by repeatedly visiting different locations.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "July 17, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Peach Soft", "publishers": "Peach Soft", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137211-gakuen-monogatari-ikenai-houkago\n"}
