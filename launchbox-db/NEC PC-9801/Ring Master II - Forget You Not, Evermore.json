{"altername_name": ["Ring Master II"], "name": "Ring Master II: Forget You Not, Evermore", "overview": "The sequel to The Shadow of Filias directly continues the story that began in that games. After the small country Filias Nogis was overrun by the forces of Tonade Ralei, the brave Ring Knight traveled there and attempted to liberate it. However, gradually it became clear that evil supernatural forces are controlling this invasion, and that the power of the legendary Sun Sword might be the clue to the solution. Gameplay-wise, the sequel is very similar to its predecessor, with nearly identical visuals and system. Like in the first game, character development includes four main attributes as well as a variety of skills. Equipped weapons are distinguished by damage types, which also belong to the player character's parameters and can be improved. Turn-based first-person battles involve simple commands, but once other characters join the main hero it becomes possible to manage their formation.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "April 7, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hobby Japan", "publishers": "Hobby Japan", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133415-ring-master-ii-forget-you-not-evermore\n"}
