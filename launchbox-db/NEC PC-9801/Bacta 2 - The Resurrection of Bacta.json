{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bacta 2: The Resurrection of Bacta", "overview": "The sequel to Bacta directly continues the story initiated in the first game. The paranormal investigator Jinpachi Tanaka was unable to defeat the female demon Dirsala, and she intends to resurrect the mysterious magical creation known as Bacta. In order to prevent that Jinpachi must work together with the local police and his faithful assistance, all the while continuing to save young women from demonic possession in his own unique ways. Gameplay-wise, the sequel is identical to the predecessor. The Japanese-style adventure gameplay relies on selecting verb commands and combining them with objects in a text menu. It is impossible to get stuck or permanently die in the game, and many of the options, though not necessary to select for triggering the next event, are there for humorous reasons.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "February 5, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Himeya Soft, Inc", "publishers": "Himeya Soft, Inc", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137059-bacta-2-the-resurrection-of-bacta\n"}
