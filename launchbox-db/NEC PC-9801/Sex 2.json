{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sex 2", "overview": "Sex 2 has the same basic premise as its predecessor, which is easy to deduce from the game's title. It's all about engaging in the titular pleasurable activity, and doing it in various \"creative\" ways. Unlike the first Sex, there is only one girl in Sex 2: Ayaka, the cute flower-raising character from Satyr, another game by the same company. As in Satyr, the player character default name is Momojirou (nicknamed Momo-chan), and he is Ayaka's boyfriend. There is no real story in the game; Momojirou visits Ayaka at her flower shop every day and has sex with her. However, events might occur between their sexual encounters, adding an item to the hero's inventory, which can later be used for their mutual pleasure. There is no way to \"lose\" the game, but in order to unlock all the graphics, the player has to experiment with various precise sexual choices and items that are at his disposal.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "March 1, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Aypio", "publishers": "Aypio", "genres": "Life Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "0.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133486-sex-2\n"}
