{"altername_name": ["Uch\u016b no Kishi Tekkaman Blade: Orbital Ring Dakkai Sakusen", "Tekkaman Blade"], "name": "Uchuu no Kishi Tekkaman Blade", "overview": "Based on the anime series Tekkaman Blade. In the year 2087, the Earth is attacked by an alien race known as Radam. Assisting the army of aliens are Tekkamen, powerful armored creatures who turn out to be humans brainwashed by the Radam to further their military causes. Blade is the nickname of one of these Tekkamen, the only one who is able to withstand the brainwashing and help the humans to avert the alien menace. This interpretation of the anime is a real-time strategy game (RTS). Most of the game consists of large-scale battles between the army led by Blade and the aliens or enemy Tekkamen. The player most order his troops to move, attack, and employ various strategies in real time. Player-controlled army includes plot-related characters (such as Blade himself), as well as \"nameless\" human troops and robots. Once one of the player-controlled characters is in the proximity of an enemy unit, a semi-automatic battle sequence ensues. During these battles, the player is only able to choose special attacks (if any) for the character in question, or retreat. Otherwise, the character and the enemy will exchange attacks according to their parameters. Victory conditions vary from mission to mission, but mostly involve defending a certain position or eliminating all enemy troops. Cut scenes between the missions advance the story.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "August 26, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Matrix", "publishers": "Matrix", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/129037-uchuu-no-kishi-tekkaman-blade\n"}
