{"altername_name": [], "name": "Valentine Kiss: BirthDays 2", "overview": "Valentine Kiss is a dating simulation game, very similar to Birthdays, only instead of \"conquering\" a girl as a birthday present, the goal here is to \"score\" on Valentine's Day. The actual gameplay is nearly identical to that of Birthdays, with a few interface changes and minor tweaks (for example, the game pauses automatically to remind the player of his alter ego's date). There are only four girls here, and the protagonist meets them right at the beginning, as opposed to Birthdays, where there were eight different girls met at different locations. There are, however, more detailed conversations with the girls, and some new choices during dates (such as holding hands, etc.). There are explicit sex scenes, but they only appear during the game's endings.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "February 9, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Silky's", "publishers": "Silky's", "genres": "Life Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137689-valentine-kiss-birthdays-2\n"}
