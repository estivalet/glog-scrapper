{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gambler: Queen's Cup", "overview": "Gambler Queen's Cup is primarily a dating simulation game. The player controls a male protagonist whose goal is to date and eventually have sexual intercourse with three young women he meets at the club. Each date has higher or lower chances of success depending on the amount of money invested in it. Dates are presented as still anime-style images depicting the girl and whatever location the meeting takes place in. A set list of conversation topics is available, as well as a point-and-click interface allowing limited interaction with the environment. In order to gain more money needed for the dating the player character can bet on horses participating in races. The gambling system is quite simple and only gives general information concerning horses and their standings. The game also offers a training mode that only includes the gambling, with the dating elements omitted.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "July 22, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Queen Soft", "publishers": "Queen Soft", "genres": "Life Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147698-gambler-queens-cup\n"}
