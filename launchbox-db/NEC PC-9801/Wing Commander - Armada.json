{"altername_name": [], "name": "Wing Commander: Armada", "overview": "A strategy game base upon the popular Wing Commander Universe. This game sees you in command of either the Terran or Kilrathi empires in a bid to conquer a sector of space. This game provided 2 distinct modes of play with Armada being entirely tactically based and a far easier quick play method much like the mission creation facilities of Chuck Yeager's Air Combat of 5 years previous. This game also featured multi-player support both in Quick play and Armada modes. The game could be played either in split-screen, network, serial or modem modes and was one of the first multi-player 3D space sims.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "July 28, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "ORIGIN Systems, Inc.", "publishers": "Electronic Arts Victor", "genres": "Flight Simulator", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.75", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_Commander:_Armada", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133095-wing-commander-armada\n"}
