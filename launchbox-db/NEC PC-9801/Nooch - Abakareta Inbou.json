{"altername_name": [], "name": "Nooch: Abakareta Inbou", "overview": "The protagonist of the game is a rather nerdy Japanese teenager named Umechiyo, who impatiently awaits the arrival of his friend, a foreign girl named Piliru who comes to visit Japan. However, it appears that Piliru possesses knowledge of shady activities going on in her homeland, the fictional country of Paru. Pursuers are on their way, and the hero has no choice but protect the girl at all costs. Nooch is a Japanese-style adventure game. The player interacts with the environment by selecting verb commands (Look, Talk, Think, and others) from a menu, sometimes combining them with objects from a list. On many occasions it is necessary to exhaust all commands to trigger a scene. It is also possible to move between locations via a menu command.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "November 13, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Soft House Bon bee Bon Bon", "publishers": "Soft House Bon bee Bon Bon", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137494-nooch-abakareta-inbou\n"}
