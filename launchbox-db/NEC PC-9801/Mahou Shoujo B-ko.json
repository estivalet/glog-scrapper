{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mahou Shoujo B-ko", "overview": "B-Ko is a princess from a magical dimension, who is having a vacation on the earth, masquerading as a student in the Catholic St. Rapahel High School. This peaceful (and pleasant) time-passing ends when the evil witch Saprinu appears in our dimension and attacks B-Ko. Saprinu's demonic plan is to steal precious energy from female virgins. Now it's time for B-Ko's faithful servant, a young man known as Alpha, to \"intercept\" the poor virgins (using his own methods), before they fall prey to Saprinu... Mah\u014d Sh\u014djo B-Ko walks a fine line between an adventure game (Japanese-style) and visual novel; the interaction is very limited, with only three commands (Look, Talk, Move) and no sub-menus. It also features navigation (menu-based) through various parts of the school. Some conversations offer dialogue choices, typically for visual novels.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "March 15, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Scoop Software Productions", "publishers": "Scoop Software Productions", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137446-mahou-shoujo-b-ko\n"}
