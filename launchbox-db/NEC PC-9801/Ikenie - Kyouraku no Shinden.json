{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ikenie: Kyouraku no Shinden", "overview": "This short game has a rather cryptic plot. The identity of the hero is unclear: we know only that he is a young male, most probably living in our time. One day he is resting after having had sex with a girl, and is mysteriously transported into a strange temple. Without knowing what this temple is, and only presuming it must be built by the Aztecs of Yucatan, the hero must find a way out of it, and back home. Ikenie: Ky\u014draku no Shinden is an adventure game. Unlike most Japanese adventures, there is real movement in the game. The entire game takes place in the temple. The hero moves through the maze-like corridors of the huge temple, viewed from first-person perspective, in dungeon crawler style (with auto-map). However, there is no combat or hero statistics of any kind. The goal of the game is to find rooms with beautiful women in them, and select the correct dialogue choices in order to satisfy them sexually - which will make them open doors for the hero, allowing access to other areas of the temple. The sexual encounters are interactive, utilizing a point-and-click interface with selectable cursors for looking, touching, using tongue, and even a special cursor shaped like a penis, whose function is... not very difficult to deduce.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Cat's Pro", "publishers": "Cat's Pro", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137317-ikenie-kyouraku-no-shinden\n"}
