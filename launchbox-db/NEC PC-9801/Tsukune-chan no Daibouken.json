{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tsukune-chan no Daibouken", "overview": "Tsukune is a 16-year old girl who works as a witch's apprentice. Today is the test day for becoming a witch and she forgot her magic pants! Ugh, this work is ugly for 1991. And it has enormous number of commands which make gameplay lacking as never before. The number of commands needed to select can easily surpass a hundred. I'm not joking. Game feels like it was abandoned since the start of 80s and then forced to production.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "June 28, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Game Technopolis", "publishers": "Game Technopolis", "genres": "Visual Novel", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/142170-tsukune-chan-no-daibouken\n"}
