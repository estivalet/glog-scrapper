Fermion: Mirai kara no H\u014dmonsha is a Japanese-style adventure game; typically, the player is shown anime-style pictures, with the possibility to click on the commands \"Look\", \"Think\", and \"Talk\". Usually, advancing to the next scene is triggered by depleting all the options. There is no movement of any kind in the game. The largest part of the game is dedicated to sex scenes, all of them lesbian (there are no male characters in the game). During the sex scenes, the menu commands sometimes change to precise actions of sexual nature. There are also a few points when the player can make a decision, which leads to slightly altered story development.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "December 22, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Silky's", "publishers": "Silky's", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147633-fermion-mirai-kara-no-houmonsha\n"}
