{"altername_name": [], "name": "Paragon Sexa Doll", "overview": "Two stars had military agreements to avoid conflict, but a war broke out from conflict on unmanned planet Alpha. Many sex doll robots were upgraded to execute military functions. Sex Doll Tina volunteered to avenge for her friend Barbara who got caught with spying charges. This work is a black sheep no matter how you look at it. The content is all age - that's something extraordinary for pc-98 game. Development is heavy and very serious. A lot of commands are used and the same screen can last for a very long time. The girls here aren't cute, but graphics are strangely impressive. The sound support is on par to it - it really fits the situation. But what impresses the newer generation is the amount of animation used in this work. That's a definite masterpiece.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "November 21, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Heart Soft", "publishers": "Heart Soft", "genres": "Visual Novel", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/146099-paragon-sexa-doll\n"}
