{"altername_name": ["Shiritsu Tantei Max: Senny\u016b!! Nazo no Joshik\u014d"], "name": "Shiritsu Tantei Max: Sennyuu!! Nazo no Joshikou", "overview": "Max is a private detective who is known - beside his investigative and combat skills - for his way with women. One day, he receives just the case he was hoping for: he has to travel to a remote space colony near the Sun - more precisely, to the women school in this colony. The principal of the school has committed suicide. Two agents that were sent to the colony disappeared under mysterious circumstances. It's time for Max to find out what's going on - an interesting side-quest to his main mission: have sex with as many girls as possible! Shiritsu Tantei Max: Sennyuu!! Nazo no Joshikou is primarily an adventure game. Although there are randomly appearing enemies and combat in the game, there are no character statistics of any kind, and no strategy needed for combat: Max simply has to periodically reload his gun to stay alive. The movement is done entirely on the location map, with Max represented as a small dot. The player moves this dot around by using arrow keys; whenever Max reaches a location with a character, the player can choose to initiate conversation. Talking to different characters and gaining access to new locations is the main bulk of the gameplay. The game has sexual scenes.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Agumix", "publishers": "Agumix", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133432-shiritsu-tantei-max-sennyuu-nazo-no-joshikou\n"}
