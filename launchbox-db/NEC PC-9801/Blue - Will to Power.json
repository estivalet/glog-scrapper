{"altername_name": [], "name": "Blue: Will to Power", "overview": "The kingdom of Ishut was the most powerful on the continent and considered the protector of peace. That peace was disrupted when the Northern neighbor Seden attacked without warning. After a prolonged war, an Ishut knight named Gene, valiant in battle and skillful in diplomacy, married Claire, the daughter of Duke of Seden, consolidating the peaceful co-existence between the two countries. However, Gene perished in a rebellion that arose in Seden. His son, blessed by his noble ancestors, has to follow his footsteps and bring peace and glory to his homeland. Blue: Will to Power is a Japanese-style role-playing game with many traditional elements of the genre, including top-down world map navigation, turn-based combat, simple leveling system, etc. A stand-out feature that the game shares with other Kinpukurin RPGs is the conversation system. Each NPC can be approached with any of the four requests: information, joining, negotiation, and battle. Many NPCs would agree to join the party, which can become considerably large for that reason.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "January 17, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Kinpukurin", "publishers": "Kinpukurin", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137075-blue-will-to-power\n"}
