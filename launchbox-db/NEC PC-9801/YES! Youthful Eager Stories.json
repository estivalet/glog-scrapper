{"altername_name": [], "name": "YES! Youthful Eager Stories", "overview": "A collection of three short stories: 1) \"Last kingdom\" is about the queen being escorted out of the kingdom by the guards due to the order of the king who is about to meet kingdom destruction. 2) \"BT-3\" is a love story between the android BT-3 who suffers a space shuttle crash and a local girl, who gets involved in fight after pursuers find the crash location. 3) \"Western mansion vampire\" is a about a school girl who enters a western mansion to rescue her friend who was missing after visiting that place. Whoa, even Himeya Soft followed the craze and made its own multiple stories game. But unlike the other companies these three stories are short and ero-centered, but scenario driven and and intriguing to read. Both character design and CG styles are familiar to me, so I enjoyed the work moderately.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "March 12, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Himeya Soft, Inc", "publishers": "Himeya Soft, Inc", "genres": "Visual Novel", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/146506-yes-youthful-eager-stories\n"}
