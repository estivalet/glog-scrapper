{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dezeni Land", "overview": "Dezeni Land is a text adventure with graphics. The game's nameless protagonist must visit six attractions parodying well-known areas of Tokyo Disneyland of the early 1980's, find the treasures within and escape. The title itself is a pun involving Disney and a Japanese expression referring showing off one's wealth. The gameplay largely follows the standards of interactive fiction, including simple verb-noun combinations as well as directions (forward, back, left, and right) for navigation. The areas are accessed in a linear fashion; items needed to advance to the next attraction can only be founded in an earlier explored location.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "December 1, 1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hudson Soft", "publishers": "Hudson Soft", "genres": "Visual Novel", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/146514-dezeni-land\n"}
