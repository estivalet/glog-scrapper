{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tania", "overview": "Tania is an Adventure game, developed and published by Tips, which was released in Japan in 1996 19th century. Girl Tania is born in a well-off family. But at the age of 6 a pillar of light pierced the girl making her faint and leaving a black mole on her chest. Now when the little girl grew into a young lady she starts to see strange dreams and to have strange desires... I did not find reviews on the game, but the game develops mostly as an eroge and the inner demon inside Tania literally shows up and soaks the house with blood. Not sure if there's also a good ending to all that.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "November 1, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Tips", "publishers": "Tips", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137684-tania\n"}
