{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tenshi-tachi no Gogo Collection 2", "overview": "Tenshitachi no Gogo Collection 2 contains remakes of three Tenshitachi no Gogo games: Tenshitachi no Gogo 2: Bangai-hen Tenshitachi no Gogo 3: Bangai-hen Tenshitachi no Gogo 4 These re-made versions were not released separately, outside of this collection. All the three remakes have more advanced graphics compared to the original versions; some of the pictures were re-drawn. Tenshitachi no Gogo 4 plays identically to the original version. The remakes of the two other games feature mouse support as well as interface modifications. Command menus have been simplified, with less verbs and objects to interact with. Many of the \"triggering\" commands were changed, even though at most points going through all the commands (often more than once) is still required to advance the game.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "November 17, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "JAST", "publishers": "Jast", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/149263-tenshi-tachi-no-gogo-collection-2\n"}
