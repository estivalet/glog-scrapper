{"altername_name": [], "name": "Erotic Baka Novel: Denwa no Bell ga...", "overview": "The protagonist of this game, a nameless young man, receives a phone call from his girlfriend. She is distressed and asks him to meet her immediately. From that point on, whatever happens depends on what the player decides to do... Erotic Baka Novel: Denwa no Bell ga... is a visual novel in its core, but with so many choices and story branches that it becomes a choose-your-own-adventure game. Every screen presents two choices, and every choice changes the narrative, often in such a drastic way that the actual \"story\" of this game is impossible to summarize. Depending on the player's choices, the hero can become involved in a wide variety of activities, meet many different women, end up drunk, imprisoned, killed, or simply sit at home and play computer games. Reaching different endings adds to the completion percentage of the game, rather than simply being dead ends. The actual goal of the game becomes less to find the \"right\" combination of decisions or reach the best ending, than explore every avenue and see as much content as the game is able to offer.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "August 17, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Cocktail Soft", "publishers": "Cocktail Soft", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137167-erotic-baka-novel-denwa-no-bell-ga\n"}
