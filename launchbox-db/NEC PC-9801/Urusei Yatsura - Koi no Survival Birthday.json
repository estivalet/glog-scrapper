{"altername_name": ["Urusei Yatsura: Koi no Survival Party"], "name": "Urusei Yatsura: Koi no Survival Birthday", "overview": "Scenario is original from the anime. We get and invitation to Okiko birthday party. The person who finds her first is going to get a kiss, so a fierce competition among the invited guests ensues. The mansion is a maze with lots of traps laid about. The characters are carefully transferred from the anime so it's needed to know the original to get the most of fun. It's possible either to go the shortest way or to eliminate all the other competitors, so it can be considered multiple-branch story. The ending also depends on how other characters are dealt with so it's multiple endings as well. The system is command selection, but the number of commands is quite large, so the difficulty level is really high. In the early visual novels years lots of works were clinging desperately to the popularity of anime franchises, but this work is really well done and it shows how a game can be better in many elements than the original anime.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Arrow Soft", "publishers": "Micro Cabin", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/129038-urusei-yatsura-koi-no-survival-birthday\n"}
