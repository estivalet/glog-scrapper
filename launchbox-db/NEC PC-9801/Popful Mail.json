{"altername_name": ["Popful Mail: Magical Fantasy Adventure"], "name": "Popful Mail", "overview": "Mail is a young, cute, enthusiastic female bounty-hunting elf. Unfortunately, every time a bounty is a near something goes wrong: the last case was particularly painful, involving Mail bravely cutting off the head of a famous criminal - only to realize that his body escaped without the head. Mail tried at least to sell the head in the nearest town, but discovered that the local tavern was full of these heads stored in a basket. But not all is lost: Mail reads a poster that promises a big reward for someone who catches an evil wizard who terrorizes the land. Sounds like just the job Mail was looking for! This version of Popful Mail is quite different from later releases, even though it has the same story and basic gameplay. However, the layout of locations, regular enemies, bosses, concrete events - everything is entirely different. This version is less of a fast-paced platformer and is more focused on exploration, with more maze-like levels and back-tracking. As in the other versions, there are \"friendly\" areas where Mail can buy weapons, armor, and items. There is no \"attack button\": Mail attacks by simply running into enemies or jumping on them.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "May 22, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Nihon Falcom", "publishers": "Nihon Falcom", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popful_Mail", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133404-popful-mail\n"}
