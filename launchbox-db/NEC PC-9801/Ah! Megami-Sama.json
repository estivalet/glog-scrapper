{"altername_name": ["Aa! Megami-sama!"], "name": "Ah! Megami-Sama", "overview": "Based on the anime series Ah! My Goddess, the game follows the story of a Japanese high-school student named Keiichi, who has accidentally summoned the powerful, yet very lovely Norse goddess Verdandi (mercilessly misspelled Belldandy in the game) and pronounced a wish to stay with her forever. Now the gorgeous goddess has become a part of his life, and the two find themselves involved in constant misunderstandings and comical situations, yet also develop feelings for each other... The game is a typical visual novel. The only gameplay is a periodical decision-making (usually between two options), which might lead to different dialogues and/or scenes; however, most of the time the main story line remains the same.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "March 20, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "nikoli", "publishers": "Banpresto", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/132525-ah-megami-sama\n"}
