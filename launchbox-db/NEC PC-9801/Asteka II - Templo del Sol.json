{"altername_name": ["Taiyou no Shinden: Asteka II"], "name": "Asteka II: Templo del Sol", "overview": "Despite its name (a misspelling of Azteca), the story of Asteka II: Templo del Sol is dedicated to the Maya people, indigenous inhabitants of Southern Mexico and Central America, rather than the Aztecs. The player controls a nameless adventurer who searches for the Sun Key, a mysterious ancient artifact which can unlock the secrets of the Mayan civilization. Asteka II: Templo del Sol is an adventure game which takes place in the ruins of the ancient city Chichen Itza on the Yucatan peninsula in Mexico. There is a top-down overworld on which the player can physically navigate the protagonist, entering temples and other locations. In such locations, the view switches to first-person perspective. The player interacts with the environment by selecting various verb commands (\"Look\", \"Take\", \"Use\", etc.), represented by icons, from a menu, and combining them with objects on the screen. In spite of its Japanese origins, the game features inventory item usage and puzzle-solving, which are more typical of Western-style adventures.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "November 20, 1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Nihon Falcom", "publishers": "Nihon Falcom", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tombs_%26_Treasure", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/Z6yoFZZjN70", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/139639-asteka-ii-templo-del-sol\n"}
