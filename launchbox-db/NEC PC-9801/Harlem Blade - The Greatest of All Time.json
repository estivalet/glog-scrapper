{"altername_name": ["Harlem Blade"], "name": "Harlem Blade: The Greatest of All Time", "overview": "Two thousand years ago, a great hero has defeated the demon lord Gargantua, with the help of a magical sword and a young sorceress. Time has passed, and the sword was inherited by the descendants of the hero. The two last ones are brothers, named Cain and Abel. While Abel has proved himself as a great warrior, Cain prefers to stay in his home village and chase pretty girls. But one day, he has a strange dream. A woman who calls herself the Goddess of Time appears and tells him that Gargantua is about to be revived. Cain first tries to ignore the dream, but soon a series of strange events convinces him that the time has come to prove himself a hero. Harlem Blade is a rather traditional Japanese RPG with top-down navigation (can be done with arrow keys or in a point-and-click fashion with the mouse) and a world-map with linear routes. Enemies appear randomly, with battle screens superimposed on exploration backgrounds. It is possible to speed up the battles by setting them on Auto. Characters level up, buy equipment, use magic and items, and otherwise follow standard Japanese RPG procedures, with the addition of scenes that contain nudity.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Giga", "publishers": "Giga", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133493-harlem-blade-the-greatest-of-all-time\n"}
