{"altername_name": [], "name": "Alice-tachi no Gogo Vol. 1", "overview": "The plot of this game is very simple: there is a big Expo in Japan, and the protagonist - working as a journalist for a company called \"Oh!\" (suspiciously similar to the company that designed this game) - must enter each pavilion and take pictures of the female models there. The trick is that the company is interested in erotic pictures of semi- or completely nude models, so the hero must use all his charm in order to convince the models to do so... Alice-tachi no Gogo can be considered an adventure game with RPG angle. The main challenge of the game is to explore the huge, complex Expo area, finding people and items needed to gain access to new locations. However, there is also an RPG system in the game, even though many typical RPG elements (combat, equipment, etc.) are absent. The hero has a health bar, which is depleted whenever he tries to convince a girl to undress. In a sense, encounters with girls in the pavilions are equivalent to battles in other RPGs: some girls are too \"strong\", and the hero has to level up before he can \"fight\" them. Levels are gained by successfully undressing girls, which corresponds to the cornerstone of RPG gameplay: become stronger through experience.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "December 1, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "New System House Oh!", "publishers": "New System House Oh!", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.88", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147564-alice-tachi-no-gogo-vol-1\n"}
