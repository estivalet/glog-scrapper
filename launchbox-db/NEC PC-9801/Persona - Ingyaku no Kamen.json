{"altername_name": [], "name": "Persona: Ingyaku no Kamen", "overview": "A series of gruesome murders shocks Japan. Young women are kidnapped, tortured, and killed under mysterious circumstances... The protagonist wakes up in what looks like a hospital, but is in fact a special psychiatric facility on a space station. The hero doesn't remember anything, not even his name. Three young women - Shelly, Elisa, and Aoka - will help him to find his memory, and he will gradually realize who he is and what is his mission. Persona: Ingyaku no Kamen can be considered a visual novel, since the only input done by the player throughout the game is a choice which girl to visit. The rest of the game consists of dialogues and cut-scenes (many of which have sexual content). Depending on where the hero goes, and at what moment, the game takes a step towards one of the several endings, most of which are considered \"bad\". To facilitate the player's efforts to reach the best ending, he is given a set of statistics, which will be raised or lowered, indicating how close he is to full success.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "February 9, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sorci\u00e9re", "publishers": "Sorci\u00e9re", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137513-persona-ingyaku-no-kamen\n"}
