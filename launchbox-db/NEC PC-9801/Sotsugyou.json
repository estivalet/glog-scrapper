{"altername_name": ["Graduation", "Sotugyo"], "name": "Sotsugyou", "overview": "Sotsugy\u014d is the first game in the series, released only in Japan. It puts the player into a position of a high school teacher, whose goal is to successfully lead five female students to graduation within the same semester. In order to do that, the player has to study the individual characteristics of the girls. Each girl has different parameters, different strengths and weaknesses. The teacher should be careful not to overload the students with work, but letting them do what they want is not the right way either. The teacher has also control on other aspects of the students' life: it is possible to have personal conversations with the girls to motivate them, and choose leisure activities for them (such as going to the cinema). The girls can become displeased with the teacher or sick, so it's important to keep the morale high in order to achieve successful graduation.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "June 25, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Headroom", "publishers": "Japan Home Video", "genres": "Life Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147854-sotsugyou\n"}
