{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cherry Bomb", "overview": "Sayaka is a female exchange student and supposedly the main love interest of the hero Shoutarou; however, the game's story is hardly dedicated to her; consisting instead of a series of Shoutarou's numerous encounters with young women of different kinds - nurse, police officer, shy neighbor, S&M queen, etc. The gameplay is divided into two modes. The first is Japanese adventure with very simplistic gameplay: in each screen, the player has to press the icons that represent the commands \"Look\", \"Talk\", and \"Move\", several times, to trigger a sex scene and to move to the next location. The second mode are timed arcade-like sequences, which are triggered by the story events and are necessary to complete in order to advance the game. The player has to navigate Shoutarou on a top-down screen, repeatedly pressing a button to unravel an erotic picture hidden beneath. Various enemies (most commonly fire bombs) are trying to collide with Shoutarou. Getting hit results in a loss of a \"life\", after having lost all the lives, the game is over. Power-ups such as additional time, invulnerability, etc., appear on the screen randomly. Each next sequence is typically more difficult than the previous one.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "April 7, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Peppermint Kids", "publishers": "Peppermint Kids", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137095-cherry-bomb\n"}
