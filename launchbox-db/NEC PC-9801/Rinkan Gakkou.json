{"altername_name": [], "name": "Rinkan Gakkou", "overview": "Tomoki Tsugawa is a somewhat effeminate-looking male college student aspiring to become a teacher. One day he meets a former schoolmate who is working as a teacher in a girls high school. He agrees to let Tomoki participate in the school's summer camp, under the condition that he wears woman's clothes and passes as a girl. Rinkan Gakk\u014d plays like a visual novel, having no permanent menu and (with a few exceptions) no other way to interact with the environment but by selecting choices or locations to visit. The choices usually affect the storyline only in a minor way, and there is no possibility to die in the game.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "December 20, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Foster", "publishers": "Foster", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137566-rinkan-gakkou\n"}
