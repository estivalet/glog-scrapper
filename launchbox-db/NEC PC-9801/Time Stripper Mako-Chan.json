{"altername_name": [], "name": "Time Stripper Mako-Chan", "overview": "In Time Stripper, the player controls Shinji Nakayama, a high school student who has a bad reputation of cheating on his girlfriend, Michiyo Sakagami. The story starts when his habit is eventually found out (again) by his girlfriend, after which they start to fight and end up breaking up. In the middle of the hero's sobbing, a girl pops up out of nowhere in the room. It appears she's from the future, with personal reasons that have something to do with Shinji's present love-life situation. After that, the story is in his hands... Like in most visual novels, the gameplay is automatic for the most part; at certain points, the player gets to choose the process on how the story goes. Although most of the time, either choice really makes no difference in the end. The only difference in this game is that if the player makes the wrong choice, some of the more 'interesting' graphical scenes will not be triggered.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "January 26, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Foster", "publishers": "Foster", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137650-time-stripper-mako-chan\n"}
