{"altername_name": [], "name": "Etemible: Tenjou Mukyuu", "overview": "The story of Etemible: Tenj\u014d Muky\u016b is based on Japanese mythology. The goddess Amaterasu hands an ancient sword to a young female warrior named Himiko, and requests her to save Takamagahara, the dwelling of Japanese gods, from the rampage of her chaotic brother Susanoo and his army of demons. Etemible: Tenj\u014d Muky\u016b is a real-time strategy game. Each stage is a large-scale battle, during which the player controls several army units, each led by a \"general\" (Himiko or others). Both enemy and player-controlled units are moving across the map in real time. Whenever two opposing units meet each other, a battle ensues. The player has no control over it - the outcome is decided by the units' parameters, the health of their soldiers, strength and weaknesses, formation strategy the player chose before the battle, etc. The player can choose whether to watch the battle (displayed on a separate screen) or skip it. The interface is window-based, with different windows depicting characters, their parameters, mini-map, and a zoomed-in area of the player's choice.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "January 27, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Glodia", "publishers": "Glodia", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/136571-etemible-tenjou-mukyuu\n"}
