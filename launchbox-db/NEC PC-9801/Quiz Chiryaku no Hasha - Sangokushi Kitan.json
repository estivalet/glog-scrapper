{"altername_name": ["Quiz Chiryaku no Hasya: Sangokushi Kitan"], "name": "Quiz Chiryaku no Hasha: Sangokushi Kitan", "overview": "As the title implies, this is primarily a quiz game; however, it also has elements of strategy. It is possible to play against the computer or compete with another player. The strategy part of the game is set in the Three Kingdoms era. The player chooses one of the famous historical leaders from the time period, and the country he/she plans to invade. Each leader has different statistics (such as \"knowledge\"), which influence the difficulty of the following trivia questions. The timed quiz begins immediately after the choice of a \"war scenario\", depicted as a \"battle of minds\" between famous Three Kingdoms characters. However, the quiz itself is dedicated to Japanese geography, history, and pop culture, having nothing to do with the history of China. On several occasions, the players are also able to choose exactly in which field to compete (Japanese popular music, anime, sports, etc.).", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "December 18, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Capcom", "publishers": "SystemSoft", "genres": "Quiz", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137560-quiz-chiryaku-no-hasha-sangokushi-kitan\n"}
