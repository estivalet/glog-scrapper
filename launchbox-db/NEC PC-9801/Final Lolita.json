{"altername_name": [], "name": "Final Lolita", "overview": "Final Lolita has little to do with PSK's previous similarly-named titles gameplay-wise; however, it shares with them the macabre premise of sex with underage girls, and is the most explicit and violent of the three. The game's genre is closest to RPG format, since it focuses on a character's attributes and allows the player to increase them. These attributes are Power, Arm Level, Defence, and Technique, each playing a role in upcoming battles. The player can choose to distribute a hundred points among these parameters in the beginning of the game. Navigation takes place on a top-down map, the player character represented as a simple square. Many spots on the map contain various objects, which will increase or decrease the protagonist's attributes. The goal is to power up the character sufficiently for combat. Battles occur when the player navigates the main character to a spot occupied by a girl and chooses to attack her. Each girl has her own statistics and the outcome of the battle is decided after several rounds. Afterwards, the player has the choice of letting the girl go. The other two options are raping or physically torturing the girl.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "November 1, 1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "PSK", "publishers": "PSK", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/153665-final-lolita\n"}
