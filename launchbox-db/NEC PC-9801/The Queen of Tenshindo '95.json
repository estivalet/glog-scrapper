{"altername_name": ["Yan Yan no Gekitou Dousoukai"], "name": "The Queen of Tenshindo '95", "overview": "Queen of Tenshindo '95 is a hentai (adult) card game that plays almost the same way as the one known as \u201cUno\u201d. Each player is dealt seven cards, and the objective is to be the first who discards all in hand. You do so by matching cards either by colour or number with the card shown in the discard pile (and thus the card thrown is the next to be matched). There are also cards with special \u201cpowers\u201d that skip other players, change direction or force other players to draw additional cards, adding a somewhat strategical element. In the game you play against other four players (anime girls), and when winning you are presented with an interactive hentai scene. Each game consists of three rounds, the winner being the one who has more points (as the winner gets points based in the cards that opponents have in hand).", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "March 27, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tenshindo", "publishers": "Tenshindo", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147818-the-queen-of-tenshindo-95\n"}
