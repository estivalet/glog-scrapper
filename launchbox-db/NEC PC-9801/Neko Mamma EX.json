{"altername_name": [], "name": "Neko Mamma EX", "overview": "Neko Mamma EX is a collection of four small games, unrelated by genre, story, or theme - with the exception of omnipresent adult content: The longest of the games is a very simple dungeon crawler; the protagonist explores a pseudo-3D maze, fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat and gradually leveling up. The enemies are pretty young women who undress upon defeat. A so-called \"Battle Quiz\" is a striptease trivia game in which the player must answer a series of questions within a time limit. After each successful round the virtual female opponent removes a part of her clothes. In the \"Cat Race\" game the player gambles, betting on various feline-themed attractive women who take part in a running competition. The player can choose between four different courses. A very short Japanese-style adventure game with minimal interface, in which a young girl consults a psychologist and receives a somewhat unusual treatment. In addition, Neko Mamma EX features a music room, \"making of\" information, and an art gallery with mostly unrelated, often erotically-themed images.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "May 21, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Four Nine", "publishers": "Four Nine", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/142085-neko-mamma-ex\n"}
