{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mahou Shoujo Rina", "overview": "The second Magical Story Series game is not connected to the predecessor story-wise, but has a similar premise. The heroine this time is a little girl named Rina, who has a crush on an older boy, whose name is Tatsuya. One night she sees a falling star and wishes to be a grown-up young woman. Miraculously, her wish is fulfilled; but the falling star is revealed to contain a mischievous imp, who grants Rina an ability to grow up and return to her normal self, as well as assume the appearance of other people... Like the first game, Rina plays like a typical Japanese adventure, with a \"Look-Talk-Think-Move\" command menu, no puzzles, and the standard requirement to \"trigger\" new commands by going through all the available ones, often more than one time. Unlike Kumi, Rina cannot qualify as an adult game. There are implicit erotic situations and innuendo, but no explicit nudity or scenes with sexual content.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "August 6, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Family Soft", "publishers": "Family Soft", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/140889-mahou-shoujo-rina\n"}
