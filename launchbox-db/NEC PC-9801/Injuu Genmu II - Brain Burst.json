{"altername_name": ["Injiu Genmu 2: Brain Burst"], "name": "Injuu Genmu II: Brain Burst", "overview": "There is no real story in Inj\u016b Genmu II: Brain Burst!!; the setting is a certain magical land where three young, pretty, female magical creatures hold a contest. Innocent young girls will test the knowledge of the participant, and should he win, he will be treated to... a blood-chilling spectacle of said girl being raped by a tentacle monster. Unlike the first game, this is a quiz simulation. The player can choose a topic at the beginning of the game (general education, entertainment, etc.). The match against each girl consists of three round, each round containing ten questions. There are only two answers to choose from each time, but the player is given a deadline for choosing the wrong one.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "April 28, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ringer Bell", "publishers": "Ringer Bell", "genres": "Quiz", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137325-injuu-genmu-ii-brain-burst\n"}
