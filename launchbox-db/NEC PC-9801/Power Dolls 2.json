{"altername_name": [], "name": "Power Dolls 2", "overview": "Power Dolls 2 is a turn-based mecha-themed tactical game set in a futuristic scenario of the 26th century. Like its predecessor, the game focuses on the war between the planets Omni and Earth. The player commands the all-female Detachment Of Limited Line Service (\"Dolls\") squad and can opt for going through the campaign in a linear fashion or directly select specific missions from the main menu. The gameplay is very similar to that of the previous game, with some interface-related and customization additions (such as more detailed ways to outfit mechas). The player must build a team out of several available pilots, assigning a mecha or another type of craft (plane, mobile rocket-launcher, etc.) depending on the type of mission and its requirements. The player then proceeds to the actual mission, navigating squad members in turn-based fashion through a top-down area. Like in the first game, tactical considerations (pre-mission choices, positioning of team members, etc.) sometimes carry more weight than actual armed confrontations with the enemy.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "December 2, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kogado Studio", "publishers": "Kogado Studio", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133406-power-dolls-2\n"}
