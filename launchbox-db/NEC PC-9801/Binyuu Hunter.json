The majority of human beings were born in space since then. But their health was much worse than the health of average human being born on the Earth before. Scientists have developed a unique technology on the second oldest space colony, named T2. But something went terribly wrong, and soon the scientists realized that they were killing human beings with the new technology. The project leader was killed, and a man named Nakajima took the power into his own hands, intending to continue the experiment for his own destructive purposes. One of the scientists contacted then a young female hunter, a special agent trained in armed combat, to help him track down the bad guys and to stop the experiment.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "July 28, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "T2", "publishers": "T2", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106063-binyuu-hunter\n"}
