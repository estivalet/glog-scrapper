{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gakuen Toshi Z", "overview": "In the future, the Earth became so over-populated that the governments started building space stations, to which people would be later transferred. Those space stations were protected by giant robots powered by special crystals. Academy Z specialized in educating its students in everything concerning those robots. Two teams - Red and White - are competing to gather crystals for the robots, and learning to navigate them to become future protectors of humanity. Aya is a young girl who just joined the Red Team - first training in safe areas, but hoping to become a real robot pilot later. The game plays mostly like a first-person dungeon crawler. The player navigates Aya's robot through pseudo-3D maze-like environments. Hostile robots appear randomly. The combat system is rather simple, with standard Japanese RPG-style options (\"Attack\", \"Flee\", \"Use Item\", etc.). Experience points are gained to level up and become stronger. There are also adventure elements in the game: at any time, pressing the Space key will bring a typical Japanese-style adventure interaction menu with options such as \"Look\", \"Talk\", etc. Movement outside of hostile areas is also done through menu commands.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Striker", "publishers": "Striker", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137216-gakuen-toshi-z\n"}
