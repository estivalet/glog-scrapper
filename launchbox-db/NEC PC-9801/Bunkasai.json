{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bunkasai", "overview": "Bunkasai puts the player in the role of a male Japanese high-school student. One day his teacher tells him about the upcoming culture festival, giving him the assignment to help his lovely classmate Mia in the preparations. Naturally, the young man's mind is more directed towards... err... other aspects of Mia's personality. But what starts as a simple collaboration between high-school students soon turns into a drama full of violence and difficult decisions to make... The game is a Japanese-style adventure with reduced command menu and interaction. At every given screen, there are a few commands (mostly just two), sometimes the standard Look and Talk, sometimes context-based actions. Usually the story advances automatically when the player has gone through all the commands several times. The game has nudity and explicit sex scenes.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "June 14, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "UCom", "publishers": "UCom", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137078-bunkasai\n"}
