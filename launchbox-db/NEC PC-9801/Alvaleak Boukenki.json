{"altername_name": ["Alvaleak B\u014dkenki"], "name": "Alvaleak Boukenki", "overview": "The land of Alvaleak is home to many explorers and adventures who hunt for rare treasures. Three such adventurers descended once into a mysterious cave - and no one has ever heard from them afterwards. Their children grew up and became adventurers themselves, members of the adventurers' guild: the boy Riva and the girl Emily. One day they are entrusted with a dangerous assignment: explore the so-called \"diamond cave\", grab the treasures, and report to the superiors. The young heroes do not now that this is just the beginning of a grand journey, during which they will discover the truth about what happened to their fathers... Made by the creators of Emerald Dragon, Alvaleak Boukenki is a Japanese-style RPG that plays almost entirely from first-person perspective (except short and linear transitions on the top-down map). All the locations (including towns) are displayed as dungeon-like areas. In dangerous locations (caves, towers, etc.), enemies appear randomly. The turn-based battles can be set on auto. The player-controlled party of characters (up to four) uses guns as their weapons; bullets must also be bought from weapon shops. There are no magic spells in the game. All the areas are auto-mapped as the player explores them.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "November 5, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Glodia", "publishers": "Glodia", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/131925-alvaleak-boukenki\n"}
