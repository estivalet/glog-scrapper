{"altername_name": [], "name": "Revival Xanadu", "overview": "Revival Xanadu is a remake of Xanadu: Dragon Slayer II. The remake distinguishes itself with the more detailed, graphically more advanced character portraits and backgrounds in the various places of interest (inns, temples, shops, etc.). Player and enemy sprites are also drawn in a noticeably more detailed way and have a higher resolution. However, the side-scrolling exploration environments retain the original look, with \"retro\" graphics reminiscent of the older original game. For the most part, the location layout in this remake are the same as in the original version, and the gameplay remains largely unchanged as well.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "April 28, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Nihon Falcom", "publishers": "Nihon Falcom", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133474-revival-xanadu\n"}
