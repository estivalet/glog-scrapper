Hero does not want publicity and wants to hire a private detective. But on his way there he attends a birthday party of one of team members and discovers the cup in one of the rooms... Mentioning anything else of the plot would be a spoiler. Enough to say that there is a happy end. This episode is \"final\" instead of a number meaning it's more of an extra episode after the whole baseball business. Episode is the longest and does not have a game included making it a nice final.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "July 20, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Great", "publishers": "Great", "genres": "Visual Novel", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/142439-doki-doki-pretty-league-final\n"}
