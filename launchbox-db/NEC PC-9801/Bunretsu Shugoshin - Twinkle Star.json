{"altername_name": ["Bunretsu Shiyugo Shin Twinkle Star"], "name": "Bunretsu Shugoshin: Twinkle Star", "overview": "The hero of the game, a high-school student named Touma, has a strange dream, in which he is a hero, a savior of the world in a parallel dimension. And now he is dying, having sacrificed his life for a beautiful woman whom he calls Ruby. Touma wakes up, unable to understand anything, and suddenly realizes it was not a dream... at least not entirely. A magical symbol is engraved on his forehead. Touma realizes that he will have to learn more about his heroic destiny. Meanwhile, a young, seductive English teacher arrives at his school... Twinkle Star can be considered a visual novel, most of the player's input being reduced to selection of dialogues, context-dependent actions, and hero's own thoughts. During sex scenes, however, the game switched to point-and-click interface with command icons.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "July 29, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Studio Twinkle", "publishers": "Studio Twinkle", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133264-bunretsu-shugoshin-twinkle-star\n"}
