{"altername_name": ["Twilight Zone: Dreamy Alien Girls", "Twilight Zone Vol. 4: Tokubetsu-hen: Dreamy Alien Girls"], "name": "Twilight Zone Vol. 4: Tokubetsu-hen", "overview": "Aliens have invaded Earth. Seemingly impervious to damage, they took control of the planet. Only a few partisan organizations dared to oppose their rule. All the aliens look like young and attractive human women, and soon it was found out that they have a weakness to sperm. Thus, a young Japanese man and his few male allies embark on a quest to defeat the aliens by having sex with them. The fourth installment of the Twilight Zone series is not connected to its predecessors story-wise. Like the three previous games, it is an RPG where the enemies are exclusively semi-naked girls and most battle commands correspond to sexual actions. Unlike the preceding games, navigation is done in top-down view, though the battles remain first-person. Up to three characters will join the protagonist and take part in combat. There is no world map and the game is built in a fairly linear way, with only a few friendly areas where enemies do not appear.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Great", "publishers": "Great", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133052-twilight-zone-vol-4-tokubetsu-hen\n"}
