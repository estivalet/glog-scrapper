{"altername_name": [], "name": "Erotic Baka Novel Series 2: Itsuka Dokoka de.", "overview": "The follower-up to the first Erotic Baka Novel game is similar to it in structure: it is a visual novel with multiple story lines, which take place according to the decisions made by the player during the game. The protagonist is once again a regular Japanese male; this time, the initial \"trigger event\" is a message on his pager. Three different choices regarding his reaction to the beeper's sound lead to three very different story arcs, each involving its own sub-branches. Compared to the first game, Itsuka Dokoka de offers significantly less choices, and they occur more seldom. The \"choice-consequence\" mechanism is therefore simpler and more transparent in this sequel. The variety of events from the first game is also reduced, the second game focusing more exclusively on encounters of a sexual nature with various women.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "April 28, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Cocktail Soft", "publishers": "Cocktail Soft", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "0.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137168-erotic-baka-novel-series-2-itsuka-dokoka-de\n"}
