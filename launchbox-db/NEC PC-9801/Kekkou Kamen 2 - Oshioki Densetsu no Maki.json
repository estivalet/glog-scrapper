{"altername_name": ["Kekkou Kamen 2", "Kekk\u014d Kamen 2: O-Shioki Densetsu no Maki"], "name": "Kekkou Kamen 2: Oshioki Densetsu no Maki", "overview": "In the sequel to to the first Kekk\u014d Kamen, the player is no longer required to control the satanic protagonist of the previous game. Instead, the protagonist is a young substitute teacher (default name Ryusuke) who is perplexed at his discoveries in the high school he is invited to work for. As the title implies (shioki means \"corporal punishment\"), some teachers and students engage in bizarre sadistic activities. It's up to the player to decide how the new guy will fit in. This sequel plays more like a traditional Japanese first-person adventure, with still screens, plenty of text, and a basic verb-object interface (\"Look\", \"Think\", \"Move\", etc.). Unlike the first game, the protagonist is not inherently evil here. It is possible to make choices and decide whether he should save the victims or join the torturers. The game keeps track of the hero's alignment, from \"demonic\" to \"angelic\" and anything in between.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "June 15, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Dynamic Production", "publishers": "Dynamic Production", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133422-kekkou-kamen-2-oshioki-densetsu-no-maki\n"}
