{"altername_name": [], "name": "Escalation '95", "overview": "Escalation '95 doesn't have a particularly elaborate story: the protagonist is a female student named Naomi, who attends the Catholic St. Azarea high school. At the beginning of the year, new students enter the school, and Naomi's task is to show them around and help them - which she does in a very particular fashion... The game consists mainly of pornographic scenes; everything else is reduces to the minimum. Only five characters (beside Naomi) appear in the game, all of them new female students. There is menu-based navigation on the school map, but outside of the sex scenes, there is no other kind of interaction. During the sex scenes, however, a wide variety of actions is available. Naomi's partners have a special \"pleasure meter\"; the goal is to fill it by gradually performing the actions the girl approves of, which effectively turns the game into a simulation of sex. Despite this pleasure meter, most of the scenes include rather irregular sexual activities and torture.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "March 4, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Fairy Dust", "publishers": "Fairy Dust", "genres": "Visual Novel", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/140948-escalation-95\n"}
