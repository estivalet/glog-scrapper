{"altername_name": [], "name": "Celery", "overview": "Celery is an arcade action game. In 1989 the inhabitants of the great underground city of Kanazawa had to defend themselves against an unusual peril: a tornado that took away the clothes of high school girls. The game consists of one-screen stages. The player controls a pad similar to those found in Pong games, moving it right and left (with limited up and down mobility) on the screen. Various objects keep falling down; some are beneficial (mushrooms enlarge the pad, coins increase score, clocks lengthen the time limit, etc.), while others (rocks, stop signs, etc.) are harmful, leading to a loss of a life and eventually to Game Over if the player-controlled pad touches them. Other objects include speed-ups and exit signs, which automatically take the player to the next level. This, however, is hardly the goal, as the stages have to be completed the ordinary way, withstanding the onslaught of the objects for a sufficient amount of time. The bonus rewards are then calculated, and the player is shown a full-screen, full-color picture of the girl. Among the falling objects are also clothes items of the girl whose picture is shown in the background during gameplay; accumulating a sufficient amount of those leads to a nude picture of the girl.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "July 7, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Software House Parsley", "publishers": "Software House Parsley", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/153938-celery\n"}
