{"altername_name": [], "name": "School Girls", "overview": "School Girls tells the story of Shinsuke, a young man looking for a teaching job. His uncle is the principal of a prestigious girls' high school, and he assigns to his nephew the job of a substitute art teacher. The rest of the plot is mostly dedicated to Shinsuke's relationships (sexual and otherwise) with the various female students and co-workers. The game allows no interaction besides choosing a location in the school to visit (office, gym, main gate, etc.). Going to specific locations triggers scenes that eventually advance the story. At certain points the player will also be prompted to make a choice regarding a context-specific action. Many of these choices, however, are purely cosmetic and do not affect the plot.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "April 14, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "ScooP", "publishers": "ScooP", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147836-school-girls\n"}
