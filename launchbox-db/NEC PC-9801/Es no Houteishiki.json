{"altername_name": ["Es no H\u014dteishiki"], "name": "Es no Houteishiki", "overview": "Es no H\u014dteishiki is the second game in the Detective Suzusaki series. The events described in the previous game, The Literary Fragment, led to a series of suicides, but the case was believed to be closed. But Kusanagi, the young brilliant psychologist and assistant of the famous detective Suzusaki, has now to face his own past. The traces lead to a remote village, which has seen nine mysterious, unsolved murders in eleven years. Soon, Kusanagi discovers a strange religious cult, that might shed some light on his past... Though the game focuses more on Kusanagi, it also features Suzusaki as the playable character during some scenes. The gameplay is similar to that of its predecessor, with point-and-click interface. The player clicks on various objects on the screen to read descriptions, conduct conversations, and advance the story. There are no puzzles in the game. The interaction is more reduced as opposes to the previous game, though there are still some moments when the player is able to make a decision that will have an effect on the next scenes.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "May 24, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Abogado Powers", "publishers": "Abogado Powers", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/139234-es-no-houteishiki\n"}
