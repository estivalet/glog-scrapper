{"altername_name": ["Panic in Cobra City: Cobra Mission", "Cobra Mission: Panic in Cobra City"], "name": "Cobra Mission", "overview": "The hero of the game is a Japanese private investigator named Satoru, who has opened a detective agency in the fictional Cobra City, working together with his lovely partner Midori. A powerful man contacts Midori and asks to investigate a matter concerning his business; at the same time, Satoru is preoccupied with cases of kidnapping, the victims always being young and pretty girls... This is the original release that served as a prototype for the better-known title of the same name, which was developed by a different company and has major differences in gameplay, location design, and story. In this version, the main gameplay mechanics also involve exploring the top-down Cobra City, fighting random enemies from first-person view, gaining experience, leveling up, buying weapons and equipment, etc. However, the battles are strictly turn-based, having no action element whatsoever. Items cannot be found on the overhead map. Locations emphasize a Japanese setting, and many story sequences present in the later version are either absent or different.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "October 25, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "INOS", "publishers": "INOS", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobra_Mission:_Panic_in_Cobra_City", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/134289-cobra-mission\n"}
