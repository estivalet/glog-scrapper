{"altername_name": ["Maskarade"], "name": "The Masquerade", "overview": "Kyosuke, an ordinary Japanese teenager, receives one day a strange invitation to a foreign mansion apparently belonging to a mysterious rich woman. Disregarding the bizarre occurrences accompanying his first impression, Kyosuke agrees to venture into each of the four rooms with colored doors inside the mansion. Each door leads him to a different reality, where he is manifested in different incarnations that allow him to experience various kinds of sexual encounters. The Masquerade is essentially a visual novel, though with a larger amount of available actions and choices than usually occur in games of this type. One of the stories Kyosuke can access has more pronounced adventure gameplay, with limited menu-based navigation. The others mostly unfold according to choices made by the player. These choices may trigger different scenes or lead to \"bad\" endings.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "November 25, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Janis", "publishers": "Janis", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137456-the-masquerade\n"}
