{"altername_name": [], "name": "Kigen: Kagayaki no Hasha", "overview": "Shizuni is a planet in the solar system of the star Vanas. The planet emits a glowing light. The humans have built a civilization there, similar to medieval Europe of our Earth. Whenever forces of darkness threaten the planet, it releases three shining orbs. These orbs choose their heroes, who would then join forces and defeat the evil. This time around, one of such heroes is Kanan, a young knight who has swore to serve his king. He must find the other heroes and save the planet, before it is once again controlled by the dark forces. Kigen: Kagayaki no Hasha is a traditional Japanese RPG with top-down world, randomly appearing enemies, simple leveling up system, etc. The battles are turn-based, with a slight twist: the game doesn't pause when the player selects battles commands, similarly to Final Fantasy games. The battles are set on auto, but it is possible to input precise commands at any time. The characters utilize physical attacks and techniques, which require technique points (TP).", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "December 12, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Riverhill Soft", "publishers": "Riverhill Soft", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/0cIdl53c3lI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/134166-kigen-kagayaki-no-hasha\n"}
