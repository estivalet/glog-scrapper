{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sakusaku Daigoutou Returns", "overview": "The playable character in this game is a blacksmith called Bargon. As he introduces himself in the beginning of the game, he explains that he enjoys killing people. And that's exactly what the player will have to do while controlling this character. Bargon enters a small village, where he is able to kill anyone, including little children. If the \"attack\" key is pressed when Bargon is near a young woman, he rapes her instead of killing. Most of the people he kills can't defend themselves and are completely powerless while he is slaughtering them. Killing (or raping) certain characters triggers events, opening new locations. Eventually, Bargon will have to fight armed warriors and other powerful characters who come to stop him. The game uses a single attack key for all the actions; items are collected automatically when Bargon bumps into their containers. It is possible to use healing items as well as teleport to the entrance of a location.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "November 6, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "A-Inn", "publishers": "Exst", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "0.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/140941-sakusaku-daigoutou-returns\n"}
