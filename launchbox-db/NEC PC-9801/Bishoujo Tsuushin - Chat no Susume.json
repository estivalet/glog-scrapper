{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bishoujo Tsuushin: Chat no Susume", "overview": "Interactive chat with girls from previous Cocktail Soft games. This is the first attempt to make an interactive chat and it's indeed a crude one. You can't even choose phrases, just icons that are meant to represent some emotion. The girls talks is also robotic-like - it's not interactive at all. Game should be treated just as a fan disk to meet favorite characters again.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "July 6, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Cocktail Soft", "publishers": "Cocktail Soft", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/139877-bishoujo-tsuushin-chat-no-susume\n"}
