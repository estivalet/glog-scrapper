{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hatsukoi Monogatari", "overview": "An ordinary Japanese student finds a floppy disk on the street; using his computer to load data from it, he miraculously summons Foltjunia, an intergalactic warrior who fights evil in her robotic armor with three companions. However, Foltjunia has lost her powers and as a result stays with the hero, giving him advice as to how to conquer the love of a schoolmate. Following a brief prologue with adventure-like gameplay, the bulk of Hatsukoi Monogatari consists of managerial simulation along the lines of Princess Maker games, though with more limited options and no RPG elements. The player manages the hero's daily schedule, divided into two segments: school and home. Activities include studying, having conversations with students or teachers, taking part-time jobs, resting, talking on the phone, shopping, buying presents, etc. Each activity increases or decreases some of the hero's parameters. The overall level can be evaluated on a special screen, and the goal is to raise it by balancing the stats with various activities.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "March 5, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Game Technopolis", "publishers": "Game Technopolis", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137286-hatsukoi-monogatari\n"}
