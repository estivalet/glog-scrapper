{"altername_name": [], "name": "Idaten Ikase Otoko 3: Sengo-hen", "overview": "Japan is occupied after the end of the World War II. Hero is a soldier who does not speak Japanese, but has an ability to excite girls with random phrases alone. This time the phrases are refined even further and the game is made less painful to progress with gauge filling much faster. At the same time the pictures of afterwar chaos mixed with a lot of satire give the game a more playful feel. Despite all the improvements I just can't appreciate a game that's based on inputting digits to make random phrases of them.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "February 28, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Family Soft", "publishers": "Family Soft", "genres": "Visual Novel", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/142046-idaten-ikase-otoko-3-sengo-hen\n"}
