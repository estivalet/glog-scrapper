{"altername_name": ["Dragon City"], "name": "Dragon City X Shitei", "overview": "One day hero is taken to a different world. And in this world women are taught to respond to desires of men. Fairytale X-Shitei is actually the main company name of 1991. It's the first division to produce only specialized H works without much plot, but with top level of drawing. And since there was no regulation yet, it was produced without any censorship. And eventually by the end of the year it led to an arrest of company director for indecency and introduction on censorship in computer games. This game is on par to the overall flow - cute and indecent.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "February 28, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Fairytale X-Shitei", "publishers": "Kirara", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133165-dragon-city-x-shitei\n"}
