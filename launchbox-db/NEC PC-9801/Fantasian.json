{"altername_name": [], "name": "Fantasian", "overview": "The magical country of Luizard has been recently terrorized by the minions of the demon king Billades. The king of the country recruits a party of brave warriors, asking them to do the impossible: venture into the depths of Billades' lair, defeat the demon king, and release the Elven Seed that would restore the country to its glory. Fantasian is a role-playing game that mostly relies on the Wizardry template. The player creates characters (up to five in the active party), choosing between traditional fantasy races (elf, half-orc, etc.) and classes. The latter are divided into four disciplines (thief, fighter, monk, and magician), each containing two classes, of which the less powerful one may evolve into a stronger form by meeting certain conditions during gameplay. The player then takes these characters to explore an abstract maze, fighting randomly appearing enemies. Combat takes place on a top-down screen and is similar in concept to that of Ultima games.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Xtalsoft", "publishers": "XTALSOFT", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137193-fantasian\n"}
