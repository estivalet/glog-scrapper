{"altername_name": [], "name": "Coin", "overview": "The hero of this game (default name Ryouta) is a typical hentai protagonist: a male teenager who is interested only in sex. One day, Ryouta finds a cute black bunny and brings it home; the next morning, the bunny turns into a sexy black-haired girl! Needless to say the activities the two perform during the course of the game do not include playing chess or discussing philosophy. But Ryouta is not satisfied with the \"bunny girl\" alone, what with all those cute female schoolmates around him... Coin is a visual novel with an emphasis on decision-making. Choices that the player has to make periodically lead to different scenes. Many of the choices (for example, raping a girl) are considered \"wrong\" and lead to a premature ending of the game.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "August 30, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Ange", "publishers": "Ange", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137101-coin\n"}
