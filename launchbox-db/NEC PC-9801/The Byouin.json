{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Byouin", "overview": "Patients begin to die one by one under mysterious circumstances in a mental hospital. A young nurse named Ikuko Matsuda doubts that these deaths were natural. On day, Ikuko disappears, leaving behind a blood-stained cash card. Her fiance Katsuyoshi Yamazaki ventures into the hospital, attempting to investigate the mystery. The By\u014din (\"The Hospital\") is an adventure game mostly consisting of text, with a few black-white anime-style drawings or digitized photos for certain locations and events. It is, however, not a text adventure, since there is no text input. The player selects commands appearing on the menu to the left of the main text body. These commands mostly include detailed examination options. Much of the challenge in the gameplay comes from amassing a large inventory mainly consisting of documents of various types which serve as investigation clues. There are also commands that may lead to Game Over in certain situations. The game contains adult themes and a few images with nudity.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "December 1, 1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "PSK", "publishers": "PSK", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/153662-the-byouin\n"}
