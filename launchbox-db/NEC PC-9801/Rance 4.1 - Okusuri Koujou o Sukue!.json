{"altername_name": [], "name": "Rance 4.1: Okusuri Koujou o Sukue!", "overview": "This is a side-story in Rance series, released shortly after the fourth game, but dedicated to an entirely different quest. All kinds of troubles are happening to a factory where a new Happiness Medicine is being developed. The mercenary Rance is hired by the manager to investigate the source of these troubles. First task: clear the factory of the monsters... This is a role-playing game with turn-based combat and strong adventure elements (menu with command verbs such as \"examine\", \"talk\", etc., at every given screen). Unlike previous Rance games, battles do not allow free movement on the screen and are carried out in a more traditional Japanese-style way. There is no physical movement in the game; hostile areas (dungeons) are also explored by choosing menu commands. As in all other Rance games, there are explicit sex scenes in this game.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "December 1, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Alice Soft", "publishers": "Alice Soft", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137543-rance-41-okusuri-koujou-o-sukue\n"}
