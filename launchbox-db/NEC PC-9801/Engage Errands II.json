{"altername_name": [], "name": "Engage Errands II", "overview": "Five hundred years have passed since the twelve Angelic Disciples defeated the evil sorceress Guendola. All that remained was her book of curses, for which nobody found any use. Peace descended upon the humans. But the young princess Ashura Kei showed Guendola's book to the angel Dominion; after having read the book, Dominion realized that she could attain the power of Guendola, betrayed the humans, and placed a rather embarrassing curse on Ashura's general, Leon: he was endowed with a pair of breasts... But with such \"disguise\", Leon found it easier to \"train\" the best female fighters in the country and assemble an army that would defeat evil once again. Hikari o Ninau Mono plays similarly to its predecessor; it is a rather simple turn-based strategy/RPG hybrid. As in the first game, the player commands a squad of pretty girls, each with her own movement and attack range. Battle sequences are now fully animated, showing unique attack moves for all characters. There is still no exploration outside of battles, but the player has more options beside equipping his fighters: as Leon, it is possible to spend an evening with a girl of the player's choice in different locations, which might lead to further erotic scenes.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "February 10, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Ponytail Soft", "publishers": "Ponytail Soft", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137166-engage-errands-ii\n"}
