{"altername_name": ["Deja Vu 2", "D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu II: Lost in Las Vegas"], "name": "DE\u30fbJA II", "overview": "DE\u30fbJA 2 starts where the previous game ended. The young researcher and archaeologist Ryuusuke Hatsushiba has solved the mystery of the ancient jewels, became a hero, and conquered the heart of the pretty Gachako. The Japanese Archaeological Society has chosen a new president instead of the old man Hyuga. But it's not the end of Ryuusuke's adventures. Suspicious circumstances surrounding the change of the president, new mysterious artifacts brought by clients, troubles concerning Gachako's friends, and (most importantly) more pretty ladies to haunt Ryuusuke's imagination - everything makes him forget his articles and his collections... Like its predecessor, DE\u30fbJA 2 is a Japanese-style adventure. The interface has been enhanced compared to the first game. Most of the commands are still done via the extensive verb menus and object sub-menus; once again, it is usually necessary to use those commands several times in order to gain new information and thus advance the story. However, in certain places, icon-based interface becomes available, with point-and-click interaction. The icons include traditional talking, touching, as well as less common commands such as hitting, and even an icon depicting a condom, for... err... scientific activities that are closer to anatomy than archeology.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "June 25, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Elf", "publishers": "elf", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137116-deja-ii\n"}
