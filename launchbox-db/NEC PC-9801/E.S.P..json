{"altername_name": [], "name": "E.S.P.", "overview": "E.S.P. is a side-scrolling shooter. There is no plot in the game - the player controls a robot-like flying device, shooting his way through hordes of organic and mechanical enemies. The player-controlled device can be moved in four directions, and also adjust the angle of fire. There is only one kind of power-up in the game (a floating letter P); eating it will expand the range of the device's fire and also grant it an additional weapon (shooting blue spheres); the player can then adjust the fire angle in such a way that the device can shoot in different directions with different weapons. Each stage features two or three mini-bosses and a final boss. Fighting the bosses usually requires memorizing their fire patterns, avoiding their attacks and firing when there is an opening. There is no health bar in the game; the player is sent back to the beginning of the stage whenever his device touches an enemy or is hit by enemy fire. There are unlimited continues. Instead of cut-scenes, usually advancing the plot in this type of games, the player is shown a completely unrelated erotic picture of a young girl after the end of each level.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "A-Inn", "publishers": "A-Inn", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/125627-esp\n"}
