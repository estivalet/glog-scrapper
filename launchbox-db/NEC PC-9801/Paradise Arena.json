{"altername_name": ["Gokuraku Arena"], "name": "Paradise Arena", "overview": "A man named Shinichi encounters a mysterious young girl who tells him that she and her friends developed new technology that allows unprecedented immersion in virtual worlds. Shinichi is then chosen to be the test subject of the new virtual reality device, participating in adventures where his sexual powers are tested above all. Paradise Arena consists of four independent \"virtual reality\" scenarios, each dedicated to a particular theme as the protagonists visits a harem, enters an agency that promotes pop singers, is hired as a tutor, and travels to an airport. Each scenario consists almost entirely of seduction scenes that eventually lead to explicit sex scenes. The game plays similarly to visual novels, albeit with several choices during every scene. Rather than making one decision, the player has to repeatedly select options and check how they influence a counter that reports the woman's mood. When this counter reaches zero the game is over.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "June 24, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Janis", "publishers": "Janis", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137510-paradise-arena\n"}
