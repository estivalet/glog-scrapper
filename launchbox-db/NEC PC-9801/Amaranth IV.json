{"altername_name": [], "name": "Amaranth IV", "overview": "Amaranth IV continues the over-arching story of the series. The main heroine in this game is not Liann Fremdes, the usual protagonist of Amaranth games, but his lovely elf companion Din. After visiting the ancient city of Posse and meeting some new friends, Din heads to the capital city of Stellar to meet prince Deinass, whom she helped eight years ago during events described in the previous game. But shadows from the past keep haunting the young prince. His sister is kidnapped by an old acquaintance. Din, Deinass, and their friends must do everything they can to bring her back and to stop a new threat to the kingdom. Similarly to the previous game, Amaranth IV contains elements of strategy RPGs: limited exploration, rare and story-dictated battles, and turn-based combat with free movement on the battle field. However, it gets rid of the \"vigour\" and action points system of the previous game, in favor of simpler gameplay. The player-controlled characters act in turns, and can usually move and execute a physical attack (or cast a spell) one time per turn. Some weapons require specific placement on the field (for example, bows require a character equipped with them to stand diagonally across the enemy in order to be able to attack). Character receive experience points and level up after defeating enemies; fallen character are resurrected to full health after battles. Instead of the usual top-down view, Amaranth IV uses isometric perspective for battles and exploration.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "August 4, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Fuga System", "publishers": "Fuga System", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/123364-amaranth-iv\n"}
