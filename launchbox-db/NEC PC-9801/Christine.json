{"altername_name": [], "name": "Christine", "overview": "A young girl was enjoying a happy life with her boyfriend when suddenly, out of nowhere, a powerful spell was cast and the poor boy was turned into stone. A sorceress named Christine appears and says that another sorceress called Jane was the culprit. The young heroine must find a way to defeat Jane and revert her boyfriend to normal. Christine is a Japanese-style adventure taking place in a fantasy world. Screen-by-screen navigation is done with arrow keys. Every screen offers a few commands, mostly allowing to talk to the character present or sometimes perform other actions (such as have sex or attack). There is no inventory, but the player has to complete certain task and acquire specific items to be able to defeat Jane. It is also possible to attempt this at an earlier moment, but the result in that case is Game Over. With the exception of her boyfriend, all the characters in the game are female. The game features scenes with explicit sexual situations as well as torture and violence.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "October 1, 1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "PSK", "publishers": "PSK", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/153663-christine\n"}
