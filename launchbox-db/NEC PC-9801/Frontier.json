The goddess there gives a test to make love to three her maids. 3. \"Blood line\" is about a an adult store owner Eleanor who supplies space ships with sex dolls. She learns about a suspicious disappearance of a space ship that is rumored to be hijacked by a terrorist group. It's a multi-site adventure that shows another point of view after initial playthrough. Stories are set in some desolate future and quite elaborately done. It might be the peak of multiple stories genre, but whatever complicated prelude is, it inevitably leads to multiple H events.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "August 25, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Frontier", "publishers": "Discovery", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/132668-frontier\n"}
