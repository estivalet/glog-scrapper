{"altername_name": [], "name": "Oh! Kitsune-sama", "overview": "The protagonist of the game is a young boy who is about to graduate high school and is looking for a job to support himself during the upcoming college years. However, fate intervened and arranged a bike accident, which resulted in a meeting with a creature from another world - a cute fox-girl named Sharan. She needs nothing else but to be together with the hero; but a mysterious voice tells him: \"one wish has been fulfilled, two more to go\"... Oh! Kitsune-sama can be considered a visual novel. Though there are instances with the typical \"Look/Talk/Think\" interaction, it is very limited, there are no sub-menus with objects, every choice is context-related, and the game can be advanced simply by going through all the choices. There are scenes with explicit sexual situations in the game.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "May 31, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Curott", "publishers": "Curott", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137501-oh-kitsune-sama\n"}
