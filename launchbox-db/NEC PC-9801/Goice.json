{"altername_name": [], "name": "Goice", "overview": "Goice contains three episodes, which tell three separate stories, but share the same villains: human-looking aliens under the command of the insane female captain Storm, and an army of mechanical dolls they use to kidnap and rape young girls from the Earth. The first episode focuses on two girls, Harue and Kyoko, who survive a car crash caused by the appearance of a giant foll that attacks the city in a Godzilla fashion, only to be captured by an army of smaller once, brought to Strom's space ship, and raped in various ways. The second episode focuses on three very young high school girls, who hear a mysterious voice on the street and run to seek help by a classmate, but are sexually assaulted by the horny alien dolls. The heroes of the third episode are two young martial artists, the boy Kenji and the girl Kaede; Kaede is kidnapped and raped by Strom and her hermaphrodite subordinate, and Kenji is trying to recue her. Goice is almost entirely pornographic; by far the largest bulk of the game is dedicated to explicit sex scenes accompanied by long passages of text. Most of the sex scenes feature short loop-like animation. The stories are entirely linear, but some scenes offer interactivity in form of a point-and-click interface, with the cursor automatically turning into the only available action on the only available spot. This interaction is used only to deplete the available actions and advance the plot.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "December 15, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Tenshindo", "publishers": "Tenshindo", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137234-goice\n"}
