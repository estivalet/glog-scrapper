{"altername_name": ["Kekkou Kamen", "Kekk\u014d Kamen: O-Shioki Paradise no Maki"], "name": "Kekkou Kamen: Oshioki Paradise no Maki", "overview": "When a Japanese game's title includes a word that can be understood as \"corporal punishment\" (shioki), it's not hard to guess the theme of the \"story\". Basically, the player is cast as one of Satan's minions, who also happens to be the new \"punishment teacher\" in the Sparta High School. As the protagonist arrives at the school, he quickly attends to his \"duties\". However, the sadist's efforts are thwarted by a mysterious, masked, completely naked woman. The player's job is to make sure this won't happen again - which means defeating the super-heroine, and continuing to torture young girls... Kekkou Kamen has elements of adventure and simulation. The player navigates the \"hero\" through top-down school grounds. Items (mostly instruments of torture) can be collected. When the protagonist is able to capture a victim, he proceeds to torture her; the player is then presented with a point-and-click interface. From time to time, turn-based battles will ensue; however, they are built more like dialogue choices rather than real RPG or strategic fights: the player has to find the right combination of various attacks and the adversary's body parts in order to inflict damage. The simulation element is evident in the detailed torture interaction and in the game's keeping track of the protagonist's \"advancements\" with his victims and opponents.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "April 8, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Dynamic Production", "publishers": "Dynamic Production", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133421-kekkou-kamen-oshioki-paradise-no-maki\n"}
