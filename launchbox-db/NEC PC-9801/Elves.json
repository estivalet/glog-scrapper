But endless wars between different races - humans, dwarves, minotaurs - have driven the peace-loving elves out. They sailed far away, to a remote land, where they decided to settle down. But alas, even in this new place they couldn't find peace! Vicious goblins began to attack the small elvish settlement. The king sends a young elf named Arayle to the goblins' lair.

Elves is a Japanese RPG with top-down world map navigation and random combat. The battles take place on a separate isometric screen. It is possible to position the controllable characters (a party of up to five) in different places on the field. Enemies also stand in rows; it is not uncommon to meet a dozen or more enemies in combat. Weapons and magic have their range, so sometimes it is necessary to position characters properly to get the maximum out of their abilities.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "October 9, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "You-En-Tai", "publishers": "You-en-tai", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/136570-elves\n"}
