Naturally, this being a hentai game, the problems are usually restricted to sexual fetishes, and the counseling often consists of helping the patients in such ways that new problems of a similar kind might arise... The game is a visual novel, with the player's input confined to standard questions about each patient, as well as occasional decision-making, which may or may not trigger particular scenes. There are no persistent verb-based interaction of any kind.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "August 11, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "May-Be Soft", "publishers": "May-Be Soft", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137389-kirishima-shinryoushitsu-no-gogo\n"}
