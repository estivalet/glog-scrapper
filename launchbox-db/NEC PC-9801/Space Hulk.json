{"altername_name": [], "name": "Space Hulk", "overview": "Space Hulk is a real-time conversion of the original board game by Games Workshop set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe. Players control a squad of Space Marines in an maze allowing 90 degree turns which they may view through multiple first person cameras or using an overhead map. Their mission: to wipe out the Genestealers, a vicious alien race inhabiting the derelict ships. The 5-man squad (sometimes accompanied by another), encased in Terminator armors and armed with long range and melee weapons, can be given tactical orders (executed simultaneously) via map - with an option to temporarily freeze time (to give player more room for thinking).", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "March 3, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Electronic Arts", "publishers": "StarCraft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Hulk_(1993_video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/134706-space-hulk\n"}
