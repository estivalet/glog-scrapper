{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gakuen Senki: Kyoufu no Puppet Keikaku", "overview": "In late 23rd century was marked by a terrible disaster - the Third World War. Years have passed since the countries affected by it started slowly rebuilding. A league of nations was formed, consisting of \"companions\" from different countries. Suzuki, the representative of Japan, was also the founder of the most prestigious school of the new era - St. Innocence Girls High School. The graduates were invited to a grand opening held by a company that was successful in manufacturing giant robots. But terrorists of an unknown origin assaulted the place, killing most of the people. All the clues lead to St. Innocence school. Suzuki sends an agent (codename \"Osamu\") to infiltrate the school and find out what is happening. The game is a Japanese-style RPG/strategy hybrid, set almost entirely within the high school. The RPG aspect is stronger than it is usually in games of this types, manifested itself not only in leveling system (experience points are awarded for each attack), equipment, usage of money, etc., but also in top-down exploration outside of the battles. Battles are usually dictated by the plot (not random), and occur in large top-down environments, which are navigated by the party of heroes in turn-based style. Battles usually end with cut-scenes featuring nudity and sexual situations.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "April 15, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Foresight", "publishers": "Foresight", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137214-gakuen-senki-kyoufu-no-puppet-keikaku\n"}
