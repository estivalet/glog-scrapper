Kyouiku Kenshuu", "overview": "Ky\u014dsuke Takamizawa is a twenty-three year old man who has been having some trouble finding a job. His last teaching experience wasn't particularly successful, and now he is out for better opportunities in the city. However, his real focus is on his charming female acquaintances - from high-school students to waitresses, neighbors, and other women populating the city. Takamizawa Ky\u014dsuke Nekketsu!! Ky\u014diku Kensh\u016b is a Japanese-style adventure that focuses on getting acquainted with and gradually conquering various female characters. The player is presented with a map of two districts, each with a dozen locations that can be freely visited. The interaction in the locations themselves is sparse, consisting of a few context-related choices. The game has an internal clock; each visit takes away at least twenty minutes of game time. Certain locations are accessible only during specific times. The main challenge lies in being in the right place at the right time in order to meet a specific character. A help screen shows habits and approximate schedules of the many female characters in the game.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "December 22, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "ZyX", "publishers": "ZyX", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133446-takamizawa-kyosuke-nekketsu-kyouiku-kenshuu\n"}
