{"altername_name": ["Chookooso Crisis"], "name": "Choukousou Crisis", "overview": "Ch\u014dk\u014ds\u014d Crisis is an example of a hentai Breakout variant. The plot involves a faraway planet sunken in corruption and sexual crimes; young girls have been kidnapped and are about to fall victims to terrible experiments. An ordinary young boy names Kenjirou is assigned with the task to travel to the building where the girls are kept, and to liberate them. To do that, he first needs to - logically - destroy layers of bricks with a ball! The player controls Kenjirou in person, his head adorned by a construction worker hat. Kenjirou runs left and right, hitting the ball with his head, hands, or feet (controlled simply by letting the ball fall at the appropriate angle). The bricks come in different colors; red ones are destroyed in one hit, blue ones require two, etc. Higher levels feature more complex brick systems, and more tough-to-break bricks. Kenjirou has limited lives, and the game is over when he lets the ball hit the floor too many times, losing all of them. Some bricks produce power-ups when destroyed; these include additional time for Kenjirou to finish the level, slowing down the ball, etc. Every level is an erotic picture obscured by the bricks and unclear colors. Once all the bricks have been destroyed, the picture becomes clear, and a sex scene follows, after which the hero ascends to the next floor, continue his perilous quest for demolition and carnal pleasure.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "April 13, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Altacia", "publishers": "Altacia", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137098-choukousou-crisis\n"}
