{"altername_name": [], "name": "Meikyuu Gakuensai: Kyuukousha no Nazo", "overview": "Ryouichi is just an ordinary teenager, who prefers spending time with pretty girls or doing nothing instead of going to classes. He and his lovely classmate Atsumi are worried about the strange events that occurred in the school lately. People have been disappearing under suspicious circumstances. To their amazement, the two young people discover a magical passageway to another world, where bunny-like pretty girls co-exist with fearsome demons, and where many other classmates are trapped as well. The mission is clear: free the kids, find a way to get home! Meiky\u016b Gakuensai: Ky\u016bk\u014dsha no Nazo is a traditional dungeon crawler with Japanese flavor - there are many dialogues and scripted events, but the gameplay is dedicated entirely to exploring pseudo-3D maze-like locations (with an auto-map feature). Combat against randomly appearing enemies is very simple: the hero can just attack or run away. However, it is possible to use healing items outside of battles, and buy and equip weapons and armor. Leveling up is automatic, as in most Japanese RPGs of the time. The game contains graphic nudity and sexual situations.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "October 28, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "D&D", "publishers": "Wishbone", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137460-meikyuu-gakuensai-kyuukousha-no-nazo\n"}
