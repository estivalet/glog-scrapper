{"altername_name": [], "name": "Circle Mate", "overview": "Hide is a member of the Club where members that enjoyed sexual pleasures were gathering. One day he gets to know that another club member Yuko is killed by the train and another club member Asako stops going to school because of that. A hired detective suspects Hide in this crime, so Hide starts his own investigation. This is an utsuge game full of depression and H scenes. The atmosphere resembles Crazy Fruit from 1992 the most. The mystery is quite shocking upon unwinding. This work has a lot of dark charm and is much less hardcore than contemporary utsuge, so should not be overlooked if you search for a good mystery story.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Bonbee Bon Bon!", "publishers": "Bonbee Bon Bon!", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/139775-circle-mate\n"}
