One day she misinterpreted her brother's flu symptoms for an incurable disease and went to search for the medicine component of virgin's grey tiny hair in St.Rodrigues Academy. To obtain the virgin's grey hair Kyoko attacks both students and teachers without constraint. This is a bakage through and through.
