{"altername_name": [], "name": "Advanced Power Dolls 2", "overview": "Advanced Power Dolls 2 is, like other installments in the series, a sci-fi mecha-themed turn-based tactical game. Visually and gameplay-wise it is nearly identical to Power Dolls 2 and Power Dolls 2 Dash, though without the selectable difficulty level of the latter. It introduces three new campaigns which depict a renewed struggle between the governments of Omni and Earth after an attempt at peaceful reconciliation by Omni was foiled. There is a greater number of selectable characters and specific vehicle requirements (types of planes, helicopters, etc.) for certain missions.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "February 23, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kogado Studio", "publishers": "Kogado Studio", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.62", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv805SM4Zyg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133408-advanced-power-dolls-2\n"}
