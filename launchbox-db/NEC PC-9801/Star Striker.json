{"altername_name": [], "name": "Star Striker", "overview": "Star Striker is a fast-paced doujin shooter for the PC-9801 by Promiscence (the same company of atomic punker). There's no power ups, your ship fires a broad forward shot and homing missiles when there's something to target. You don't have a conventional number of lives, either, with a score deduction for dying followed by immediate re-spawn. There are no bombs in this game, with the second button you can accelerate your ship.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Promiscence", "publishers": "TAKERU", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/39lAilcINz8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/139751-star-striker\n"}
