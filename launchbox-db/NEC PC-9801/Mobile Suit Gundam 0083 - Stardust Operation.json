{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Operation", "overview": "The events of Stardust Operation takes place in UC (Universal Century) 0083, four years after the devastating One Year War between the Earth federation and the Principality of Zeon. Even though the latter lost the war, rogue organizations affiliated with it continue to pose a threat to the Federation. One of their plans involves dropping a space colony onto the Earth, to damage its food supply. The war has ended, but the hostilities are far from being extinguished. Stardust Operation is a strategy game based on the events of the anime Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory. The player takes control of either Federation or Zeon forces, playing through two independent scenarios that evolve linearly, from mission to mission. Each mission is shaped like a tactical battle, during which the player navigates units (mostly mechas) over the battle field in turn-based fashion. Unlike in Family Soft's previous Gundam strategy games, one-on-one battles are automatic; the player chooses the weapon to use in the attack before it initiates. Missions usually involve specific goals, and are interspersed by dialogue and cutscenes.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "December 20, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Family Soft", "publishers": "Family Soft", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/135444-mobile-suit-gundam-0083-stardust-operation\n"}
