{"altername_name": ["Nana Eiy\u016b Monogatari"], "name": "Nana Eiyuu Monogatari", "overview": "Bandits attack a quiet village and kidnap a female magician. The two bravest local warriors are quite unable to protect their homeland by themselves, so they seek the help of a wandering adventurer named Ray. Ray agrees to rescue the girl and teams up with other heroes, each with his or her own motivation for the battle. Eventually, seven heroes travel together on a quest to stop a dangerous person who has forgotten his heritage in search for power. Nana Eiyuu Monogatari is a tactical role-playing game. The gameplay system is very simple: the player navigates up to seven heroes over the battle field in a turn-based fashion. Each character possesses one type of attack (melee or ranged); in addition, a few characters can cast basic magic spells. Characters level up automatically after having performed a set number of attacks. There is no inventory or equipment in the game. Some of the cutscenes are erotically-themed.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "March 10, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Himeya Soft", "publishers": "Himeya Soft", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133390-nana-eiyuu-monogatari\n"}
