{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hana no Kiouku", "overview": "Hana no Kioku consists of five episodes, all of which can be accessed from the main menu, in no particular order: The young school girl Chiko is taking a subway train and is sexually molested by what she thinks is a chihan (a person with the popular Japanese \"hobby\" of touching young girls on the trains). However, the chihan turns out to be a young girl named Kiko, who wears a rather elaborate disguise. An episode dedicated to another popular Japanese theme: tentacle sex. A young girl named Mei thinks about anime stories and brave heroes who defeat monsters; at that moment, she is sexually assaulted by a horribly-looking giant squid monster. Mei is back in school, but this time she is not the player-controlled character; the latter is now a female teacher named Sumi, who has ordered Mei to stay in the classroom after the lesson, in order to have sex with her. A school girl named Saki is sick and is lying on the bed in the school hospital. From that point, the story can branch two different ways: either she is being raped by Sumi, or seduced by the nurse Aki. Back to Kiko from the first story; she is the playable character now, and, depending on the story branch, she either waits for her boyfriend and has sex with him, or goes outside in a disguise already seen in the first episode mentioned. All the episodes are visual novels with very little interaction; the player is only allowed to make a few choices. However, the choices usually change the direction of the events significantly, up to the point of leading to completely different situations.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "June 9, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Foster", "publishers": "Foster", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137282-hana-no-kiouku\n"}
