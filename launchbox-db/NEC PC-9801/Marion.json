{"altername_name": [], "name": "Marion", "overview": "In this game, the player is entrusted with supervising and managing the life of a highly advanced android, who looks like a young pretty girl and is commonly called Marion. Marion is a simulation game. Its main gameplay activity is to make schedules and choose activities for the sexy android. Depending on the player's way of managing Marion's life, she can become a different person, gaining proficiency in different professions and spheres of life. When making a schedule, the player has the choice between different activities, sub-divided into three categories: Training, Test, and Maintenance. The last one allows to immediately increase Marion's main parameters: CPU, legs, arms, or body. Training includes combat-related activities: practice shooting, sending Marion to the army, etc., but also other activities such as sports and dancing. Test is more oriented towards professional education, including sending Marion to work in a hospital, clean floors, or even become a call girl for escort service. Each one of those activities increases some of Marion's secondary parameters and decreases others. For example, going to the army increases strength and stamina, but decreases beauty level, etc. If Marion focuses on a certain activity, the player will be shown random cut scenes, most of which contain nudity and explicit sex. The game can be completed in a very short time, but the various endings and the inability to see all the cut scenes during one play-through encourage replaying it in a different way.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "March 31, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "May-Be Soft", "publishers": "May-Be Soft", "genres": "Life Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137454-marion\n"}
