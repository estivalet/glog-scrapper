{"altername_name": ["Jiin"], "name": "Jinn: Eternal Hero", "overview": "The hero of this game is much more interested in pretty girls than in ancient prophecies and religious rituals. However, once he finds out that his sweetheart Adiana is a descendant of an ancient god, and that young men of the village participate in a dangerous ritual in order to be chosen as her husband, the hero decides he must act. Little does he know that this would just be the beginning of a long adventure, involving all this stuff he is not interested in... plus lots of pretty girls! Jinn: Eternal Hero is a Japanese-style RPG with randomly appearing enemies and turn-based combat, with an unusual (for Japanese RPGs) perspective: the entire game uses first-person view, including town and dungeon navigation, similarly to Bard's Tale games, in pseudo-3D environment. The game has several cutscenes that include nudity and sexual situations.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "February 9, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tenshindo", "publishers": "Tenshindo", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/130943-jinn-eternal-hero\n"}
