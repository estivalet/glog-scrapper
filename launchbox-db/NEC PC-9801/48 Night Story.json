{"altername_name": [], "name": "48 Night Story", "overview": "48 Night Story has, despite its name, no story (on the game's title screen, the number \"8\" is written by combining the international signs for \"male\" and \"female\"...). The game is entirely dedicated to sex and can be therefore considered a sex simulation. There are 48 young girls to choose from. Each of them has a name and a short biography, including likes and dislikes, sexual experience, etc. After choosing a girl, the game has to match her portrait by clicking on one of the four cards hiding pictures of different girls. Then the player goes through the girl's bio, asking a limited amount of questions. Then it is time to choose one of the many available sexual positions, trying to choose the one the girl would be most comfortable with, according to her data known to the player. The actual sex scene proceeds then automatically.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "August 21, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Silky's", "publishers": "Silky's", "genres": "Life Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.31", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137030-48-night-story\n"}
