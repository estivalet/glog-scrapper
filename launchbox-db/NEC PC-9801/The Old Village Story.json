{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Old Village Story", "overview": "King Kaiser, the mighty ruler of the country Fa-Ral, had a daughter named Lisa, who became gravely ill. Anxious to know what will become of her and his kingdom, the king looks into a magic crystal. The crystal tells him that the one who can make things right is a boy named Shion, who lives in a quiet village far away from the capital city. The king tries to find Shion, but forces of darkness have plans of their own... Despite its RPG-like premise and interface, The Old Village Story is a pure adventure game. The player navigates Shion (and another character during the second half of the game) through top-down environments, exploring towns and wilderness areas, entering buildings, and talking to people to gather information and advance the plot. There are no real puzzles in the game, and the challenge lies mostly in finding the right path in maze-like locations.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "December 23, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Enix Corporation", "publishers": "Enix Corporation", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137504-the-old-village-story\n"}
