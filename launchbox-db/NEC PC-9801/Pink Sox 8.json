Rather than being a true simulation game, however, it is a simple arcade-style game where the player moves a paddle left and right, trying to connect with falling objects such as rocks, chunks of meat, Y chromosomes, etc. Depending on the type and the amount of objects caught the player is treated to view a picture of the creature that has evolved as a result.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "August 26, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Wendy Magazine", "publishers": "Wendy Magazine", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137714-pink-sox-8\n"}
