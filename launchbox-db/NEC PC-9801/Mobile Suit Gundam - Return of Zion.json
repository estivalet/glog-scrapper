{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mobile Suit Gundam: Return of Zion", "overview": "After the Principality of Zeon (\"Zion\" in early transliterations) was defeated by the Earth Federation, some of its members retreated into space, preparing for a large-scale invasion. The moment came when the Federation became weakened after the Gryps War. The Neo-Zeon sent its army onto the Earth, seizing a location in Africa thanks to the help of the Principality loyalists who still remained on Earth. The seemingly never-ending war between the Federation and Zeon has entered a new phase. Return of Zion is a strategy game based on the anime franchise Gundam. The player controls the forces of the Earth Federation. The game is mission-based; each mission is shaped as a tactical turn-based battle that takes place on a defined map. The player can choose unit types and formations, position them on the map, and then engage in battle against the opposing force. Units may consist of infantry mechas, tanks, and other kinds of machines. One-on-one battles take place on a separate screen, and are actively controlled by the player, who is able to choose the type of weapon to use or retreat from the battle.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "April 9, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Family Soft", "publishers": "Family Soft", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133386-mobile-suit-gundam-return-of-zion\n"}
