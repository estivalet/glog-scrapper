{"altername_name": ["Injiu Genmu"], "name": "Injuu Genmu", "overview": "The plot of Inj\u016b Genmu is rather simple: the King of Beasts commands you, a lowly minion, to venture into the world of humans and bring him young, pretty girls. To do that, he must defeat them in the traditional Japanese matching card game hanafuda. The gameplay is basically a series of hanafuda matches, against increasingly tough opponents. After the player has won a match, he is treated to a series of explicit images depicting the inexplicably popular phenomenon of Japanese erotic tradition: young girls being raped by a tentacle monster.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "December 15, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ringer Bell", "publishers": "Ringer Bell", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137324-injuu-genmu\n"}
