{"altername_name": ["Block Wars V"], "name": "Block Quest V", "overview": "Block Quest V is a Breakout clone with adult content. The player must keep the ball from falling out the bottom of the screen, while at the same time attempting to destroy all the blocks on the screen using the ball. There are no powerups, but there are a wide variety of different block types including blocks that switch on and off and blocks that move. The player can also shake the playfield to adjust the ball's trajectory, much like tilting in a pinball game. If the game continues for long enough, the ball will move faster and faster, but will eventually explode into three separate balls which move slower again. There are a total of nine areas with eleven stages each. Each area has a theme (hospital, restaurant, school), and a girl who matches the theme (nurse, waitress, student). As the player clears the stages, the player is rewarded with several pictures of the \"stage girl\" in varying stages of undress.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "March 3, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Wiz", "publishers": "Wiz", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137074-block-quest-v\n"}
