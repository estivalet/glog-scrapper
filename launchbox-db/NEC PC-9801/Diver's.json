{"altername_name": [], "name": "Diver's", "overview": "In the year 2065, the Earth's ecological system has collapsed. Global pollution made it impossible to further dwell on the planet under natural conditions. Human beings were forces to construct huge cities in artificial environment, known as \"cyclones\". New technology has opened ways to new kinds of entertainment - namely violent battles between cybernetically enhanced fighters... Diver's is a simulation game somewhat similar to Princess Maker with cut-scenes (mostly of erotic nature) breaking the daily training routine. Taking the role of a manager named Shirou, the player can choose to train one of the four available female fighters. The goal is to raise the girl's battle parameters by filling our her schedule with daily assignments. These include various kinds of physical training (attack, defense, etc.), mental exercises, sparring with a partner, etc. In order to keep the girl relaxed, it is necessary to rest from time to time, as well as perform some leisurely activities, such as shopping, gambling, or relaxing in a spa. The event battles are presented as short animated clips of the opponent attacking the girl of player's choice. There is no interaction during the battles, and their outcome depends on the fighters' parameters, as well as advices the player has to give his/her fighter before the battle.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "August 11, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mink", "publishers": "Mink", "genres": "Life Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/136569-divers\n"}
