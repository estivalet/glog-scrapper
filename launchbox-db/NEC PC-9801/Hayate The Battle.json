{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hayate The Battle", "overview": "Hayate: The Battle is set in the same universe and features the characters from Jik\u016b S\u014dsakan: Hayate. Unlike its predecessor, it is not story-driven and focuses entirely on battles. In the first game, all the fights were dictated by the story, and the obligatory player-controlled character was Hayate himself. In Hayate: The Battle, the player can choose any of the characters from the previous game, male and female. The battle mode allows the player to choose the opponent as well; it also has a two-player mode. The tournament mode allows the player to choose the playable character, but not the opponents. The game introduces the opponents by itself, increasing the difficulty as the battles progress. After the player has won a battle, a scene with nudity and sexual content is displayed (those scenes do not have a connection with the story). There are adjustable difficulty levels as well.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Altacia", "publishers": "Altacia", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/139417-hayate-the-battle\n"}
