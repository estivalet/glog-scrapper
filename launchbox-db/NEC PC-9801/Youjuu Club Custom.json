{"altername_name": [], "name": "Youjuu Club Custom", "overview": "Y\u014dj\u016b Club Custom is a simple tile-matching game with a gruesome twist: as the player completes rounds of the game, horrifying beasts come closer to sexually attacking young girls. Each stage corresponds to a rape scene dedicated to a particular girl/beast encounter. There are two main modes in the game: picture-matching and word-matching. Both follow the same principle: the player sees a screen with hidden tiles, and the goal is to uncover them and match identically-looking ones. Each time the player selects a wrong tile, he loses a \"life\". The difference between the mode is rather self-explanatory: in the word-matching mode, the player matches Chinese characters (\"kanji\") instead of pictures. Stages and rounds become more difficult as the game advances, with more different pictures/words to match, less \"lives\" etc.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "November 15, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "D.O.", "publishers": "D.O.", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/140635-youjuu-club-custom\n"}
