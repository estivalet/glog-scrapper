This time, it is centred upon Gainax's famous Gunbuster animation videos. You, as an alpha-class Top, are supposed to win three keys to pilot the Great Gunbuster robot against the cosmic threat to humanity. The keys are held by Jung-Freud, Kazumi (oneesama) and Noriko, and you must retrieve the keys by defeating each character in a quiz game, which has the side-effect of stripping them of all their clothes. Each character asks questions around a certain theme; Jung-Freud asks about the Soviet Union and military technology, Kazumi asks about fashion and Noriko asks about cult science fiction and animation.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "March 24, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gainax", "publishers": "Gainax", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/129040-dennou-gakuen-iii-top-o-nerae\n"}
