{"altername_name": [], "name": "Lemon Angel", "overview": "The protagonist of Lemon Angel is Tomo, a high school student and one of the mahjong opponents in Mahjong Lemon Angel. This game however, has nothing to do with mahjong and plays - despite a rudimentary Japanese-style adventure verb interface - like a very basic visual novel, with right choices advancing the story and wrong ones leading to various Game Over situations. The plot involves Tomo meeting her friends Erika and Miki, only to become trapped in a magical dimension with her friends gone. Tomo must travel to various worlds in order to find them; these worlds have varied themes and settings, including an alien attack on a spaceship, a country populated by giant sexually abusive mushrooms, a realm that changes Tomo's gender, etc. Explicit sexual scenes occupy a large portion of the game.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "July 21, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Fairy Dust", "publishers": "Fairy Dust", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137406-lemon-angel\n"}
