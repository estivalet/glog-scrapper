{"altername_name": [], "name": "Jealousy", "overview": "An ordinary Japanese young man named Fujibayashi Kotarou was playing a computer game at his friend's house. Upon returning home at night, he was approached by mobsters, who demanded money. With debts everywhere and without real means to earn money, Kotarou opts to work for a dubious night club manager as a host. He finds it hard to adjust to the new life style, which brings not only danger and violence, but also sexual experiences he hasn't even dreamed of before... Jealousy can be classified as a visual novel, though the choices the player makes during the game tend to have little impact on the story progression, and are quite rare. Most of the game consists of text accompanied by pictures or (more rarely) animated scenes of sexual nature.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "July 14, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Inter Heart", "publishers": "Inter Heart", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137375-jealousy\n"}
