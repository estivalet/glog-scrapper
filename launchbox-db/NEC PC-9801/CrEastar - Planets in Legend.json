{"altername_name": [], "name": "CrEastar: Planets in Legend", "overview": "CrEastar is an RPG game set on another planet. Players take the role of Alex, a warrior in a mecha suit who witnesses the destruction of his hometown by invaders from space. The game plays out like a typical turn-based RPG with some exceptions such as the ability to target multiple enemies in one attack and healing by taking steps. Alex also gains back some HP after each battle. Alex can increase his max HP by either leveling up after gathering enough experience or finding power-ups hidden in various areas and can jump to get over gaps in caves. The enemies are not visible on the map and the random encounter rate is set quite high. Battles are shown in an over-the-shoulder perspective similar to Phantasy Star II. Enemies can be at different distances to the protagonist, the further they are away from him, the more likely the player is to escape from a battle or attack first.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "May 10, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Bothtec", "publishers": "Bothtec", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/127702-creastar-planets-in-legend\n"}
