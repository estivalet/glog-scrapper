{"altername_name": [], "name": "Asoko no Koufuku", "overview": "The theme of the game is metamorphosis. There are several short fetish stories with different protagonists and progression of interacting with surrounding items at a specific order to answer a fetishist question in each scene. What a crazy game. It was supposed to be based on manga, but it soon flew in a different direction. The scenes on the screen are totally surreal and mindblowing. The minigame is quite entertaining and it's always possible to summon the cardinal who says what to do next. Fetish erotics mixed with gags supported by great music create a truly unique atmosphere that pushes to keep on playing even despite the somewhat slow minigame progression. That's truly a masterpiece.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Zeit", "publishers": "Zeit", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147567-asoko-no-koufuku\n"}
