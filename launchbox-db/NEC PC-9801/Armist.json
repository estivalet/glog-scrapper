{"altername_name": [], "name": "Armist", "overview": "In the future, advanced genetic studies opened unseen possibilities for mankind. After years of research, it finally became possible to create artificial human beings with animal traits, the so-called deminoids. The player takes the role of the head of a detective agency named Armist; two pretty female deminoids (with bunny and cat ears) are his trustworthy partners. Investigating a murder in a huge deminoid-producing company, the hero will eventually discover the truth about this scientific achievement and all its implications... Armist is a Japanese-style adventure, with still screens as locations and menu-based command input. Typically, the player has to exhaust all the options in every location to advance the plot. Commands mostly include examining objects in rooms and sharing opinions with the two partners. Conveniently, commands that do not lead to a new text message any more are removed from the menu, so that the player can concentrate on the others.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Basement", "publishers": "Basement", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/132408-armist\n"}
