{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mime", "overview": "Once upon a time, there was harmony and balance in the world. Four kingdoms of humans have watched over the four elements. But then a traitor appeared, who has angered the Goddess with his selfish deeds. The balance was destroyed, the elements were no more in harmony, and the world plunged into chaos... Twelve thousand years later, a young knight named Eagle Windeed has been having a strange dream. Maybe there is still salvation for the human race. Maybe it is still possible to make peace with the higher beings. Eagle arrives at a tavern near the Tree Dungeon, determined to find out what his dream meant... Mime is a dungeon crawler: the entire game is set in a maze-like dungeon environments (with auto-map). There are no \"safe\" areas; random enemies can pop out anywhere (the random encounter rate is however quite low). Eagle starts alone, but later in the game three other heroes join him. The battles are turn-based, utilizing the standard \"attack/magic\" formula. There are a few explicit sex scenes in the game.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "September 29, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Studio Twinkle", "publishers": "Studio Twinkle", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133384-mime\n"}
