{"altername_name": [], "name": "Wrestle Angels V3", "overview": "Wrestle Angels V3 is the seventh and final PC-98 title in the Wrestle Angels series, again featuring the in-depth management simulation style introduced in Wrestle Angels V1. As usual, Wrestle Angels V3 allows the player to train several female wrestlers, not only controlling their professional training, but also assigning free-time activities and taking them to different locations. All the girls have parameters that can be increased by training in different ways. Unlike V1 and V2, this title is a completely new entry in the franchise rather than a remake. The familiar wrestlers from the previous games, led by the legendary Mighty Yukiko, have to unite against a new wrestler, who claims to have superior skills. The game has an even heavier emphasis on dialogue and adventure-like elements, with more locations and more personal involvement with the wrestlers. As before, the matches themselves are turn-based, and can be set on auto. This time around, the player can even choose not to see most of the matches displayed at all, with the exception of the most important ones.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "May 24, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "KSS", "publishers": "KSS", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/131112-wrestle-angels-v3\n"}
