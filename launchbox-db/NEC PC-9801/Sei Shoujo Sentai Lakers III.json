This installment in the series features a very similar tactical combat system, granting each character a variety of attacks with different ranges that deplete special points. It differs from its predecessors by having much more developed adventure-like visual novel segments. The game has an internal clock for each day, and the player is free to choose various locations within the school and the city from a menu. Each such visit advances the clock by a certain amount of time. Depending on the player's choices different scenes can be unlocked.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "April 26, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Apple Pie", "publishers": "Apple Pie", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137603-sei-shoujo-sentai-lakers-iii\n"}
