{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bishoujo wa Check ga Osuki", "overview": "You participate in personality quizzes with several girls giving Yes or No answers. If you appear to be the personality the girl likes - she will be undressing with each new round. The mechanics are simple, but fun and engaging enough.
