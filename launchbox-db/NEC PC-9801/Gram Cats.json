{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gram Cats", "overview": "High school girl Sayaka is kidnapped by the secret organization Eagle (Earth Defense Force) on the way back home. According to the organization's commander, Sayaka has a special ESP that can help fight against aliens. Sayaka acquires a supernatural ability to transform into a cat and her first mission is to infiltrate Momozakura student Academy which is a base of alien forces. Despite the synopsis the game's main advantages lie in graphics, not in story. There are two mini-games on the way to the alien base and a special card game as well. I could not even pass through the maze corridors. And the main feature of the game is an ability to change clothes on will - that's a definite step to moe games.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "January 1, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "DOTT Plan", "publishers": "DOTT Plan", "genres": "Visual Novel", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/140840-gram-cats\n"}
