{"altername_name": [], "name": "Like", "overview": "Hero is summoned from America by his father and forcibly put into all girls school to find a bride. After releasing \"Kiss\" Ange got a lot of attention. And Ange had really cute character designs. There are only three commands to choose from, so system-wise it's a step back from \"Kiss\". There are all kinds of girls, but need to choose just one and turn everyone else down. But if decision is made, game goes right to ending and that was weird. The only bright point is actually the ending where you get to see the afterstories of each of girls you dumped. So it's a charage through and through, and rather mediocre one.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "November 3, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Ange", "publishers": "Ange", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/139557-like\n"}
