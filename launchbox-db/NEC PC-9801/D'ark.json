{"altername_name": [], "name": "D'ark", "overview": "Somewhere lies a beautiful island, which for centuries has been the battle ground for the titanic war between the forces of Light and Darkness. No side was able to control the island for a long time; after a while, the war raged anew, and the island fell under the control of the other side. Forty years ago, the Light, represented by human being, prevailed in the latest battle. The island was occupied by humans. One day, a strange-looking man appeared on it. He had no memory of his own past, except his name, Dulldeek, and the hatred to humans. Without knowing what this hatred was caused by, Dulldeek feels the rage of the Dark inside him. He decides to infiltrate the castle of Veevik, the humans' fortress, to satisfy his burning anger... D'ark is a very simple solo first-person dungeon crawler. As Dulldeek, the player navigates maze-like pseudo-3D dungeons (with auto-mapping), encountering randomly appearing enemies and fighting them in turn-based combat to gain experience points and level up. The magic system is very basic, the sole choice being \"attack spell\" or \"healing spell\", both of which consume magic points. A somewhat unusual feature is the option to turn off random encounters completely at any time", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "December 11, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Himeya Soft, Inc", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/127170-dark\n"}
