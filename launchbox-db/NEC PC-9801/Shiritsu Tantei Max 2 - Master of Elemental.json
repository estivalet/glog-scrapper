{"altername_name": [], "name": "Shiritsu Tantei Max 2: Master of Elemental", "overview": "The great womanizing detective Max, whom we met in the first Shiritsu Tantei Max game is back! This time, he is taken to a magical parallel dimension, which is populated by elemental spirits. It turns out that the Galactic Orb that was in Max's possession awakened the evil witch Morgan, who had been previously sealed by the elemental rulers. Balance is destroyed, and magical creatures have gone berserk. Together with his companion, the little pixie Viewer, Max has to undo the damage and stop Morgan from taking over the world. Unlike the first game, Shiritsu Tantei Max 2: Master of Elemental is an RPG. It plays like a fairly traditional Japanese-style representative of the genre: the player navigates Max over the top-down world, fighting random enemies in turn-based fashion, and visiting towns for rest and supplies. Characters have typical RPG proficiencies (for example, Viewer has low HP and weak attacks, but can cast healing magic, etc.). The characters level up automatically, as per standard Japanese RPG rule. The adult content comes in form of over-sexed female demonic enemies, some of which fully undress upon defeat, as well as during Max's dates. In towns, the player can use the special \"Hunt\" command to locate the available girls. Some of them will agree to date Max. Staying at the inn will then trigger an erotic picture with the girl in question.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "August 2, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Agumix", "publishers": "Agumix", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133433-shiritsu-tantei-max-2-master-of-elemental\n"}
