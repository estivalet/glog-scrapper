{"altername_name": [], "name": "GaoGao! 4th: Canaan: Yakusoku no Chi", "overview": "The fourth entry in the GaoGao series is set in the same post-apocalyptic world as the two previous games. In the future, a failed biological experiment caused widespread mutations, leading to a total separation of human civilization and the mutated tribes of \"animal people\". The events of the game begin shortly after the end of the previous installment. Human civilization is nearly destroyed; the remaining humans live in shelters, dreaming of the \"promised land\" Canaan, somewhere \"near the end of the world\", where there is enough food for everyone and where mutants can't enter. The game has two protagonists: a human boy who has lost his parents and who swears to himself to find Canaan, and Wolf, the mutant hero of the previous game, with his colorful female companions. Eventually their paths cross - but will they able to understand each other and bring peace to the troublesome world?.. The game plays similarly to the other GaoGao entries: the player interacts with the environment by selecting verb commands (\"Look\", \"Talk\", \"Move\", etc.). The interaction has been somewhat simplified compared to the previous games, with less object sub-menus and more automatized progression, almost (but not quite) to the point of becoming a visual novel. As in the other GaoGao games, there are scenes with nudity and sexual situations, featuring both \"animal fetish\" and human ladies.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "April 11, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Four Nine", "publishers": "Four-Nine", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137678-gaogao-4th-canaan-yakusoku-no-chi\n"}
