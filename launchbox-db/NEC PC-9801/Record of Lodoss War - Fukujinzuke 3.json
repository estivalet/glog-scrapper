{"altername_name": ["Lodoss Tou Senki: Fukujindzuke 3"], "name": "Record of Lodoss War: Fukujinzuke 3", "overview": "The third Fukujinzuke installment returns to the mini-game format of the first, abandoning the more developed RPG-like scenarios of the second. The game features the same six characters as in the previous entry. Like before, these characters can be swapped with those of Record of Lodoss War II: Goshiki no Mary\u016b; new to this installment is the possibility to import and export characters to Sword World PC. There are only two battle scenarios and no possibility to visit a town or acquire items. The dungeon exploration mode is gone as well and is replaced by a quiz mini-game in which the player takes control of Parn, one of the series' main protagonists, on a quest to defeat Emperor Beld. The player has to answer trivia questions within time limit and use abilities of Parn's companions to make this task easier.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "February 19, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Humming Bird Soft", "publishers": "Humming Bird Soft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133776-record-of-lodoss-war-fukujinzuke-3\n"}
