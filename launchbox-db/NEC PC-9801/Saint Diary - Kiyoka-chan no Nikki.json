{"altername_name": [], "name": "Saint Diary: Kiyoka-chan no Nikki", "overview": "Saint Diary is a visual novel focusing on the romantic life of a high school student named Kiyoka (the Chinese character used to spell here name means \"saint\"), who works as a waitress at the local cafe during a vacation. The protagonist of the game is a male college student who frequents the cafe and gradually develops a relationship with Kiyoka. Though there are two other female characters in the game, the dating aspect focuses exclusively on Kiyoka. Like in most visual novels, interaction is sporadic and limited; as opposed to most representatives of the genre, instead of making a choice between two or more context-specific actions the player is prompted to select a command (\"Look\", \"Talk\", or \"Action\") within a time limit. Failure to make a choice, however, does not incur any penalty besides slightly influencing subsequent events. When dating Kiyoka the player is able to choose a location for the date, which also affects the following scenes. Eventually the couple engages in sexual intercourse, which is displayed explicitly.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "November 29, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Desire", "publishers": "Desire", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137572-saint-diary-kiyoka-chan-no-nikki\n"}
