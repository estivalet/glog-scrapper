{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tougenkyou: Harlem Fantasy", "overview": "No, this game has nothing to do with Harlem (the title is a misspelling of harem by the Japanese developers), but rather with ancient China. Basically, it makes fun of some of the most venerable Chinese myths, presenting legendary pseudo-historical characters in a comical and obscene way. The story begins as a young warrior named Li is playing \"peeping Tom\" with the goddess/empress Xiwangmu, the Queen-Mother of West. Enraged by Li's actions, the old court magician Taishang Laojun casts a spell on him, turning him into a woman. Now the poor guy has to find a way to reverse to his true macho self - but not before he defeats the best female warriors of the country in combat... T\u014dgenky\u014d is an adventure game with strategic battles. The player navigates Li through the top-down world; dialogues are displayed as still shots with menu choices, viewed from first-person perspective, typically for Japanese adventures. At certain points Li will have to fight other girls. The battles are turn-based. Both Li and the enemy character are dealt a deck of cards. The player has to choose a card (attacking, healing, etc.) for the attack move, and click on a rapidly spinning additional card to enhance the attack - or make it fail. During the enemy turn, the player also must click on a card, with different results. The game features a lot of explicit sexual situations, some of which are quite \"hardcore\".", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Swat", "publishers": "Swat", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137653-tougenkyou-harlem-fantasy\n"}
