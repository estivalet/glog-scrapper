{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Horde", "overview": "You are Chauncey, a serving lad who saves his monarch from choking on his meal. The King rewards you with his magical sword, Grimthwacker, and a village, and the mission to go forth and prosper by felling waves of Hordlings, who are bent on eating everything in the province. The better you get at defending villagers, crops, and cows from Hordlings, the better equipped you become. Success wins you further favor from the King, along with bigger challenges and more enmity from the evil High Chancellor. There are several types of Hordlings, each with their peculiar style of picking through the edibles under your care. Success is measured by how many villagers and crops survive each season's gluttonous attacks.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "April 28, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Toys for Bob", "publishers": "Arrow Micro-Techs", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/139653-the-horde\n"}
