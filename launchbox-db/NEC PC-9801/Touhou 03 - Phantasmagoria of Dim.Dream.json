Dream"], "name": "Touhou 03: Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream", "overview": "While enjoying a quiet morning walk, the local shrine maiden Reimu Hakurei stumbles across some curious ruins a short distance from the Hakurei Shrine's gateway. Spotting Mima and Marisa Kirisame among the crowd gathered, Reimu inquires about the ruins' sudden appearance and is given a flier indicating that the Grand Opening is to occur shortly and that those who enter will have their wishes granted. Unable to locate any sort of entrance into the ruins, the group instead discovers a notice posted nearby which warns that the ruins can only support one visitor. Thus those wishing to enter the ruins decide to stage an impromptu competition: the one who defeats all others will be allowed to enter the ruins and have their wishes granted.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "December 29, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "ZUN Soft", "publishers": "Amusement Makers", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.85", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touhou_Project", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_y_9OsOKj8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75781-touhou-03-phantasmagoria-of-dimdream\n"}
