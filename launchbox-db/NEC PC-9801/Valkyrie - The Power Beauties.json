The cat promptly explained that it was not a cat, but a creature from the Magic World. Once in a thousand or so years, a fighting competition is being held between the best female fighters of the Magic World. The winner becomes the next queen. The referee however should be a human being; and this time, the honor belongs to our friend Tarou!", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "February 28, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Discovery", "publishers": "Discovery", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106159-valkyrie-the-power-beauties\n"}
