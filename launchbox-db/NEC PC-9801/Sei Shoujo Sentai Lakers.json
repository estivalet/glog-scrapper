{"altername_name": ["Battle Team Lakers", "Holy Girl Force Lakers"], "name": "Sei Shoujo Sentai Lakers", "overview": "Akira Daidouji was just an ordinary teenager until one night he had a strange dream. When he woke up he was contacted by a mysterious stranger from another planet who told him that the Gadram Empire is attacking his homeland because they need the power of the so-called Laker Crystals to survive. Akira was chosen as the next guardian of the crystals. In order to defeat Galvan, the dark leader of Gadram, Akira has to discover five young girls with special powers and assemble a team for the upcoming battle. Sei Shoujo Sentai Lakers is primarily a turn-based tactical game, though it also has extensive cutscenes and sporadic adventure-like menu-based interaction for certain events (mostly those of sexual nature). Battles are dictated by the plot and consist entirely of navigating a team led by Akira and consisting of various female characters over isometric battle screens. Each character has a variety of attacks at her disposal and can be slightly customized before combat. There is also a light role-playing element in that the characters become progressively stronger; however, this is not affected by the player's choices.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "December 25, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Apple Pie", "publishers": "Apple Pie", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137601-sei-shoujo-sentai-lakers\n"}
