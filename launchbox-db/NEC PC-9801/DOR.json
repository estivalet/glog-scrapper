{"altername_name": [], "name": "DOR", "overview": "DOR features three independent scenarios, which are not connected to each other story-wise and can be accessed directly from the main menu. The first scenario depicts a meeting between the male protagonist and a mysterious young woman near a giant observatory telescope. The hero finds out about the woman's tragic past and proceeds to \"console\" her. The second scenario describes a telephone date a boy named Takeshi arranges with two \"OLs\" (\"office ladies\"). The hero must manipulate the conversation in such a way that he will win the graces of both. The third scenario involves a cute female vampire named Kanako visiting the (again, male) hero in his apartment. Kanako is hungry and needs blood, so the protagonist has to come up with the right idea of what to demand in exchange for it. All the three scenarios share the same gameplay: at every screen, the player is presented with a short list of possible answers/actions (usually 3). Some situations require to go through the choices several times in order to advance the story, while others contain \"bad\" choices that lead to Game Over.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "February 28, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "D.O.", "publishers": "D.O.", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133309-dor\n"}
