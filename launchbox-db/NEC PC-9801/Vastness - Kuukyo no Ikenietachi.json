{"altername_name": [], "name": "Vastness: Kuukyo no Ikenietachi", "overview": "Vastness consists of three mini-stories unrelated to each other. The first follows the sexual escapades of a female student who seduces her schoolmates; the second mainly focuses on a treatment of a particular kind received by a man from a female doctor and nurse in a hospital; the third tells the story of a young girl who discovers her sexuality and eventually gets married. The first story has no gameplay of any kind. The second has a few screens with an adventure-like point-and-click interface. The third is built like a visual novel: at certain points the player is prompted to make a choice that would scarcely affect the main story but add or subtract certain sexual scenes instead.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "June 11, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Mediax", "publishers": "Mediax", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137690-vastness-kuukyo-no-ikenietachi\n"}
