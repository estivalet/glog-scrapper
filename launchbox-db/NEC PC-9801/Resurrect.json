One of the most difficult pc-98 games to clear. It became legendary for that. System is point and click, but game is very punishing on clicking wrong objects and on clicking some objects excessive number of times. Like, to make girl feel good, you need to click like three times on this part, no more, no less. Sometimes there was no feedback until you click some object for like 5 times. Sometimes you need to click on the area of just a few pixels and not next to it. It's a kusoge, but it spawned lots of flame and competition.
