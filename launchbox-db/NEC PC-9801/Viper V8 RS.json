{"altername_name": [], "name": "Viper V8 RS", "overview": "The second entry in Sogna's long-running Viper franchise, Viper V-8 has the same format as its predecessor: three separate short stories with minimal interaction and animated sex scenes. The three stories are: Friday the 18th: Obviously, a parody on horror movies, telling the story of three young girls who were sexually assaulted by mysterious masked men when camping near a forest. Demon's Night is set in medieval times and describes a battle of three young heroes against a vicious demon. One of them is killed in battle, while the other (a girl) is captured by the demon; the remaining warrior, a young man named Ryu, has to rescue his friend. Alien Wars takes place in the future. A young space pilot named Sylvie is ambushed and captured by aliens who have nothing else in mind but to have sex with her... There is some rudimentary interaction in all the three stories: \"Friday the 18th\" allows the player to switch from one heroine to another (even though there is only one correct way to do that); \"Demon's Night\" has a scene with pseudo-RPG turn-based combat (pre-determined results); both \"Demon's Night\" and \"Alien Wars\" offer some menu-based choices to make, some of which will lead to Game Over. VIPER-V8 RS version: Upgrade kit for the original PC98 versions to add PCM voice and enhanced gameplay previously available in the X68000 version. Game package includes twelve page manual, five diskettes, registration card, and a pair of promotional flyers.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "May 26, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Sogna", "publishers": "Sogna", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.62", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133090-viper-v8-rs\n"}
