The game does not offer a new storyline in the introduction and instead simply allows players to control female fighters and compete in an enigmatic tournament. Unlike the first game, the player can select between five characters in the story mode, defeating the opponents one-by-one in a linear fashion and facing two non-controllable enemies in the end. All the five characters are new - none of the heroines of the previous game returns.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "October 27, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Agumix", "publishers": "Agumix", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106149-the-queen-of-duellist-gaiden\n"}
