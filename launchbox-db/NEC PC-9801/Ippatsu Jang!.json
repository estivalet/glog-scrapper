{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ippatsu Jang!", "overview": "The plot of Ippatsu Jang! is very simple: the male hero knows about the tradition of playing strip mahjong; he swears he will master the game, and when he feels he has, he invites six most skilled (and gorgeous) young female mahjong players in the country to compete against him. The game is yet another variant of strip mahjong. The player can choose to compete against any of the six available girls in any order. Each mahjong match consists of several rounds. At the end of each round, should the player be victorious, the female opponents removes an item of her clothing. Successfully completed mahjong matches culminate in more sexually explicit images.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "July 12, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "May-Be Soft", "publishers": "May-Be Soft", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137326-ippatsu-jang\n"}
