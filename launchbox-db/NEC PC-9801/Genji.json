{"altername_name": [], "name": "Genji", "overview": "Main character is legendary Genji who searches for a killer. The first three games of Hot-B were original and left a really good impression. This material is much more difficult. This work is almost entirely stripped of eroticism which makes it even more difficult. Still, they really tried to spice things up. We find out the the criminal actually came from future to change history and we ride the time machine ourselves to get him. That's the twist worthy of Hot-B! Still the flow of the game is not even remotely good enough to fit for a masterpiece.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "July 1, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Hot-B", "publishers": "Hot-B", "genres": "Visual Novel", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/146513-genji\n"}
