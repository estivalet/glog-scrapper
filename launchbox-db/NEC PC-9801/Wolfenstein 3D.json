Your mission, as William \"B.J.\" Blazkowicz, is to steal the secret plans, make your escape and sabotage their evil plot. But captured in your attempt, you are hauled from Castle Hollehammer to the cells of Castle Wolfenstein - there to be questioned and await your certain execution. A lucky break gives you the chance to make your escape, only to find that Castle Wolfenstein is a maze of passages, bristling with trigger happy Nazi guards. Each level you break through brings you face to face with death. There's no time now to hold fire, it's kill or be killed . . .", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "November 18, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Infinity", "publishers": "Imagineer", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein_3D", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106157-wolfenstein-3d\n"}
