{"altername_name": ["Ch\u014d Jik\u016b Y\u014dsai Macross: Love Stories"], "name": "The Super Dimension Fortress Macross: Love Stories", "overview": "Based on the Macross anime, Ch\u014d Jik\u016b Y\u014dsai Macross: Love Stories is a direct sequel to Skull Leader; the game continues its story, as the humans on board the SDF-1 Macross continue to fight the Zentradi aliens under the command of Britai Kridanik. Visual style and gameplay system are nearly identical to those of the predecessor: the player deploys unit commanders on an isometric battle field and moves them in turn-based fashion, attacking enemies with mechs and space ships controlled by the commanders. The sequel features more different human commanders as well as new ship and mech types. The player can choose to play through the main campaign (which includes additional cutscenes and adventure-like menu-based exploration), or directly play any of the three available missions.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "July 29, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Family Soft", "publishers": "Family Soft", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/141936-the-super-dimension-fortress-macross-love-stories\n"}
