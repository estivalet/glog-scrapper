{"altername_name": [], "name": "Jankirou", "overview": "Jankir\u014d is an adult mahjong game. Only the four-player variant of the Chinese tile game is available. Player-controlled male protagonist can choose to travel through any of the three magical gates. Each gate contains five female mahjong opponents, from which the player must select three. The characters are united by themes: one gate leads to medieval characters and fantasy-themed creatures (a princess, a female elf, etc.); another contains exotic characters from past cultures or fetishes (including a woman wearing Nazi uniform); the last gate accommodates more regular young woman with specific biographies. Defeating any of these characters in mahjong leads to more revealing erotic images of them.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "February 25, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "FairyTale", "publishers": "FairyTale", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137372-jankirou\n"}
