{"altername_name": [], "name": "GaoGao! 3rd: Wild Force", "overview": "Wild Force is set in the same post-apocalyptic world as the previous entry in the GaoGao series. A virus turned most of the Earth's population into mutants, and human beings continued living in artificial cities, separated from the rest of the world. This time, the story is seen from the point of view of the mutants themselves (the previous GaoGao games had human protagonists). These look more like fairy tale creatures (half-cats, winged people, etc.), and continue living on the wild, dangerous Earth, keeping close to their respective animal tribes. The protagonist of the game is a young boy named Wolf, who belongs - you've guessed it - to the wolf tribe. One day, exploring the wilderness, he stumbles upon a strange cave with lurking monsters. Together with a girl from the rabbit tribe and other fantasy creatures, Wolf discovers an advanced civilization, learn of the existence of human beings, and eventually becomes a hero who saves the new world from a grave danger. Gameplay-wise, Wild Force is identical to the previous GaoGao games. The player chooses verb commands (\"Look\", \"Talk\", \"Ask\", \"Move\", etc.) to read text descriptions, advance the events, and be taken to the next location. As the other games in the series, this is an adult game with nudity and sexual situations - this time dedicated entirely to the \"animal girl fetish\".", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "October 29, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Four Nine", "publishers": "Four Nine", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137223-gaogao-3rd-wild-force\n"}
