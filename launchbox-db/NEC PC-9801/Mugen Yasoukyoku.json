{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mugen Yasoukyoku", "overview": "You are a college student named Shinichi Kashiwagi. One day, camping in a forest, you are caught in a terrible storm, become lost, and finally fall down unconscious. When you wake up, you find yourself in bed with an unknown woman. You realize that you are trapped in some sort of a strange mansion, which you cannot leave. Together with you there are several women. Your goal is now to find out more about those women, capture the heart of one of them, and find a way out of the mysterious mansion. Nocturnal Illusion is a Japanese-style adventure. Interaction is performed by selecting verb commands (Look, Talk, etc.) and occasionally objects from a menu. You can move around the mansion by using a mini-map. By doing so, you'll encounter various characters and trigger events. You'll be able to make decisions that will determine your relationships with the women. The game contains explicit sex scenes.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "April 21, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Apricot", "publishers": "Apricot", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/139595-mugen-yasoukyoku\n"}
