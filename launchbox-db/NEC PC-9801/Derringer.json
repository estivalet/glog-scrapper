{"altername_name": [], "name": "Derringer", "overview": "You're a private detective and you get a letter saying that 13-year old model Miki is restrained. The first work of Clest that sets an attempt to introduce idol Miki character that had to appear in the trilogy of the company. In this work Miki is 13, in the second work she's 19 and in the third work she should have been around 15, but third third work was never finished. So this work is not really long - we get to find Miki tied in the warehouse fairly fast. Still this work is notable since like in Lipstick ADV Miki is shown as a heroine with personality and not just an object of desire.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Clest", "publishers": "Clest", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/139876-derringer\n"}
