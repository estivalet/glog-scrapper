{"altername_name": [], "name": "Alaskan Malamute G.C.", "overview": "Alaskan malamute is actually a dog breed (similar to Siberian husky); but this game has nothing to do with dogs and everything to do with golf. The introduction story tells us that in 1912, the famous American businessman J.P.Morgan founded a golf tournament in Alaska. The best golfers from all over the world came to compete, but nobody from Japan... so naturally, the player has to correct that! Referring to itself as a \"3D simulation golf game\", Alaskan Malamute G.C. features pseudo-3D terrain with rotatable camera. The player is able to adjust his golfer's position, strength, direction, and style of the shot. It is possible to create own players with different statistics. The game has various play modes, with up to 4 players competing in each; those modes include regular play, tournament, and training.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "September 11, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Home Data", "publishers": "Home Data", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137034-alaskan-malamute-gc\n"}
