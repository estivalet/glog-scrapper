{"altername_name": [], "name": "Provvidenza: Legenda la Spada di Alfa", "overview": "The Kingdom of Faladia has been enjoying an era of peace and prosperity for a long while. However, it all came to an abrupt end when a neighboring country treacherously broke a peace agreement and attacked the capital city. The king asks an Alfa Knight named Romeo to escort his daughter to a safe passage, but war interrupts the gathering. Romeo finds himself in a coastal town, rescued by a nun named Maria, who agrees to accompany him on a quest to find the princess and fulfill the wishes of his sovereign. Provvidenza is a traditional Japanese-style role-playing game. Unlike other RPGs by Kinpukurin, it does not feature the trademark dialogue and party-recruiting system. Instead, it follows the simpler, more basic template, with plot-dictated companionship and automatized conversations. Enemies are superimposed on backgrounds, and combat is strictly round-based. Overworld and towns are shown from top-down view, but dungeons are navigated in a pseudo-3D first-person fashion (without an automap), similarly to Phantasy Star. Lights can be turned off and on, and traps detected and avoided during dungeon exploration.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "May 17, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Kinpukurin", "publishers": "Kinpukurin", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137531-provvidenza-legenda-la-spada-di-alfa\n"}
