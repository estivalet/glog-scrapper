{"altername_name": [], "name": "Amaranth KH", "overview": "Amaranth KH is a side-story in the Amaranth series, and can be considered a prequel to all the previous games; it doesn't feature the same heroes, but is set in the same universe, at a much earlier time, when the kingdom of Stellar was not yet built and when Posse was a flourishing city. The game tells the story of Landschaft, a young warrior in the army or Rauschritt. He trains in the Posse camp with his best friend Dienstag and the lovely Jungfer. He is well-known for his courage, but he first needs to prove himself worthy of being a true night. It began as an educational battle for the young hero, but soon a chain of events forced him to fight for his life and for his country. Amaranth KH is the radical conclusion to the series' tendency to strategy elements; it discards the RPG elements (movement outside of a battle screen, exploration, etc.) in favor of a traditional Japanese-style turn-based strategy game with a RPG angle (leveling up). The player commands Landschaft, his friends, and their units, moving them on the battle screen and attacking enemies when they are in their weapons' range. There are different types of units: infantry, cavalry, archers, magicians, etc. Some battle elements were taken from the previous game (such as archers attacking diagonally). Strong, story-related characters (generals) can fight alone against an entire unit of \"nameless\" characters. Every attack is displayed as a separate picture, graphically depicting ts results. If the attack is initiated by the enemy, the player can choose to counter-attack.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "April 21, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Fuga System", "publishers": "Fuga System", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/123363-amaranth-kh\n"}
