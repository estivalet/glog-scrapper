{"altername_name": ["Farland Story 3"], "name": "Farland Story: Tenshi no Namida", "overview": "\"Tenshi no Namida\" is a sequel to Farland Story Denki: Arc Ou no Ensei. One day the queen Ferio finds an unconscious young girl near the castle. The girl has lost her memory. In a terrible nightmare, she hears the voice of a demon lord, calling her \"Fana\". Beside this name, she cannot remember anything. Ferio asks her husband, the king Arc, to take Fana to a nearby city and to visit the archbishop, who might know more about Fana's past. The two are unaware of the grave dangers which await them because of this decision... The third in the row of Farland Story games, \"Tenshi no Namida\" looks and plays very similarly to the first two games. You navigate your party over the world map in turn-based fashion. After you have assigned commands to your party members, it is the enemies' turn. You can attack physically when enemies are in range of your weapon, or cast spells - each character in your party belongs to a certain class and specializes in different type of combat. You gain experience points directly from hitting an enemy, even while counter-attacking, and can therefore level up in the middle of a battle.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "July 15, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Technical Group Laboratory", "publishers": "Technical Group Laboratory", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/125462-farland-story-tenshi-no-namida\n"}
