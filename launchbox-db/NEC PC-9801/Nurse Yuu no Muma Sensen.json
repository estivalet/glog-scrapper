{"altername_name": ["Nurse no Mumasensen"], "name": "Nurse Yuu no Muma Sensen", "overview": "Nurse Y\u016b no Mumasensen is an adventure game with a rather cryptic story. The player controls a young nurse named Y\u016b, who finds herself near a secluded military hospital, unable to understand whether she is dreaming or not. She then begins to work at the hospital, becoming more and more intrigued by the events happening in it. Most of the game is dedicated to selecting locations (hospital rooms) from a map. Repeatedly visiting all the locations eventually triggers events that advance the plot. There is also an icon-based interface with verb commands; however, it is very rudimentary, as there is no possibility to interact with specific objects.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "September 4, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Wendy Magazine", "publishers": "Wendy Magazine", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137499-nurse-yuu-no-muma-sensen\n"}
