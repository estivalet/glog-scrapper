{"altername_name": [], "name": "Oerstedia", "overview": "Long time ago, the king god Reg and the evil god Barbados fought each other in a titanic battle. But only thanks to combined efforts of magicians and a hero named Oersted, Barbados was defeated and sealed for centuries. Now, an evil cult is trying to resurrect Barbados. But in order to do this, they have to sacrifice a descendant of Oersted, and this happens to be the lovely Oerstedia, queen of Broshan. Before long the queen is kidnapped. The king sends for the bravest heroes in the country, and four of them have answered... Oerstedia is an action RPG. Most of the game time is spent in top-down maze-like dungeons, where the player character fights enemies in action-style combat. Characters gain experience and get stronger. They can also find weapons and armor scattered around the dungeons. It is possible to play as either of the four heroes: a lizardman, a human, a female half-elf, and a dwarf. These characters have different parameters, but their gameplay style is similar (melee combat), and they have to go through the same locations and events. Oerstedia also offers a two-player mode. The players can choose two of the available four characters for co-operative dungeon exploring and monster-fighting.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "August 6, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Fuga System", "publishers": "Fuga System", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137500-oerstedia\n"}
