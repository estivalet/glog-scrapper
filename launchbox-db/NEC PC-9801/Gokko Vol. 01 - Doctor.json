{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gokko Vol. 01: Doctor", "overview": "The story of Gokko Vol. 01: Doctor is quite simple: the protagonist is a young man who dreams of becoming a great doctor, study abroad, and win the Nobel prize. In reality, however, he is just an ordinary aspiring physician who has to practice his medical skills in a Japanese hospital. However, seeing how all the doctors, nurses, and patients turn out to be gorgeous young women, the hero quickly forgets the Hippocratic oath in favor of his less altruist, but more basic instincts... The gameplay offers very little interaction and mostly involves choosing between a few dialogues lines and actions (always context-specific, without a permanent interaction menu) to advance the events. Most of the choices are purely cosmetic, though a few might lead to Game Over.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "July 14, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mink", "publishers": "Mink", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137235-gokko-vol-01-doctor\n"}
