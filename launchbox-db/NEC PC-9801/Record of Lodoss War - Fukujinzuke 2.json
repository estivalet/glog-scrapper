{"altername_name": ["Lodoss Tou Senki: Fukujindzuke 2"], "name": "Record of Lodoss War: Fukujinzuke 2", "overview": "The follow-up to Fukujinzuke is a more elaborate supplement to Humming Bird's Record of Lodoss War computer RPG series and can be considered a mini-RPG. The game introduces six new pre-made characters in various races and classes. The player can choose to either export these characters to Record of Lodoss War II: Goshiki no Mary\u016b, or import player-created characters from there. The player then builds a party out of any of these characters to go through either of the two modes: a series of battles in different locations and an exploration of a pseudo-3D third-person dungeon. The first mode allows shopping, resting, and healing in a generic town before engaging in combat; the second mode allows only a two-character party and awards items and equipment as rewards for guessing correctly what type of monsters ambushes the heroes in specific rooms.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "August 8, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Humming Bird Soft", "publishers": "Humming Bird Soft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133774-record-of-lodoss-war-fukujinzuke-2\n"}
