{"altername_name": [], "name": "Nightmare Collection II: Marine Philt", "overview": "In the first half of the 21st century, humanity started building space satellites, trying to sustain the working conditions in outer space by using a drug known as Marine Philt. Eventually the project was abandoned. One of the deserted satellites fell onto the Earth, causing a radioactive accident that forced the inhabitants of Neo Tokyo to dwell underground. One day, a young man named Seed heard a news report about a gruesome murder that occurred in a research facility. Together with his friends, Seed ventures into the building, only to discover another horrifying result of the satellite crash, which may put the entire city in immense danger. Marine Philt is a horror-themed Japanese-style adventure. The player interacts with the environment in a point-and-click fashion, selecting verb commands (\"Look\", \"Talk\", \"Use\", etc.) and applying them to objects on the screen. There are no puzzles and only a very limited amount of inventory manipulation. A few sequences are action-based, requiring the player to act quickly in a dangerous situation.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "March 12, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "FairyTale", "publishers": "FairyTale", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137493-nightmare-collection-ii-marine-philt\n"}
