{"altername_name": ["Anniversary: Memories of Summer Vacation"], "name": "Anniversary: Natsuyasumi no Omoide", "overview": "Anniversary: Memories of Summer Vacation tells the story of a young girl named Ringo. One night, Ringo witnesses an impish girl named Cherry seducing another girl. At first she feels repulsed, but after a while finds out that she is excited... soon she and Cherry become lovers and soulmates, unaware of the fact that Cherry is being hunted by the authorities... The game is a traditional Japanese-style adventure (without puzzles). Interaction with the game world is performed by selected verb commands (Look, Talk, Think, Move, etc.), from a menu. Selecting a command leads to context-related sub-menus. Sex scenes are handled somewhat differently; also with verb commands, but rather concrete ones (Touch, Lick, etc.), and point-and-click interaction instead of sub-menus.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "December 3, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Janis", "publishers": "Janis", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137039-anniversary-natsuyasumi-no-omoide\n"}
