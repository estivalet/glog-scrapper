He is asked to bodyguard Shiori, but Shiori gets raped and kidnapped on his eyes. He swears to avenge her and punish the offenders. New Ides brand company to specialize on \"oppai\" so minori competitor here! Dark suspense work with probably the first to feature NTR. Quite a thrilling work up to the middle when you just pull the trigger and - bam - culprit is dead. Easy as that. So not really a good work, but definitely a memorable one.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "September 28, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "FMC", "publishers": "IDES", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/139952-bay-city-elegy\n"}
