{"altername_name": [], "name": "Kyarukan: Super Break Down!!", "overview": "Kyarukan: Super Break Down!! is a simple tile-matching puzzle game with an erotic theme. The player is presented with a grid of tiles containing hidden pictures; the goal is to match identically-looking pairs in as few moves as possible, until all the tiles are revealed and the stage is completed. The player is given a certain amount of lives, which can be increased by revealing special tiles (pictures of a girl's face or the words \"life\"), or reduced by hitting a tile with a wolf on it. Other tiles that can't be matched include \"open\" (reveals all the tiles for a brief moment) and \"shuffle\" (changes the location of the pictures). Once a stage is completed, the player is presented with an anime-style picture of a young woman. The stages become increasingly complex, with bigger grids and more tile types; the girl gradually removes her clothes after each stage. There are three \"scenarios\" in the game, with three different girls; however, the gameplay remains identical in all of them.", "platform": "NEC PC-9801", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "ToyPops", "publishers": "ToyPops", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/146931-kyarukan-super-break-down\n"}
