There are a total of 15 stages, with the progress being kept after completing five stages via the cartridge's EEPROM but high-scores and other settings are not saved. There are also three difficulty levels, however, the game's special edition has a set difficulty and finishing the game unlocks an expert difficulty that can be activated by holding Option on the controller before starting a level. It also features support for the ProController.", "platform": "Atari Jaguar", "release_date": "December 20, 1999", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bethesda Softworks", "publishers": "Songbird Productions", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVgvpDHUv1E", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/115259"}
