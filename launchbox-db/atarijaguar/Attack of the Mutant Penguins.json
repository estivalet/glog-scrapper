{"name": "Attack of the Mutant Penguins", "overview": "In the distant galaxy of Bleurggh, an evil (but reasonably stupid) band of aliens picked up some of Earth's television signals. Unfortunately for them, they could only tune in a wildlife program. They figured the Earth would be a pushover to invade, so they disguised themselves as its inhabitants -- penguins! Word of the invasion has reached those champions of intergalactic do-goodery, Bernard and Rodney. Now, with their help, you must prevent the alien mutant penguins from triggering the Doomscale and destroying the Earth. Are you up to the challenge?", "platform": "Atari Jaguar", "release_date": "March 1, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Sunrise Games", "publishers": "Atari", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.18", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlxYoxm_kuU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/9475"}
