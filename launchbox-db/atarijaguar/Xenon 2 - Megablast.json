{"name": "Xenon 2 - Megablast", "overview": "Xenon 2: Megablast is a vertically scrolling space shooter, in which you have to pass several levels, filled with waves of enemies, that all end with a level boss creature. Each group of enemies you destroy grants you a cash reward and every once in a while you enter Colin's Bargain Basement, where you can use this cash to purchase upgrades for your ship like better weapons, speed & health upgrades etc. Some upgrades can also be picked up during the levels.<br><br>The first part of the game has an organic feel to it, while the second part of the game features mechanical enemies. As there are some maze-like sections with dead-ends in the game, your spaceship scrolls backwards when you keep pressing the down key.", "platform": "Atari Jaguar", "release_date": "May 27, 2016", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "The Bitmap Brothers", "publishers": "AtariAge", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEgwZlHdlbk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/140530"}
