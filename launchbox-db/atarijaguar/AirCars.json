{"name": "AirCars", "overview": "Designed by Midnight Entertainment Group in 1995, ICD released AirCars in limited numbers. No real box was made (it came shrinkwrapped inside a box insert), but the cartridge included a label and manual, along with a picture of what the overlay might look like. This is an action/battle game in which you must destroy enemy bases while in your Air Car, and it supports up to 8 players using CatBoxes or 2 players using a JagLink. Although better graphics can be found on the Jaguar and control is a bit sluggish, linking 8 players using CatBoxes can be a unique experience. The hard part will be finding those extra CatBoxes and copies of AirCars.", "platform": "Atari Jaguar", "release_date": "May 27, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "MidNite Entertainment", "publishers": "ICD", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.79", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaOjwss7Pqs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21714"}
