{"altername_name": [], "name": "Wiz", "overview": "Enter the realms of magic and lead Wiz the last elder wizard on a quest to find the Magic Lantern. Using your trusty book of magic and spell potions, you must traverse many hazardous paths to finally restore light to where dark magic has prevailed. Wiz \u2013 Quest For The Magic Lantern is a typical Platforming type of game with a few minor puzzles and such to make it interesting for most people out there, the difficulty is very different to older Mutation Software games for the Amiga thanks to better game design and clearer goals(?) but there will be times that you will want to scream for sure. But, don\u2019t worry as there is even an option to make it easier by adding more lives (5) and potions (3) which helps a lot for most parts of the game, yes I know that there is such an option in Tin Toy too and that was still hard after adding more lives but no need to worry, this is a game for all ages. The game also got a continue system which will let you continue from the world you got before you lost all your lives which is sure to make many casual gamers happy.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga CD32", "release_date": "2020", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mutation Software", "publishers": "Mutation Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/368215-wiz\n"}
