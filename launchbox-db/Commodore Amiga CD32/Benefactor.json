{"altername_name": [], "name": "Benefactor", "overview": "As Ben E. Factor himself, you must travel through the six moons of Minniat, on which the peaceful and good-natured people of Lullyat have been kidnapped. These Merry Men each have their own potential skill once rescued, so releasing them in the right order is often essential for completing a level. Some Merry Men have grey suits - this marks them out as joyless and awkward characters which must be guided through a coloring machine. The Miniation people have loaded the 60 levels with various nasties, ranging from slugs (slow, but must be jumped), Rock Men (those with sharp backs are more dangerous, but both are quite nippy), spiked teeth emerging from manholes, and so on. A large map is provided, and at any point you can pause the game and scroll around the map, which makes the forward planning easier.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga CD32", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Digital Illusions", "publishers": "Psygnosis", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.6", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benefactor_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEUoFCuM-i4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40442-benefactor\n"}
