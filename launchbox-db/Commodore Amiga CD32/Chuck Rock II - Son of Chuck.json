{"altername_name": [], "name": "Chuck Rock II: Son of Chuck", "overview": "The story in this Chuck Rock game takes up a little while after the end of the first game. As you may remember, Chuck Rock had to rescue his girl, Ophelia from the bad dude Gary Gritter. Well, he was successful in his efforts, and now Chuck and Ophelia are married. Eventually, they have a son, named Junior. Chuck works in a factory, where he develops great skill at carving automobiles out of stone. A rival manufacturer becomes jealous of Chuck's abilities and kidnaps him. Now it is up to Junior to rescue his dad! The gameplay in this sequel is similar to the first game, but with some minor differences since you are playing as Junior, rather than Chuck. This is a side-scrolling platform game with occasional rock-moving puzzles thrown in. Unlike Chuck, Junior carries a club that gives his attacks further reach.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga CD32", "release_date": "September 15, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Core Design", "publishers": "Core Design", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.21", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Rock_II:_Son_of_Chuck", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRRwJMpr450", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/16387-chuck-rock-ii-son-of-chuck\n"}
