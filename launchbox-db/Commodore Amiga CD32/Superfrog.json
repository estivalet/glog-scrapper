{"altername_name": [], "name": "Superfrog", "overview": "Superfrog is a scrolling 2D platform game. You play an unnamed prince who is turned into a frog by a jealous witch, who then abducts his princess girlfriend. Subsequently sulking by the \"River O' Despair\", the prince chances upon a floating bottle of Lucozade which confers upon him super powers. The objective of the game is to find and defeat the witch, thus rescuing your princess, whilst achieving smaller objectives throughout the game, such as finding a golden key or escaping from captivity in a circus. There are 24 regular levels, divided into six differently-themed worlds. The goal of each level is to collect a set number of coins, and then reach the exit, which will only open if Superfrog has collected enough coins. Extra factors of gameplay include a timer countdown and a number of health points, both of which can be restored by finding bottles of Lucozade among the levels. Depending on the number of coins and fruit collected, and on how fast the player finishes the level, a number of credits (up to a maximum of 15) are awarded at the end of each level. The player can then choose to either collect the credits for a score or gamble them in a slot machine-style minigame for more bonuses. The most important function of the slot machine minigame is the chance to win a level code, enabling the player to restart the game from the beginning of the next level at a later time.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga CD32", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Team 17", "publishers": "Team 17", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.65", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superfrog", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Lqu7jlbccI&gl=BE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75464-superfrog\n"}
