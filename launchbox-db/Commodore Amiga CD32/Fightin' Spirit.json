{"altername_name": [], "name": "Fightin' Spirit", "overview": "Fightin' Spirit is a one-on-one beat 'em up centred around a competition by a gang overlord to find new heavies for his organisation. Ten tough-nuts have come forward, such as Burke the squaddie and Eric the biker. Many of these have special moves in which they can turn into an animal - Tong Lee can become a tiger and Lorente a puma. Special moves are selected using a combination of joystick/pad movements followed by a tap of fire. The game can be played with or without blood, and in a turbo speed mode, with tournament and tag-team options for potential multi-player tournaments. The game supports CD32 controllers as well as one-button joysticks.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga CD32", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Light Shock", "publishers": "neo", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/82158-fightin-spirit\n"}
