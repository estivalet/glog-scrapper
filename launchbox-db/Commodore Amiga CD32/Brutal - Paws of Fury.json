{"altername_name": [], "name": "Brutal: Paws of Fury", "overview": "The Dalai Llama has organised a martial arts contest for animals of all species to prove their skills, and you are competing in it. There are a wide variety of furry creatures to take on, and finally the Dalai Llama himself. Brutal: Paws of Fury is a one-on-one fighting game across a variety of levels, with mostly outdoor terrain. You can choose of the many characters. Throughout the game, your character travels across Dalai Llama's island, fighting a series of duels before getting to the final showdown. During a duel, you can punch and kick your opponent, try to use special attacks on him/her, or use a \"taunt\" that restores a bit of your health. Each battle lasts a number of rounds (how many - that is determined in the options menu); once one combatant has won that number of times during the battle, he wins. If the computer-controlled player won, it's game over (but you can still use a continue to start the fight anew); if you won, you move on to the next opponent. Once you have defeated them, you can watch an ending animation, different depending on the character you have chosen.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga CD32", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Software Sorcery", "publishers": "GameTek UK", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0W0znAqjoQ&ab_channel=OldGamesDatabase", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72536-brutal-paws-of-fury\n"}
