{"altername_name": [], "name": "Supercars II AGA", "overview": "The follow up to Magnetic Fields' earlier racing game develops the format in several ways. As before, the racing is overhead view and against a field of 9 computer cars, with championship points awarded for finishing positions. The computer drivers now take on the humourous names from Lotus 1, such as 'Ayrton Sendup' and 'T Hairy Bootson'. The most noticeable addition is a split screen 2 player mode. A reboot of Supercars 2 by Magnetic Fields using AGA graphics - 256 color screens from Supercars 3 international - colored enemy cars instead of gray ones (128 colors displayed on screen) - based on original Shaun Southern source code - optional in-game music (choice between sfx only, J.M.D tunes, Lotus tunes) - joypad controls", "platform": "Commodore Amiga CD32", "release_date": "March 14, 2023", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "jotd666", "publishers": "", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1Tg8C0PFQk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/368301-supercars-ii-aga\n"}
