{"altername_name": [], "name": "Super Stardust", "overview": "Like Stardust, in this Asteroids clone you control your Panther PX-2 ship through successive waves of asteroids and other enemies, which are drawn using ray-tracing techniques. The game features both overhead and 3D sections. In the overhead part, you must eliminate enemy ships and asteroids across several zones in each world. The 3D sections consist of underwater tunnels that link one world to another and they are each defended by a guardian you must defeat.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga CD32", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Bloodhouse", "publishers": "Team 17", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Stardust", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1XgdvvWpUM&ab_channel=OldGamesDatabase", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83266-super-stardust\n"}
