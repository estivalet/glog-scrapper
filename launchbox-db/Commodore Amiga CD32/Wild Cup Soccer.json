{"altername_name": [], "name": "Wild Cup Soccer", "overview": "Following on from Brutal Sports Football came this interpretation of soccer, released alongside the 1994 World Cup. In one player mode you can play a Wild Cup or a League system; two player games are restricted to single \u2018Unfriendly\u2019 matches. Unlike its predecessor the game uses an isometric viewpoint, perhaps because the original FIFA was so popular at the time. A number of vicious moves are on offer, with tackles Vinnie Jones would flinch at along with lethal head-butts and shoulder barges. If a game finishes drawn, it goes into a \u2018Penalty Shoot Out\u2019, which involves going round shooting the opposition;\u2013 the last team standing wins. The pre-match screens include attacking at defensive play styles, transfers and the chance to buy items such as rocket launchers and shields.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga CD32", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Teque London", "publishers": "Millennium Interactive", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwDBI8cukXU&ab_channel=OldGamesDatabase", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/88069-wild-cup-soccer\n"}
