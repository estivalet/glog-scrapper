{"altername_name": [], "name": "Wembley International Soccer", "overview": "Officially licensed by the old Wembley stadium, this football game is essentially an advanced version of Ocean's European Champions. Gameplay emphasizes one-touch passing, with a picture-in-picture window displayed when you prepare to play a long pass, which increases you chances of finding the target player. The AGA version was the first floppy-based game to supports a CD32 controller, making it easier to execute moves. 64 international teams are included, with the chance to play a full league competition or a World Cup. Full control over formation and tactics is offered before the match.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga CD32", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Audiogenic Software", "publishers": "Audiogenic Software", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUBDvhM2_fU&ab_channel=FunCade64", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/88066-wembley-international-soccer\n"}
