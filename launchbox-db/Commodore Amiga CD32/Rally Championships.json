{"altername_name": [], "name": "Rally Championships", "overview": "Rally Championship is a decent rally racing sim from Inside Team, published by Flair in 1994. The game's strengths lie more in the excellent choice of cars and racing locales than actual car physics. The goal is simple: race in courses around the world for prize money, which you can use to buy more pricey cars. The cars you can drive are all top-of-the-line, including the Porsche RS, Peugot 205 Rally, Opel Calibra, Lancia Delta, Ford Escort Turbo, and the Toyota Celica. Rally courses range from snowy Scandinavia to the dusty East African savanna, bustling city streets of France, lush tropical rainforests, and even very narrow passes on the Alps.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga CD32", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "InSide Team", "publishers": "Flair Software", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72896-rally-championships\n"}
