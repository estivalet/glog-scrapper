{"altername_name": [], "name": "Myth: History in the Making", "overview": "In this game, you are a mere mortal who has been called by the Gods to defeat several mythological creatures that have been turned bad by the evil Dameron. Myth: History in the Making is a platform game with a lot of fighting. The levels of this game deal with different mythologies, from ancient Greece to the Vikings, over to Valhalla (where none other than the hammer-wielding Thor awaits you), and more. Apart from jumping from platform to platform, you'll also fight the enemies and bosses in your path with a variety of weapons - in the beginning you have only fists to defend yourself, but later you'll find more powerful weapons, such as swords and axes. There are many various types of enemies, different on every level. Typically, enemies keep appearing and coming at you from all sides, no matter how many of them you kill - so you have to keep moving.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga CD32", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "System 3", "publishers": "System 3", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.61", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myth:_History_in_the_Making", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/9839-myth-history-in-the-making\n"}
