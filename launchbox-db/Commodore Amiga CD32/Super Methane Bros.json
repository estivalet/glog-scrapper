{"altername_name": [], "name": "Super Methane Bros", "overview": "Super Methane Brothers is a 1993 platform arcade game released for Amiga by Apache Software Ltd.. The gameplay is similar to Taito's Bubble Bobble. Puff and Blow each have a Methane Gas Gun which fires a cloud of immobilising gas. If this comes into contact with a bad guy he will be absorbed into the gas and then float around the screen for a limited time. Bad guys are harmless in this state. Puff and Blow must suck the floating gas clouds into their guns and blast them out against a vertical surface. Bad guys then turn into bonuses which can be collected.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga CD32", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Apache Software", "publishers": "Apache Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/9917-super-methane-bros\n"}
