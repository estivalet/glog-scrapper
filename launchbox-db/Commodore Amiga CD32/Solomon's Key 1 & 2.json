{"altername_name": [], "name": "Solomon's Key 1 & 2", "overview": "A brand new double release for the Amiga CD32 in the form of Solomon's Key 1 and 2. In regards to Solomon's Key 2, this is a puzzle platformer from the early 90's and you play as Dana while tasked with extinguishing all the fires in a level to proceed to the next. Similar in style to other block moving games, you can create your own ice or by kicking ice onto the fires. Solomon's Key is a platform game with both action and strategy elements. On each level your goal is to retrieve a key which can then be used to unlock the exit. To help out, you have a magic wand which can be used to create and destroy blocks (though some blocks can't be destroyed). In order to reach the key you will need carefully to arrange the blocks on the screen so you can jump your way around safely. Wandering around each level are a variety of enemies which will cause you to lose a life if you're caught. Some creatures can be killed by destroying the block they are standing on, others must be dodged. Hidden bonuses and magic can be found on many of the levels, sometimes even hidden in blocks. Some treasures give you bonus points, others can form magic spells to help deal with the enemies. To make the game more difficult, each level has a time limit in which it must be completed.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga CD32", "release_date": "May 12, 2015", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Cobe", "publishers": "", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/368637-solomons-key-1-2\n"}
