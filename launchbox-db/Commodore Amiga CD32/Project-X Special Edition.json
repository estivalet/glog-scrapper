{"altername_name": [], "name": "Project-X Special Edition", "overview": "Fasten your seatbelt, this one is going to be a rough ride. This is a shoot-em-up's shoot-em-up, a blast from the past (1992 actually). You are a rider at the gates of space, flying your craft like the wind. Sad things are happening on the planet Ryxx, with evil creatures wanting to do naughty deeds. And guess what, you are the only one who can stop them. The action comes thick and fast. There are loads of power-ups to boost your progress and these include extra speed, missiles, plasma, lasers and stealth. The latter makes you virtually invincible, though if you add too many weapons your ship ran become sluggish so it's important to keep collecting the speed. This version has been tweaked slightly and has been reduced from four disks to three. Plus there's now a Rookie mode that enables novices to get to later levels. Make no mistake, Project-X Special Edition is a great shoot-em-up, download it now.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga CD32", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Team 17", "publishers": "Team 17", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/153965-project-x-special-edition\n"}
