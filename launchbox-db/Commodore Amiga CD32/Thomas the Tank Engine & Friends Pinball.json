{"altername_name": ["Thomas the Tank Enbgine's Pinball"], "name": "Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends Pinball", "overview": "I have got a problem with computer pinball games. Football, golf, cricket and darts. I have played and enjoyed on the Amiga \u2013 but pinball? Nah. If you have got a pound in your pocket and are in the centre of a large town, you will be surrounded by all manner of real silver ball opportunities in arcades and pubs. Now I will readily admit that if you are three years old (Thomas is aimed at age three upwards), you are unlikely to find yourself with a pound in your pocket in the centre of a large town with time to kill. If you do, you are lost, or your parents have abandoned you. Find a policeman immediately. There are four tables (Thomas, Percy, James and Toby), multi-player options and it all works reasonably well \u2013 the ball rolls towards the flippers, you hit it and it bounces around the table until it goes out. Some of the shots are very difficult, and some are virtually impossible, but that is not different to other 'adult' tables. It all scrolls reasonably well, it is bright and colourful (kids are bound to like it) and, well, it is a perfectly functional kids' pinball game. Buy it if you want a reasonable kids' pinball game for your Amiga. However, there is an alternative. Have you thought about investing in a sturdy box or crate? If you do, you can visit your local, child-friendly pub, put \u00a31 in the pinball machine, place the child on the sturdy box or crate facing the table, repair to the bar and leave your offspring playing the real thing and annoying everyone within a 10-yard radius.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga CD32", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Spidersoft", "publishers": "Alternative Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "8", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/88063-thomas-the-tank-engine-friends-pinball\n"}
