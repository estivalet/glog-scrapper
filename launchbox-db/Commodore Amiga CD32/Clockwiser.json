{"altername_name": [], "name": "Clockwiser", "overview": "On each of Clockwiser's levels, you are presented with a level layout, and a target layout, with the aim being to transform the former to match the target. The levels consist of a collection of cogs, which can be rotated either clockwise or anti-clockwise to achieve this goal. There are lots of special blocks to help out, including bombs, diamond-producers and anti-gravity blocks. Each level has its own time limit, ranging from seconds to minutes - this doesn't start until you make your first move, and you can look around the level at your leisure before making a stab at it. Each level has its own password, which makes progression a little easier.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga CD32", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Team Hoi", "publishers": "Rasputin Software", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clockwiser", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c57RElcEuec", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72679-clockwiser\n"}
