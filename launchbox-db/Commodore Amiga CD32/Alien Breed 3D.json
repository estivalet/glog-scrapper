{"altername_name": [], "name": "Alien Breed 3D", "overview": "Alien Breed 3D is a follow-up to Alien Breed, a Gauntlet-style shooter, and its sequels. Unlike its predecessors, this game is set into a 3D context, making for the Amiga's first big Doom-style game. The 3D engine uses fairly small screen graphics, but these include full floors and ceilings with detailed shading, doors, vertical position variations, lifts and transporters. The CD version includes extra atmospheric sound, while fast processors and extra FastRAM are also supported.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga CD32", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Team17 Software", "publishers": "Ocean Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.08", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_Breed_3D", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZARnYNg_sU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40399-alien-breed-3d\n"}
