{"altername_name": [], "name": "Road Avenger", "overview": "Road Avenger is a badass LaserDisc classic and it's here for the first time for all Amiga machines! Engage in a relentless, vengeful car chase against RRR thugs, in order to wipe them off the highway and take your sweet revenge for the murder of your beloved wife! Players assume the role of an angry cop on a wild ride as he pursues a gang of bikers who killed his wife. Players need to race through oncoming traffic, squeeze between trucks, trash motorcycles and steer through lots of explosions. The only thing needed are quick reflexes to follow the instructions on the screen (with an increasing difficulty) in order to keep the animation going. The action is shown from a first-person view and fast-paced, while still maintaining smooth and detailed anime drawn graphics.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga CD32", "release_date": "2018", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Data East", "publishers": "Reimagine Games", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90kKXcannIo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165581-road-avenger\n"}
