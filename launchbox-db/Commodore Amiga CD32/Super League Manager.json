{"altername_name": [], "name": "Super League Manager", "overview": "This football management game is unique for two main reasons. Firstly, it's set in a completely fictitious game-world, with fantasy teams and players. You start off managing Folkford United, the worst team in the country, with players including Brian Evans, Nicky Moody and Bruce Roberts, and rival teams include Oldcastle, Marwick and Stoke Berry. The second difference is the lack of statistics for player details. Instead, sentences such as 'best in defence, can also play in midfield. Has been playing reasonably well. Signed for \u00a3100,000 from Oldcastle 2 years ago. Current value around \u00a3150,000' are used, and its through playing matches and noting player ratings that you interpret how good a defender he is. Another break with convention is an attempt at a human side, with players and fans communicating with you, offering advice, praise or semi-literate criticism. The training feature is more complex than usual, requiring you to select 3 activities (from a selection such as passing, gym work and lap running) for each player each week - players will complain if they feel your selections are boring or unhelpful. If you own either Emlyn Hughes' International Soccer (for the standard versions) or Wembley International Soccer (for the Amiga 1200 version) you can play around 1 match in 6, and watch all the others - otherwise you simply see a progressive score update, and can intervene with substitutions or tactical changes.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga CD32", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Audiogenic Software", "publishers": "Audiogenic Software", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.88", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nMtqOYNuXY&ab_channel=OldGamesDatabase", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/88062-super-league-manager\n"}
