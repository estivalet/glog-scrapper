{"altername_name": [], "name": "Summer Olympix", "overview": "This has a more humorous approach then most other games of this type, the characters and graphics have a lot of cartoon feeling. There are 8 different events to compete in. Some are really easy if you fast on the buttons, like Swimming and 100 meter sprint. But others like Long jump, Javelin and Archery needs more technique then hammering on the buttons. Also there is Skeet shooting, Boxing and Kayak events.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga CD32", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Flair Software", "publishers": "Flair Software", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/88056-summer-olympix\n"}
