{"altername_name": [], "name": "Fire Force", "overview": "A side-scrolling action arcade game similar to Green Beret. You play a mercenary who is dropped behind enemy lines. You need to make your way to the end each level where a helicopter awaits. The game is set in a Middle Eastern and Vietnam environment. There are several missions each is different and objectives are randomly changing (so it's fun to play more than once). There is time limit for each mission so hurry up.You can use guns, grenades and a knife. Slashing throats of your enemies or letting it rip with AK, it's up to you how you approach it. Watch enemies fly when they got hit by grenades. Nice feature to able to pick up dead enemies equipment. A lot of Rambo action!", "platform": "Commodore Amiga CD32", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "International Computer Entertainment", "publishers": "International Computer Entertainment", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.38", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxW8rjHHjpc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/43503-fire-force\n"}
