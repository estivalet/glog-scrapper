{"altername_name": ["Fire & Ice"], "name": "Fire & Ice: The Daring Adventures of Cool Coyote", "overview": "The background story of Fire & Ice is quick to tell: A coyote (you) runs, throwing ice cubes, through various worlds. In the levels you must jump on platforms and kill your enemies. The enemies (for example, birds and penguins) can be shot with your ice cubes; they become frozen, so you smash them. Sometimes they leave part of a key behind after they're destroyed. The complete key, assembled from all the pieces, opens the door to the next world.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga CD32", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Graftgold", "publishers": "Renegade Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.96", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_and_Ice_(video_game)", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl9wG-RUdLs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/9811-fire-ice-the-daring-adventures-of-cool-coyote\n"}
