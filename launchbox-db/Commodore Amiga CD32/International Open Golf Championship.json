{"altername_name": [], "name": "International Open Golf Championship", "overview": "Well I don\u2019t know what it is but it sure ain\u2019t golf. Believe me, I know. I play golf and this isn\u2019t it. This is some kind of bizarre cross between Operation Wolf and the polygon generator in Dpaint with golfing paraphernalia tossed in. I don\u2019t really want to go into gross detail about the elements of International Open Golf as it\u2019s already depressed me beyond belief and I wouldn\u2019t wish the same fate upon you. Briefly though, have a look at the following example. I\u2019m 50 yards away from the green. The ideal club is a Sand Wedge. Unfortunately due to the strange control method of only being able to take full power, half power, three-quarter power or one-quarter power shots (with nothing in between), the only way I can actually take a 50 yard shot is to change to a Number 2 iron and take a quarter shot. About as realistic as England\u2019s chances of qualifying for the World Cup (wrong sport I know, but I feel strongly about both). International Open Golf is simply a failed attempt to do something different with the golfing concept. All credit to Ocean for trying but let\u2019s face it, it was a doomed effort from the start. There\u2019s only one way you stand a chance of bettering PGA Tour Golf and that\u2019s to call your game MicroProse Golf (and I\u2019ll bet that\u2019s angered a few of you PGA purists out there).", "platform": "Commodore Amiga CD32", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "RISC", "publishers": "Ocean Software Ltd.", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2Z9CVwvxnM&ab_channel=OldGamesDatabase", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/88006-international-open-golf-championship\n"}
