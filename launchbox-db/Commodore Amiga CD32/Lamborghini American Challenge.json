The races are divided into three leagues, each one with increasingly harder opponents, and the player needs to regularly upgrade their Lamborghini Diablo in order to keep them above the other racers, by using the american currency from bets as well as the bonuses earned by succeeding in the races in first place.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga CD32", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Titus", "publishers": "Titus Interactive", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.33", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamborghini_American_Challenge", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkhHhJtOpiU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/42919-lamborghini-american-challenge\n"}
