{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gulp!", "overview": "Gulp! is a Puzzle game, developed and published by I.C.E., which was released in Europe in 1994. Gulp! is ICE\u2019s first release since the rather ill-fated Total Carnage, and it s nice to see that it\u2019s actually a reasonably good game. As you can probably tell from the screenshots, it\u2019 got an awful lot to do with fish. To capture the essence of Gulp! in a nutshell, it\u2019s Lemmings underwater, but with much more interaction with the background. The aim of each level is to get a certain number of fish from the inlet pipe to the exit, while avoiding everything if possible. The levels are large, and fairly intricately laid out. Most people will find Gulp! incredibly hard to play for the first hour or two, simply because there is so much to watch out for, and so much going on at once. Thankfully, you are able to pause the game and scroll around the map, so you shouldn\u2019t find it too much trouble planning your route; it\u2019s just the execution that\u2019s the hard part. Gulp! isn\u2019t a bad game at all. Although it sometimes can get very confused on screen, there are some really nice ideas in there. It won\u2019t hook everyone In fact. I don\u2019t even think it will hook everyone who liked Lemmings. You\u2019ll either love it with a passion, or you\u2019ll play it once and never look at it again. It\u2019s a time-honoured statement, but I think with this one you\u2019re really going to have to try before you buy.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga CD32", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "I.C.E.", "publishers": "I.C.E.", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYC0WR-UcNA&ab_channel=OldGamesDatabase", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/88003-gulp\n"}
