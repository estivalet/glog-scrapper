{"altername_name": [], "name": "Shadow of the Beast Trilogy", "overview": "The Shadow of the Beast are side-scrolling platformers with a side-shooter elements (by the end). The player has to navigate through several areas filled with enemies and traps, collecting keys and activating triggers that open new areas or give Aarbron the means to overcome a sub-boss. The number of moves the player has at disposal is limited: duck, jump and only two attacks: punch and a flying kick. While most enemies die with just one hit, the player must time each attack accurately. However, there are also traps of objects that cannot be destroyed and these require the player to jump, duck or move according the sequence. The player has only one life with 12 hit points that can be replenished by collecting some objects hidden in the level (like an off-route location or a under a megalith), which also contributes to the difficulty level. Includes Shadow of the Beast, Shadow of the Beast II, and Shadow of the Beast III.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga CD32", "release_date": "2014", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Erik Hogan", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/370615-shadow-of-the-beast-trilogy\n"}
