{"altername_name": ["Donk! The Samurai Duck!"], "name": "Donk", "overview": "Donk is an ordinary duck who benefits from having been raised by samurai warriors, who've taught him everything they know about combat psychologies, strategies and skills. To prove himself he has set off to collect crystals from 112 levels of earth. Once you collect the target quota of gems, you must escape from each level through one of its many exits, giving the game a similar structure to Alien Breed: Tower Assault. Magical powers can be collected along the way, including the ability to turn into an inflatable toy duck, which makes it possible to float across water. There is a simultaneous split-screen 2-player mode included as well.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga CD32", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hidden", "publishers": "Supervision Entertainment", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "2.36", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donk!", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/85267-donk\n"}
