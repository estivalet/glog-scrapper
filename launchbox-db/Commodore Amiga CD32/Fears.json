{"altername_name": [], "name": "Fears", "overview": "One of the numerous Doom style games for the Amiga in the mid 90s. Like Gloom, it was published by Guildhall Leisure, who gave the Amiga a lot of time in that era. Fears took the approach of having full-screen, though relatively low-resolution, graphics. The level landscapes feature lots of stairways and lifts, giving it a pseudo-3D feel. The game is played across 30 levels, with a level designer also included. The one-player game has 3 difficulty levels, while multi-player action is available via a null-modem cable.", "platform": "Commodore Amiga CD32", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Bomb Software", "publishers": "Attic Entertainment Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.92", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCtWIy8sqeA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75120-fears\n"}
