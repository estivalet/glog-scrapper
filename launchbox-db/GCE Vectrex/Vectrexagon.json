{"name": "Vectrexagon", "overview": "Vectrexagon is a rhythm action game similar to Hexagon. You control a triangle that can be rotated around a central hexagonal shape. The goal is to avoid touching further hexagons approaching the central hexagon from the borders of the screen for as long as possible. At least one of the sides of those approaching hexagons will be left open, so there is always room to escape. For distraction the whole game screen will constantly rotate around the center, occasionally changing the direction of rotation. Over time - to increase the difficulty - the shapes will start pulsating to the rhythm of the music, and the rotation speed will increase significantly when the soundtrack picks up a new theme. In contrast to the original Hexagon this vector based version is more simplistic: It does not feature any solid or advanced forms, only hexagons. Like the original this version contains only one song which is changing over time to match the gameplay. The game features two difficulty settings (Easy, Hard).", "platform": "GCE Vectrex", "release_date": "2016", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "SDW Developments", "publishers": "SDW Developments", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQK5izu1Nd8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/126608\n"}
