{"name": "Vector Vaders", "overview": "March 8, 1996 marked a day of the rebirth of Vectrex games, as programmer John Dondzila unveiled Vector Vaders, which was not only the very first homebrew game for the machine, but it also started the plethora of new games for the Vectrex as well. Aside from having vector graphics and running a bit slow (although the game does speed up as more and more invaders are shot), this is a pretty standard Space Invaders-type game for the most part.", "platform": "GCE Vectrex", "release_date": "March 8, 1996", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Packrat Video Games, LLC", "publishers": "Packrat Video Games, LLC", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.3", "wikipedia": "http://vectrex.wikia.com/wiki/Vector_Vaders", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AK715J3bQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/47226\n"}
