{"name": "Vector 21", "overview": "Vector 21 is one of the very few card games for the Vectrex, being a cross between Blackjack and Solitaire. It is the player's goal to try to score a point value of 21 or less in a card stack as many times as possible without busting (going over 21) before running out of time. There are also several bonuses rather than just having a stack add up to 21 (which is a Blackjack) as well. Points are also awarded for a Five Card Fury (when five cards are placed in a stack that equals less than 21), as well as there being a time bonus awarded if the player is able to go through the entire deck of cards before time runs out with a minute or more remaining on the clock.", "platform": "GCE Vectrex", "release_date": "2006", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "", "developers": "George Pelonis", "publishers": "Fury Unlimited", "genres": "Casino", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfOmxTy4V1k", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/142562\n"}
