{"name": "Patriots III", "overview": "Patriots III: Ballistics Busters is a completely rewritten version of the original game with three cannons and unlimited ammo. In this version, the player's cannons will require time to reload but never run out of missiles like in the previous versions. In addition, this version also has an option to control the player sites or cross hairs through analog controls, rather that with only digital controls. These controls more closely resemble the controls used in the arcade version which were that of a trackball.", "platform": "GCE Vectrex", "release_date": "2002", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "", "developers": "John Dondzila", "publishers": "", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RE2StBKjv3g", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/142561\n"}
