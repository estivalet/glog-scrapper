{"name": "Vector Pilot", "overview": "Vector Pilot is a faithful clone of Konami's Time Pilot, recreated entirely in vector graphics. Like in the original game you have to navigate your aircraft through 5 different epochs (1910 1940, 1972, 1984 and 2001), shooting enemy vessels to proceed to the next era. Extending the original game this version also features a bonus level, the option to unlock additional vessels and more unlockable features (like playing in reverse or tail gunner mode) hidden in the game. Uncommon for Vectrex games the cartridge contains an EEPROM to save highscores, unlocked items and calibration data. Vector Pilot is a tribute to the ground-breaking Avro Arrow jet aircraft of the 1950s.", "platform": "GCE Vectrex", "release_date": "September 30, 2011", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tutstronix", "publishers": "Tutstronix", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.55", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E85K0tfFgIs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73723\n"}
