{"name": "Bedlam", "overview": "Your home galaxy has been invaded by alien colonists hoping to claim all inhabited worlds as their own. Unacceptable! You have been given the ultimate responsibility of protecting your galactic neighbors from the invaders. Blasting the aliens with the amazing anti-molecular cannon transports them thousands of light years away where they cause no further bedlam. But beware, the invaders will be increasingly ruthless. The future of the galaxy rests on your shoulders. Good luck!", "platform": "GCE Vectrex", "release_date": "June 1, 1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "General Consumer Electronics", "publishers": "General Consumer Electronics", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.03", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVtS1fN2aE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/67467\n"}
