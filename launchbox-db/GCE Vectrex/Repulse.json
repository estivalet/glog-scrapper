{"name": "Repulse", "overview": "REPULSE\u2013clone of the rare Eliminator vector game. I don\u2019t know how it compares, since I never played the original (saw it, but never played it), but it\u2019s addicting and can take a while, due to starting with five ships and then earning a new one with every successful elimination (sorry!) of the mother ship. Unfortunately firing a shot up the mother ship\u2019s slim shaft is difficult, especially with sentry ships thrown in the mix, which a hit from them can send you careening across the screen. A fun, differently-paced challenge than the other games on here, but you need some pretty decent nerves to make it through this one though.
