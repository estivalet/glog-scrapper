{"name": "Vaboom! / Vectrace", "overview": "Also known as Ronen's Game Cart, Vaboom!/Vectrace is a bit of an unusual entry, as there aren't a lot of racing games for the system as it is, as far as Vectrace goes. And it might also seem to be a bit unusual for another Kaboom! clone to be made for the Vectrex as well. So this odd pairing of games actually makes this cartridge stand out a bit.", "platform": "GCE Vectrex", "release_date": "2000", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Packrat Video Games, LLC", "publishers": "Classic Game Creations", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ikohIS3i6I", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/132474\n"}
