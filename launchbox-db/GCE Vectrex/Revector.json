{"name": "Revector", "overview": "Your goal is to out score your opponent in a 7 minute timed match. You can score points by shooting your opponent or by picking up power-up items. Power-up items (available in game one) appear randomly on the playfield to be picked up by players, having various effects and lasting either a certain time or with a set amount of uses. If neither player picks up an item after several seconds they will disappear. Once a game\u2019s seven minutes have run out, the game will end once one or both players have destroyed the others\u2019 vehicle (or they destroy each other at the same time). Revector allows you to take-on another player head-to-head, or a challenging CPU opponent. The game features a rather unique vehicle control system with the joystick controling both rotation and thrust.", "platform": "GCE Vectrex", "release_date": "2004", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "", "developers": "Craig Aker", "publishers": "Packrat Video Games, LLC", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R2D7RXKqDo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/142490\n"}
