{"name": "Pitcher's Duel", "overview": "Pitcher's Duel was an unreleased Vectrex baseball game. A prototype of Pitcher's Duel was found though a private sale and was held until a high quality release could be done. Pitcher's Duel was eventually released at Classic Gaming Expo in both a retro-styled reproduction Vectrex box and also as a loose cartridge. While not a perfect reproduction of the game of baseball, this title is fairly accurate. Standard rules for baseball apply, however fielding, throwing and base runners are all controlled by the computer. At the start of the game Player 1 always pitches first. If a two player game is selected, then Player 2 will be at bat.", "platform": "GCE Vectrex", "release_date": "2007", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "GCE", "publishers": "GCE Services", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83388\n"}
