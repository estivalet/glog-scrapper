{"name": "Wormhole", "overview": "WORMHOLE \u2013 clone of the very classic arcade game Gyruss, where your ship spins around the screen in a giant circle to destroy as many enemy ships as possible. It\u2019s amazing how far Dondzila came with the slow moving early releases of Vector Vaders and More Invaders! (from the All Good Things cartridge) to how incredibly fast the enemy ships swarm in and out of the center of the screen (the \u201cwormhole\u201d). At first this seems like Dondzila\u2019s easiest game to date, since the ships can pass through you without harm and they don\u2019t shoot back, but that won\u2019t last for long (isn\u2019t that always the way?). Making up for not having any of the cool music and the bonus stages, you\u2019re granted three power-ups (rather than the arcade\u2019s one) upon shooting special ships: double shots, destroying everything onscreen, and slowing down the action for several seconds. Pretty intense stuff\u2026", "platform": "GCE Vectrex", "release_date": "2001", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "John Dondzila", "publishers": "", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6K6NNXJrEw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/142487\n"}
