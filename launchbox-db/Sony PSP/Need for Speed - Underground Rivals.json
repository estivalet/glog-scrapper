{"altername_name": [], "name": "Need for Speed: Underground Rivals", "overview": "The night racing scene makes its way onto the PSP with Rivals. This version has been \"tuned\" to better display the racing graphics and animations on the smaller screen. There are 24 licensed cars, 10 of which are muscle cars. The 8 games modes include: Drift Attack, Nitrous Run, Drag Race, Car Spec, Lap Knockout, Circuit, and a new one for the PSP - Rally Relay. The 10 racing circuits feature track layouts exclusive to this version. You can tune and customize your cars like the other games in the Underground Series and you can have a Pocket Garage to show them off. If you decide to go head-to-head via Wi-Fi, watchout 'cause you opponent could own your car if they win. Get up to 4 people to play together via Wi-Fi as well. What would Underground be without the great music tracks? Rivals is no exception, it has 38 tracks already seen, but it also has 6 new songs with the music videos to them.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "March 14, 2005", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Team Fusion", "publishers": "Electronic Arts Games", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.92", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Need_for_Speed:_Underground_2", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLX8qk25nfc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6815-need-for-speed-underground-rivals\n"}
