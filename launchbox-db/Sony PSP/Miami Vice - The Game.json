{"altername_name": ["Miami Vice:"], "name": "Miami Vice: The Game", "overview": "Miami Vice is a third-person shooter for the PlayStation Portable. It was released as a tie-in with the movie of the same name. Therefore, the likeness of the narcotics officers Crockett and Tubbs are based on that of Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx, respectively. While going through levels, the majority of the gameplay is combat, with enemies who must be killed to advance the level. Emphasis is put on taking cover, with health running out quite fast if player remains in the open during a shoot-out. All fire-arms have laser sightings, which acts as an aiming reticule. The player may also deal drugs amongst other suppliers, both buying and selling. Drugs can be bought at one point and kept for several days, in which they may increase in value, thus making a profit for the player. Additionally, varying drugs can be obtained throughout each of the levels, and sold for a profit once the level is complete. Drugs can also be sold to informants for information.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "July 18, 2006", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "M - Mature", "developers": "Rebellion", "publishers": "Vivendi Universal Games", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.36", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Vice:_The_Game", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuSUuZOCzvE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/30506-miami-vice-the-game\n"}
