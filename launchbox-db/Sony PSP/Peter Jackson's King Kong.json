Jack's levels are HUDless FPS levels set on Skull Island. Jack must use a variety of weapons, traps, and fire to kill or repel Skull Island's fauna. Kong's levels are third-person brawlers set on Skull Island and New York City, where Kong must puzzle his way through environmental obstacles and thrash his opponents.
