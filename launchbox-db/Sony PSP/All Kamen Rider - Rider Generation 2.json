{"altername_name": [], "name": "All Kamen Rider: Rider Generation 2", "overview": "All Kamen Rider: Rider Generation 2 is the 2012 sequel to the original Rider Generation for the Nintendo DS, expanding on nearly every facet of the original - the playable stable of Kamen Riders has increased dramatically, older characters have expanded capabilities and movesets, and the game itself was simultaneously released for the DS and Playstation Portable. Just like its predecessor, Rider Generation 2 combines 2D side-scrolling beat-em-up action with stock RPG elements, with each Rider having individual EXP counts and stat training parameters. While the basic structure of a human-played Rider and AI partner remains, Rider Generation 2 also features 2-player functionality via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection or the PSP's Ad Hoc wireless. The password system from Rider Generation 1 has been completely revamped for RG2: instead of unlocking additional stages for each world (and an \"incomplete\" Kamen Rider Fourze), the new, simpler passwords enable players to instantly unlock nearly any Rider in the playable list, negating the wait to mow down tokusatsu villains with fan/personal favorites - whether your favorite may be the massively overhauled Fourze, the classic Rider-1, the poorly-treated-by-America Black RX, the sole female entrant Kiva-la, the currently-airing (and existing in a prototypical state) Wizard, or another Rider entirely.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "August 2, 2012", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bandai", "publishers": "Bandai Namco Games", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/45758-all-kamen-rider-rider-generation-2\n"}
