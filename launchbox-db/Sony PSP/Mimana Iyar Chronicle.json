{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mimana Iyar Chronicle", "overview": "In Mimana Iyar Chronicle, players are cast into the role of Crais Sewell, an anti-social, drunk, unemployed swordsman. As he loses his last cents and gets into a huge debt with the Mercenaries' Guild, he's offered a chance to repay his debt, by offering his services as bodyguard to a little girl known as Sophie, who wants to find seven gems scattered around the world. Walk into a few dungeons, break a few pots, whack a few gelatinous cubes, find the gems, how hard can it be? While the main exploring part of the game takes place in an isometric view, the random encounters the party will face take place in a side-scrolling panel. While the player controls Crais directly, in real-time, the other party member's behavior can be adjusted through menus. Stringing combos together can make Crais go into Just Attack mode, where every attack causes critical damage.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "March 30, 2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "GungHo", "publishers": "Aksys Games Localization", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimana_Iyar_Chronicle", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/13583-mimana-iyar-chronicle\n"}
