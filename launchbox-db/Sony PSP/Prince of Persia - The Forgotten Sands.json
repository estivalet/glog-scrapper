{"altername_name": ["Prince of Persia: Boukyaku no Suna", "Prince of Persia: Las Arenas Olvidadas", "Prince Of Persia: Die vergessene Zeit"], "name": "Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands", "overview": "The PSP version of Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands was developed by the team making it for the Wii, but is a game on its own with a new story, new environments and enemies. The Prince is after the evil fire spirit Ahihud and his minions, who have murdered his family members and taken over his kingdom. The game is a combination of 3D side-view platforming and action. It also lets the player use a big amount of acrobatic skills, such as walking on walls and swinging on ledges. Additionally, there are a lot of puzzles in the game, mainly focusing on moving objects and trying to open locked doors. Some of them require special abilities gained by freeing the Sisters of Time. Every such spirit confers a different time-manipulating power on the player.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "May 18, 2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Ubisoft Quebec", "publishers": "Ubisoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Persia:_The_Forgotten_Sands", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYwy0gSsRfg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/15468-prince-of-persia-the-forgotten-sands\n"}
