{"altername_name": ["James Cameron's Avatar: El Videojuego", "James Cameron's Avatar : Das Spiel"], "name": "James Cameron's Avatar: The Game", "overview": "James Cameron's Avatar: The Game for PSP and Wii shares the setting with the blockbuster movie, but tells a completely different story. A nameless Na\u2019vi warrior, the only survivor of the village destroyed by the RDA (humans), sets on a journey to avenge the death of his people. Along the way he will master his warrior skills, tame a few exotic creatures and find another tribe to accept him as a brother. This is a 3D action game with an emphasis on stealth. The warrior has two means of attack \u2013 a bow and a staff, but there\u2019s not much he can do in an open combat against several soldiers or robots, so he needs to hide behind objects or in the grass and attack stealthily. The warrior collects \u2018Eywa spirits\u2019 to upgrade his weapons and the \u201cway of the hunter\u201d \u2013 a skill that allows him to stay undetected longer or increase attack strength. There are some flying missions as well. The scrolling is automatic, so the warrior just needs to maneuver on screen avoiding bombs or projectiles and shoot down enemies.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "December 7, 2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Ubisoft", "publishers": "20th Century Fox", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cameron%27s_Avatar:_The_Game", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8kiV2BmmbE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/14792-james-camerons-avatar-the-game\n"}
