{"altername_name": ["Planetarian: The Reverie of a Little Planet", "Planetarian: The Dream of a Little Star"], "name": "Planetarian: Chiisana Hoshi no Yume", "overview": "\"Why don't you come to the planetarium? The beautiful twinkling of eternity that will never fade, no matter what. All the stars in the sky are waiting for you.\" It is thirty years after the failure of the Space Colonization Program. Humanity is nearly extinct. A perpetual and deadly Rain falls on the Earth. Men known as \"Junkers\" plunder goods and artifacts from the ruins of civilization. One such Junker sneaks alone into the most dangerous of all ruins -- a \"Sarcophagus City\". In the center of this dead city, he discovers a pre-War planetarium. And as he enters he is greeted by Hoshino Yumemi, a companion robot. Without a single shred of doubt, she assumes he is the first customer she's had in 30 years. She attempts to show him the stars at once, but the planetarium projector is broken. Unable to make heads or tails of her conversation, he ends up agreeing to try and repair the projector... In the future, mankind has almost wiped itself out due to a long-running global nuclear war brought on by the panic that arose from the depletion of all of Earth's natural resources, and the subsequent failure to colonize other planets. With \"The War\" over and only a few thousand people left, a constantly falling rain, which is potentially deadly due to years and years of nuclear fallout, threatens to destroy the rest. The protagonist of the story is a scavenger who has broken into an abandoned city. He takes refuge from the rain inside a large department store building and finds something very unexpected on the top floor... Planetarian is a \"kinetic novel\", or a linear, non-interactive visual novella, running on Key's RealLive engine, that will take about 4 or 5 hours to read.
