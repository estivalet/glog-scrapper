{"altername_name": [], "name": "Macross Triangle Frontier", "overview": "Macross Triangle Frontier is the sequel to Macross Ultimate Frontier, the third installment in a series where Artdink incorporated mechanics from the Gundam Battle series into the gameplay. The game features a simulation segment called \"Academy Mode\" where players can create a custom character to attend Mihoshi Academy and interact with characters from Macross Frontier as well as the original characters first introduced in Macross Ace Frontier and Macross Ultimate Frontier. Upon unlocking the options through repeated play, players can choose to affiliate with SMS, NUNS or remain a civilian. Relationships established here will also reflect in the Campaign mode, where the custom character and the originals relive the events of the Macross series past and present, building their own love triangles in the process.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "February 3, 2011", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "ArtDink", "publishers": "Bandai Namco Entertainment", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.92", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/114503-macross-triangle-frontier\n"}
