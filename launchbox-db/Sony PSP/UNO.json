{"altername_name": [], "name": "UNO", "overview": "Uno is a conversion of the popular card game of the same name. The goal is to be the first player to get rid of all of your cards, but you have to shout out Uno! when you have one card left, or you have to pick up another one. Players take turns to play special cards that skip players, force players to draw additional cards, reverse the flow of the game, and so on. A card can only be placed on top of the pile if it is the same type of card, or if it is the same colour. If neither of these conditions occur, the player must pick up another card. There are three different modes of play in Gameloft's version of Uno: Quick Play - selecting this begins a game of Uno immediately. Tournament - in this mode, you must beat your opponents in five rounds of Uno. Custom Game - this mode lets you play Uno however you play it normally. Many features are customizable, such as AI difficulty, scoring type, penalties, and how you draw additional cards.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "April 22, 2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Gameloft Software Shanghai", "publishers": "Gameloft", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/103397-uno\n"}
