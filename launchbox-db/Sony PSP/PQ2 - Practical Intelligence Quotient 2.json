{"altername_name": ["Intelligent License 2", "Practical IQ"], "name": "PQ2: Practical Intelligence Quotient 2", "overview": "PQ2: Practical Intelligence Quotient 2 is based on testing the model of human intelligence developed by Dr. Masuo Koyasu at Kyoto University. PQ2: Practical Intelligence Quotient 2 shares many features with the first PQ game and similar platform-like puzzle games. In each stage, the player controls a human avatar in a virtual reality world, climbing and dropping from levels, lifting, dropping, pushing and pulling boxes in order to activate switches and lifts, block laser beams, and to create stairways in order to reach an exit point. The player must also avoid guards that make rounds on the level. The main game is presented as an intelligence test of 100 stages. The player is given a total cumulative time of 5 hours to complete all 100 puzzles; time is only counted while the player is performing the puzzles, and the player can save and come back at any time without time penalty. The player's score is based on the number of \"moves\" (excluding walking around) on the stage, the time it took to complete it, and the number of attempts at that stage. A player can skip a stage with a scoring penalty; levels not completed in the 5 hour limit are also penalized against the player. Once completed, the player can upload their score to worldwide scoring tables to compare their results.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "June 18, 2007", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Now Production", "publishers": "D3Publisher", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.93", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PQ2:_Practical_Intelligence_Quotient_2", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrngYFvwP48", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/18788-pq2-practical-intelligence-quotient-2\n"}
