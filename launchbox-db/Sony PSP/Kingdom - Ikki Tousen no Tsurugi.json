{"altername_name": [], "name": "Kingdom: Ikki Tousen no Tsurugi", "overview": "This game is based on the Kingdom manga and anime series. It's a beat'em up game that has a lot similarity to Dynasty Warrior franchise in terms of controls, attack combos, field items and winning conditions. The only thing that makes this game unique is the 5 man squad combat system, where the character can do combos with the other 4 members of the squad. When your character has gained enough power (from attacking, taking damage, or just charging it up by holding one of the two attack buttons) you can unleash the special attack that varies on the type of squad you are using. You are not the only player that can do this though, as some enemies can use special attacks.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "November 25, 2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Shade", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIaRo-AyPqA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/54646-kingdom-ikki-tousen-no-tsurugi\n"}
