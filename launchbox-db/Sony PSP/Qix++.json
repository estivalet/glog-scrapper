{"altername_name": [], "name": "Qix++", "overview": "QIX++ is a Xbox Live Arcade remake of the game QIX that now includes high definition graphics. The object of the game is to defeat the \"QIX\" using the user controlled marker to cut off more than 75% of the playing area. Once the 75% of the playing area is cut off, you will advance to the next level. During the game, the QIX will come in the form of waves, expanding triangle patterns and floating circles. Also hindering you in-game will be energy pulses along the edge of the playing area that will cost you a life if you come into contact with it. However you do get some help during play. If you cut of an area with a pick-up in it, you will get a helping boost. These come in the form of point boosts and limited invincibility. You have two stages to complete, each with eight sections to them. Multiplayer offers either local or online play where you can compete with up to 4 players or bots. The aim of QIX++ in multiplayer is identical to the single player element, only you are now racing to be the one that clears the board first.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "February 25, 2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Taito", "publishers": "Taito", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90951-qix\n"}
