{"altername_name": ["Eiyuu Densetsu Gagharv Trilogy V: Umi no Oriuta"], "name": "The Legend of Heroes III: Song Of The Ocean", "overview": "Song of the Ocean is the third installment in Nihon Falcom's RPG PSP trilogy, a third remake based on the games in the early nineties. Despite the number 3 (as the third part of the Gagharv Trilogy), it is in fact a remake of the fifth title in the series, Umi no Oriuta. This part is a standalone story that takes place in the realm of Weltluna, which was once the center of an ancient civilization known as the Water Tribe, and the game closes the Gagharv trilogy. It draws upon a number of the conventions from the previous titles and provides 30-50 hours of gameplay. You control Forto, who sets off on an adventure to locate a song left behind by a legendary composer. The game features an improved battle system, which allows you to change party members during battle. While you travel you will meet a variety of characters, of whom six will be able to join your party. The game also features an extra bonus if you have save data from either of the first two Legend of Heroes games on your memory card. From time to time, you will come across areas where you can teleport to a special section. There, you can team up with characters from the previous games and go on optional adventures for experience, money, and items - an addition that rewards players who have been following the series from the beginning.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "January 23, 2007", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "Microvision", "publishers": "Namco", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Heroes_III:_Song_of_the_Ocean", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wvkhIdMH54", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/12581-the-legend-of-heroes-iii-song-of-the-ocean\n"}
