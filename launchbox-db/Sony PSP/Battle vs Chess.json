{"altername_name": ["Check vs. Mate"], "name": "Battle vs Chess", "overview": "Battle vs. Chess was the subject of a lawsuit by Interplay as it was essentially a modernized version of Interplay's late 1980s Battle Chess, created without permission. It was released for consoles and PC in Europe, and eventually released as Check vs. Mate for the PC on Steam in North America. This prototype for PSP seems to be finished, and was recovered from a factory pressed UMD with a real serial number (ULES-01517), so it seems that it nearly made it to the finish line before being canned.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "August 16, 2012", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Targem Games", "publishers": "TopWare Interactive", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/340327-battle-vs-chess\n"}
