{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Elder Scrolls Travels: Oblivion", "overview": "The Elder Scrolls Travels: Oblivion is a cancelled action RPG in The Elder Scrolls series that was planned to be released for PSP, based on the main Oblivion game released for PC, Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 in 2006. The game was in development at Climax Group London (former Syrox Developments, from Kingston upon Thames, UK) with some help from Climax Group Los Angeles in 2005 / 2006, with new characters, inventory system, combat system, levels and more features exclusive for this PSP version. Because of the Playstation Portable hardware limitations, Elder Scrolls Travels: Oblivion was going to be a more linear game than the original Bethesda Game Studios version. There was a hub world which contained various vendors, NPCs and story characters, and player would have used a teleportation crystal to go to each of the explorable areas of the game. However, the game was never released. There has never been any official reason given for its cancellation or even official confirmation that it was canceled. Bethesda Softworks has declined to speak on the matter. On 17 May 2016, footage as well as copies of beta builds of the game from June 2006 and January 2007 were leaked. The footage was taken down by ZeniMax, but restored shortly after.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "April 27, 2007", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "RP - Rating Pending", "developers": "The Climax Group", "publishers": "Bethesda Softworks", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elder_Scrolls_Travels#Oblivion", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0gCKfDfuVo?t=24s", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/98051-the-elder-scrolls-travels-oblivion\n"}
