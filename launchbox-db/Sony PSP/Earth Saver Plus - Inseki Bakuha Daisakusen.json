{"altername_name": [], "name": "Earth Saver Plus: Inseki Bakuha Daisakusen", "overview": "A giant meteorite is headed straight for Earth. Land your spaceship on the meteorite and set explosives to break off small pieces so the rock breaks up in Earth's atmosphere. Chunks of meteorite that are too big will smash into Earth, wiping out mankind. As an explosives expert, you can plant a series of bombs to create chain-reaction combos, easily blasting off chunks of rock the size of houses. You'll also need to tackle the many strange alien life forms you encounter by either blowing them up or cunningly blasting around the piece of rock they're standing on so they fall with the meteorite. Can you save Earth from obliteration and secure the future of mankind?", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "April 15, 2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Tom Create", "publishers": "Tom Create", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/139688-earth-saver-plus-inseki-bakuha-daisakusen\n"}
