{"altername_name": ["LittleBigPlanet Portable", "Little Big Planet"], "name": "LittleBigPlanet", "overview": "Travel to the world of LittleBigPlanet, where dreams and imagination run wild! Become a Sackperson, and dress them up as you wish with all sorts of gear that you come across in the game worlds. Explore the levels made by the Creator Curators, or create your own and send them to the world! LittleBigPlanet is a platform game based on the PlayStation 3 game of the same name. In it, you control a Sackperson, with the base goal of reaching the level exit. However, many physics-based objects and puzzles are encountered along the way. There are also many tricks, traps and enemies. Aside from being able to jump, your Sackperson can also hop between the two levels of depth (unlike the PlayStation 3 version, which features three levels) in the level to walk in front or behind objects, grab objects to push or pull them, or even hitch a ride on a tethered jetpack and fly about the area. A huge feature of LittleBigPlanet is the ability to create and share levels with millions of other players around the world. You can make your own levels with objects you've collected in the single player mode, and then use those objects to make anything you like - whether it be a platform level, action game, music box - anything! The level creator allows for a lot of freedom and also offers detailed tutorials on how to use and place objects, as well as tweak their variables. The PSP version of LittleBigPlanet is not able to play four player simultaneous multiplayer like the PS3 version - instead it is a single player only game.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "November 17, 2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Media Molecule", "publishers": "Sony Computer Entertainment", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.95", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LittleBigPlanet_(2009_video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XQYNC5cm2A", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6799-littlebigplanet\n"}
