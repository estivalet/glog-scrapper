{"altername_name": ["FIFA 13", "FIFA 13: World Class Soccer"], "name": "FIFA Soccer 13", "overview": "EA Sports' massively popular soccer sim returns to the pitch for a 20th season of action with more than 500 officially licensed clubs, enhanced dribbling techniques, and goalkeeper controls in FIFA Soccer 13. New changes to the A.I. have players breaking down defenses and making runs to open up passing lanes, while more precise dribbling controls give gamers full 360-degree mobility, and first-touch control helps defenders win back possession after errant passes and bad touches. The career-based \"Be a Pro\" mode returns, letting gamers create a player, build him into a superstar, and follow his career through 15 seasons and on into coaching. The \"Challenge Mode\" puts players in a variety of game scenarios, rewarding them with points that can be used for character and team upgrades, while the \"Soccer IQ\" mode offers trivia challenges for soccer buffs.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "September 25, 2012", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Electronic Arts", "publishers": "EA Sports", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.83", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_13", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AhYtsUFw2k", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/24249-fifa-soccer-13\n"}
