Our tale begins on the primitive planet of Roak where Roddick lives in the peaceful and uneventful town of Kratus. As a member of the village\u2019s local \u201cDefence Force\u201d tasked with the protection of Kratus, Roddick learns of a strange disease that has broken out in the neighboring town. Those infected turn to stone, but continue to live on in a petrified state. Roddick, along with his two friends Millie and Dorne, make their way to the neighboring town. Informed of a cure for the sickness, they head to Mt. Metorx where a healing herb is rumored to grow. When they reach the summit, the party encounter the mysterious Ronyx and Ilia, who appear before them in a pillar of light. Thus, the story of Star Ocean finally begins... Serving as a remake of the first Star Ocean, which was never released in the West, First Departure adds several new elements, including a whole new art style with 3D environments and redrawn character sprites, a tweaked battle system, anime cutscenes, and bonus content while still preserving the exciting storyline and themes of the original.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "October 21, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Tose Software", "publishers": "Square Enix", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.01", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Ocean_(video_game)#First_Departure", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jevWogIIxI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/12094-star-ocean-first-departure\n"}
