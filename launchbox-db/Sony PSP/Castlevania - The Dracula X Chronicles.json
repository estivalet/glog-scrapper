The remake features 3D graphics, though the gameplay is largely identical to the 2D platform style of the original. It also adds a Boss Rush mode that unlocks a minigame when completed three times. The original version of the game as well as Castlevania: Symphony of the Night are included as unlockable content. This version of Symphony of the Night allows the player to control Maria as the protagonist (like in the earlier Saturn version) and also has new sound effects and voice acting. This version of Symphony of the Night sticks closer to the Japanese PlayStation release of the game as it still lacks the Saturn exclusive areas.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "October 23, 2007", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.26", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castlevania:_Rondo_of_Blood#Castlevania:_The_Dracula_X_Chronicles", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ffnp9rmQvUY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6782-castlevania-the-dracula-x-chronicles\n"}
