{"altername_name": [], "name": "MotoGP", "overview": "MotoGP is a motorcycle racing game based on the 2005 MotoGP season. It features all the riders from that 2005 season, but only eight of the seventeen circuits. There are two main modes of play, arcade and season. Arcade allows the player to select any rider and track to race on. Season mode allows the player to take part in a complete season with one 'real-life' rider, or alternatively to compete over multiple seasons with a fictional rider, with the ability to move teams at the end of the season depending on the performance during the season. Different levels of difficulty relating to the realism of the bikes handling and performance are offered to cater for both novice and more experienced players. All the usual setup options are available to tune the bikes for each track.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "October 27, 2006", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Namco Bandai Games", "publishers": "Sony Computer Entertainment Europe", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "8", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.96", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/18773-motogp\n"}
