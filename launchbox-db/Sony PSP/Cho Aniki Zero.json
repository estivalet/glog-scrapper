{"altername_name": ["Zero Choaniki"], "name": "Cho Aniki Zero", "overview": "After the defeat of the evil Emperor Body, it seemed like peace may finally return to the Builder star system. However, a new force has begun to drain the Protien from the planets here: Emperor Body the Second. Idaten and Benten, having defeated Body before, immediately set off to destroy the plant that's draining the Protein, and defeat evil once and for all. Zero Ch\u014d Aniki is a side-scrolling shooter from the infamously bizarre Ch\u014d Aniki series. Controlling either Idaten or Benten and their options, the player must survive five stages filled with curiously suggestive enemies and environments. Destroying enemies will earn power-ups to increase the player's output, and there are also bombs and the special \"Men's Beam\" which can help clear the screen if things get overwhelmingly hectic. There are two difficulty settings on offer, and in addition to the main mode, there is also a boss rush mode unlocked after clearing the game.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "March 25, 2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "extreme", "publishers": "Aksys Games", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.41", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/18750-cho-aniki-zero\n"}
