{"altername_name": ["Armored Core: Formula Front: Extreme Battle", "Armored Core: Formula Front International"], "name": "Armored Core: Formula Front", "overview": "Armored Core: Formula Front is a mecha video game developed by FromSoftware and published by Agetec. It was a launch title for the PlayStation Portable in Japan and is a spin-off in Armored Core series. The player assumes the role of an Architect. An Architect is a person who builds, programs and battles with a modified Armored Core known as a u/AC or an Unmanned Armored Core. u/ACs are AI controlled Armored Cores which compete exclusively in battling tournaments. u/ACs battle independent of the Architect's control, so the Architect must influence how the u/AC fights by customizing various part combinations and loading various program functions into the u/AC's AI. The North American version of the PSP game has since been modified to allow players the option of actually piloting their u/AC in battle instead of letting the AI fight. In the game, this is called a N-u/AC (N standing for Naked) and is supposedly notoriously hard to control. Armored Core: Formula Front allows the player to build their own robot using 480 different parts. These part come in several categories. These categories are head, core, arms, legs, generator, fire control system, booster, radiator, extension, inside, right arm weapon, left arm weapon, back left weapon, back right weapon, right hangar unit, left hangar unit, and optional parts. Several different part types can also be available. For instance, there are three types of cores (OB, EO, and Standard). Other types of customization include paint, AI tune, Parts Tune, Repository, Sortie Order, Name Entry, Sample Emblem, and Edit Emblem.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "December 15, 2005", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "FromSoftware", "publishers": "Agetec", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.17", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armored_Core:_Formula_Front", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoXVhfkf1lM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6775-armored-core-formula-front\n"}
