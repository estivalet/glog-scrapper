Along with fellow ninja Rin, Ayame must employ ancient skills--such as supervision, wall-running, and enemy freeze--to determine who is responsible for this crime. In Fatal Shadows, you can play as either Ayame or Rin in three gameplay modes. This time, though, you can kill multiple enemies at once, as well as move bodies and hide underwater to avoid detection. Additionally, you can pick up a variety of new weapons and items.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "January 28, 2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "FromSoftware", "publishers": "FromSoftware", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/121342-ninja-katsugeki-tenchu-kurenai-portable\n"}
