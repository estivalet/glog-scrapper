{"altername_name": [], "name": "Madden NFL 11", "overview": "The Madden series returns for another season on the PSP with Madden NFL 11. Changes to the predecessor are minimal and mainly consist of roster updates, a new soundtrack and newly-recorded commentary. All game modes return: play now, franchise, mini-camp, practice and Superstar Challenge. The challenges have been updated for the 2009 season and again allow players to play either Hero or Spoiler. The Play Designer also returns. Multiplayer is no longer available via infrastructure but ad hoc only. The commentary is provided by Gus Johnson and Cris Collingsworth.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "August 10, 2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "EA Tiburon", "publishers": "EA Sports", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/89963-madden-nfl-11\n"}
