The protagonist (Rose Dinoire), who is the only daughter of the demon lord who leads the demons, is fated to someday succeed her father. One day, her father receives an oracle from the God of Darkness, and leaves the castle. Though perplexed by the prematurity, she ascends the demonic throne. However, being the demon lord was far more intense than she had imagined. Since there are many demons who kill humans for fun, humans view demons in a hostile light.
