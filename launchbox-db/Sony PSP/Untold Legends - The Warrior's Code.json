The warlord has taken over as emperor with a reign of oppression where the helpless people are either enslaved or killed by his vicious minions. During this time there is a secret race of shapeshifters who mysteriously begin to disappear, bringing up fear of a plot to eliminate them. As a result, they begin to flee towards the edge of the city towards the walls to evade whatever is capturing or killing their ancient race. You are a member of this shapeshifting race, and in the process of literally running for your life, you and several others come across a secret that brings hope to your people that peace and freedom may yet have a chance. At the beginning of the game you are allowed to choose a class, from Guardian, Mercenary, Disciple, Prowier and Scout.
