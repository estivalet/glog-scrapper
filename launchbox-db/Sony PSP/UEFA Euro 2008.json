This time it's basically FIFA 08 modified to let the player experience this summer's European Championship. Euro 2008 lets you control any European national football team in many different ways. For example you can decide to create your own character and play as good as possible on your position on the field in order to become good enough to captain your team. This is basically a slightly modified version of the \"be a pro\"-mode from FIFA 08. You can also try different challenges and tournament modes in order to unlock extras or just test your abilities. You can play through the full championship experience, including the qualifying stages, or you can skip ahead to the group stages. You can also play a very extensive challenge mode where you try to make you nation the best in European football by clearing different challenges against all the other European teams.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "May 19, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Electronic Arts Canada", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y2T3i43uiA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/33275-uefa-euro-2008\n"}
