{"altername_name": ["Gradius Portable"], "name": "Gradius Collection", "overview": "Gradius Collection is a compilation of five beloved games in the Gradius series available for the first time on the PSP system. Spanning more than 20 years, the five games Gradius, Gradius II, Gradius III, Gradius IV, and the long awaited Gradius Gaiden (never before released in the U.S.), deliver hours of classic 2D shooting action on the go. Taking advantage of the PSP system's technology, The Gradius Collection offers a Gallery Mode that is full of unique features. This includes the opportunity to view movies from various games in the series, as well as the ability to listen to the pulse-pounding music from each title. Additionally, gamers can choose their own screen orientation, giving them the option to view the game in the original arcade specs or use the full PSP system screen to increase the game viewing area.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "June 6, 2006", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.98", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6789-gradius-collection\n"}
