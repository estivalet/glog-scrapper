{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dead End: Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dead End", "overview": "Capitalizing on the vampire craze the world seems to be in, players of Dead End will control some high school kids and fight society\u2019s new favorite villain. Its gameplay is styled like a choose-your-own-adventure book. Remember those? Each action in the game (such as \u201cGo left\u201d or \u201cOpen the door\u201d) is represented by a numbered \u201cparagraph\u201d in the story, and players spend the game jumping from paragraph to paragraph. This means that there are multiple story branches, and players could play the game several times without even seeing all of the story. Jumping from paragraph to paragraph will also be used to solve puzzles within the game. Fights within the game involve dice rolls, with certain numbers corresponding to different attacks and skills for both the player and enemy.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "September 29, 2011", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "TEXT.", "publishers": "Alchemist", "genres": "Visual Novel", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/120955-dead-end-orchestral-manoeuvres-in-the-dead-end\n"}
