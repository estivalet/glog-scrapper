{"altername_name": ["Misshitsu no Sakurifaisu"], "name": "Misshitsu no Sacrifice", "overview": "Maki wakes up on the floor of a strange room. Water is seeping in from the ceiling, and her leg is trapped under rubble. She doesn't know where she is or how she got there, only that she must find a way out. A strange, futuristic complex, seemingly deserted after some unknown disaster. Other survivors are elsewhere in the complex, but what their intentions are is yet unknown. Misshitsu no Sacrifice (Sacrifice of the Secret Room) is a Japanese visual novel combined with western adventure-game-style item and logic puzzles. The game is divided into numerous short chapters, each played from a specific character's perspective, each of which includes a handful of puzzles in addition to fully-voiced story sequences. After each chapter, the player much choose which character to play next, and the outcome of the story will change depending on what order the chapters are played. In \"Search Mode\", the player is presented with still images of the scene. The player can investigate areas of interest by clicking on them, picking up useful items and finding out more about the environment. Collected items may also need to be used together or combined in order to solve puzzles. Movement is generally limited to only one or a handful of rooms, with the story moving forward automatically after puzzles have been solved, and all information and items needed for that area are found there.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "February 4, 2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Intense!
