{"altername_name": [], "name": "Battle Spirits: Kiseki no Hasha", "overview": "The game focusses on an original protagonist, Seiya, who attends the same school as Toppa Bashin and comes in possession of a cornerstone. Meanwhile, J returns to Japan, to show off a new Battle system and somehow, Dan was transported from Otherworld to Toppa's world. In this game, Battle Spirits is not played according to the card game rules. Instead, players appear on a round field, where they can battle alongside their spirits. Some spirits can be summoned to the field (where both spirits and the players themselves are vulnerable to their attacks), while others provide field effects or can just be used for a single attack. Magic cards are also playable for support, and nexus cards act as invisible traps. The opposite of the game is to bring your opponent's health to zero. To gain more cards, you must earn money through battle, and use the towers in the Battle Spirits center. Some promo cards are also available via passwords.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "November 12, 2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Dimps", "publishers": "Bandai Namco Games", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/119687-battle-spirits-kiseki-no-hasha\n"}
