This is the first in a two-game series, and some anime will only have their stories partially completed in this game. Despite this, the developer claims that Z2 will feature more missions than any other handheld SRW. Z2 introduces many popular series from the latter half of the previous decade, including Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, Gundam 00, and Code Geass. However, this game also marks the debut of Armored Trooper Votoms, one of the earliest pioneers of the \"Real Robot\" genre of mecha anime.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "April 14, 2014", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "B.B.Studio", "publishers": "Bandai Namco Games", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/23674-dai-2-ji-super-robot-taisen-z-hakai-hen\n"}
