{"altername_name": ["Everybody's Tennis", "Minna no Tennis Portable"], "name": "Hot Shots Tennis: Get a Grip", "overview": "Everybody's Tennis is basically a port of Everybody's Tennis on PlayStation 2 but with several gameplay additions, for example a story: the player has the mission to bring the \"Happy Tennis Club\" to world fame. He walks through the tennis grounds and other locations, talks to people and of course plays matches to progress the plot. Every character has advantages and disadvantages and some of them - basically bosses - are unlocked after beating them. Victories and other accomplishments reward experience points which improve the athlete's abilities like stamina or accuracy. New are many clothes and accessories which also give certain benefits and can be purchased with prize money. The game itself is very arcade oriented which means the player only needs to the correct position to the ball and a good timing. The player also can choose between different shot variants by pressing the assigned buttons. The story mode is the only playing mode but the player can create non-plot matches and multiplayer games within it.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "June 29, 2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Clap Hanz", "publishers": "Sony Computer Entertainment", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.72", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjlVyhXYOiM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/14114-hot-shots-tennis-get-a-grip\n"}
