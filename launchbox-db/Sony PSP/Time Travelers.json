A demo of the game was included with the release of Level-5's Nintendo 3DS eShop title, Guild01. The game's mystery-themed narrative was penned by Jiro Ishii, who previously directed Chunsoft's acclaimed 2008 visual novel 428: Shibuya Scramble, as well as the 1987 cyberpunk adventure game Imitation City. Time Travelers is a cinematic interactive drama game with multiple choices. Usually, if a main character makes a mistake or dies, they can reverse time to perform the right action. Their choices will be displayed in the flowchart. The right choices are necessary to advance the story. A final choice determines which ending the player gets. The game has quick time events, in which players must perform actions by quickly pressing the right button. Both Nintendo 3DS and PlayStation Vita version can be played using either the touch screen or buttons, while the PlayStation Portable version lacks the touch screen functionality. The Vita version features higher fidelity graphics and larger resolution.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "July 19, 2012", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Level-5", "publishers": "Level-5", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Travelers_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164980-time-travelers\n"}
