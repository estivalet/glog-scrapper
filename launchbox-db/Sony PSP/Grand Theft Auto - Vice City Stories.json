Opportunity abounds in a city emerging from the swamps, its growth fueled by the violent power struggle in a lucrative drug trade. Construction is everywhere as a shining metropolis rises from foundations of crime and betrayal. As a soldier, Vic Vance has always protected his dysfunctional family, his country, and himself. One bad decision later and that job is about to get much harder. Kicked out onto the streets of a city torn between glamor and gluttony, Vic is faced with a stark choice: build an empire or be crushed. GTA: VCS is the PlayStation Portable follow-up to Rockstar's monumental handheld entry in the series, Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories. As in Liberty City Stories, this game ventures back to the location of the second PS2 game.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "October 31, 2006", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "M - Mature", "developers": "Rockstar Leeds", "publishers": "Rockstar Games", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "6", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.06", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto:_Vice_City_Stories", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGi1HYmo2FU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6792-grand-theft-auto-vice-city-stories\n"}
