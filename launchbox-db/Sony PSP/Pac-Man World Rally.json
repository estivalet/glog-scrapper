{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pac-Man World Rally", "overview": "A kart-race game with Pac-Man and other characters from previous Pac-Man games and other Namco franchises. For instance the PlayStation Portable version features Mr. Driller, Mappy and the Prince from Katamari Damacy . The game is packed with not only the traditional Dots to consume and enemies to avoid, but also with power-ups and temporary advantages which players should use strategically to win the race and beat opponents. One example is a power slide to turn corners at full speed. Of course, enemies can also be bitten after eating a Power Pellet.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "August 22, 2006", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Smart Bomb Interactive", "publishers": "Bandai Namco Games", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.41", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man_World_Rally", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i76qsMCZcEQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40965-pac-man-world-rally\n"}
