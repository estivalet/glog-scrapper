{"altername_name": [], "name": "NBA 06", "overview": "While the same series as it's console cousin, this one has a few notably differences. While it does feature the gameplay options of Exhibition, Practice, Season, Playoffs, Minigames and Wireless mode. The most notably difference is the lack of \"The Life\" mode that its PS2 counterpart features. There are also completely different minigames which are the Playstation Skills Challenge, the 3-Point Shoot-out as well as classic schoolyard games such as HORSE, Paint and Dodgeball. Players can also unlock jerseys and Upper Deck trading cards by completing these mini-games. Players can also play against human opponents utilizing the Ad-Hoc wireless feature, playing against them in exhibition matches as well as trading user-made trading cards, where players can take pictures of their characters in action and create a trading card, saving them to their memory card and trading them wirelessly.
