{"altername_name": [], "name": "Super Fruit Fall", "overview": "Super Fruitfall is a simple tile matching game. The playing field is a frame which is differently shaped in every level, e.g. sometimes a regular square or a tube. The interior space also features different forms. Fruits are spread out in this frame which the player can rotate either left, right or 180\u00b0. Then of course the fruits start falling and if multiple of the same kind touch each other they vanish. The goal of a level is to get rid of every fruit. There are 50 levels and four playing modes: arcade (solving as many levels as possible in a limited time), time challenge (solving one level with the fastest time), training (no clock) and a split-screen mode for two players.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "August 10, 2007", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Nissimo", "publishers": "System 3", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/79093-super-fruit-fall\n"}
