{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pro Yakyuu Spirits 2010", "overview": "The game features all 12 Nippon Professional Baseball teams, and both the Pacific League and Central League All-Star teams (circa 2006, but with changes made for traded and/or retired players). The difficulty level for the game is adjustable. The easiest mode will appeal to younger players who have probably never played a baseball game before in their lives, and the hardest mode\u2014known as Spirits Mode\u2014will give even the most experienced and advanced players a challenge with superior AI. Other modes can be selected in a sort of pseudo-gameplay sliders mode. For instance, gameplay speed can be increased, as well as pitch speed (which can be set to \"real\" speed). The basic batting interface is a silhouette of a bat which influences how the ball will travel. Depending on when and where contact was made, that influences where the ball goes. The pitching is a 2-click system where the player selects his pitch around a grid, presses X to start his delivery, then pressing X as one circle converges on another to try and perfectly time the pitch.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "April 1, 2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.62", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/15736-pro-yakyuu-spirits-2010\n"}
