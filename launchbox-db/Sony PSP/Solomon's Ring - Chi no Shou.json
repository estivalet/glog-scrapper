{"altername_name": [], "name": "Solomon's Ring: Chi no Shou", "overview": "Based on the Legend of Solomon, who was known to be the third king of the Israelites, who built the Temple of Jerusalem, and who was said to possess a magical ring that had the powers to control demons. He soon saw the dangers of their arrogance, and sealed them all into a brass vase. Approximately 2500 years later, a certain demon, Lucifer, has taken the reins to be the most powerful demon. He turned his extreme hatred for Solomon into dark magic, and successfully released the seal upon the brass vase. Now free, his goal is nothing less than to seek revenge upon his enemy, Solomon, and destroy the human world in which Solomon lived. Scorched with an evil desire, Lucifer orders demons under him to eliminate Solomon\u2019s descendants as well as the legendary ring. On the other hand, over the years, the existence of the seal Solomon had left gradually begins to fade within the memories of the people in the human world. It is there that the heroine, Lily, lives humbly while managing a library she inherits from her grandfather.
