{"altername_name": ["Ape Escape Racing"], "name": "Saru Get You: Pipo Saru Racer", "overview": "Put the monkey to the metal! Pipo Saru Racer is just your average car racer, at least if you consider monkeys with tires on their limbs and an engine on their back cars! The game features 47 unlockable monkey cars each with two specializations: one for drifting and one for acceleration. The main game consists four racing tracks in a Grand Prix: The Beach, The City, The Graveyard and The Jungle. As the player improves their race times and fills the monkey bar new courses within the four levels are unlocked. Use the PlayStation Portable's wireless capabilities for game sharing and ad-hoc wireless LAN multiplayer races to see who's the fastest monkey around!", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "December 7, 2006", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Epics", "publishers": "Sony Computer Entertainment", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "6", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.7", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epics_(company)#Ape_Escape_Racing", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8MYidtoBcY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/88558-saru-get-you-pipo-saru-racer\n"}
