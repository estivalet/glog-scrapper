As with its predecessor, the game revolves around players competing in the FX400 anti-gravity racing league. Players pilot anti-gravity ships owned by racing corporations. This entry in the racing series features 24 new reversible circuits, a load of fresh high-speed vehicles and some deadly new weaponry. There's also a new track feature called the Mag-Strip, which acts like a magnet and temporarily locks ships to the levels, enabling exciting things like loops and vertical drops.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "February 12, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "Sony Studio Liverpool", "publishers": "Sony Computer Entertainment", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.98", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wipeout_Pulse", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ4JEgtEWFQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/16766-wipeout-pulse\n"}
