{"altername_name": ["Eiyuu Densetsu: Sora no Kiseki the 3rd"], "name": "The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky the 3rd", "overview": "The game plays similarly to its predecessors, a role-playing video game with turn-based battles, but this time enemies have affinities to the three higher elements of time, space and mirage. Other additions are the turn bonuses of \"rush\", allowing the player to take two actions at once, \"guard\", which nullifies any damage, \"vanish\", which makes a target disappear for a few turns, and \"death\", which gives the attack the effect of an instant death. Throughout the games' dungeons the player will find doors engraved with symbols of the moon, stars and the sun, which trigger, respectively, long story scenes, short story scenes, and mini-games. Those scenes usually tell the story of past events and may feature battles.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "July 24, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Nihon Falcom", "publishers": "Nihon Falcom", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Heroes:_Trails_in_the_Sky_the_3rd", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/118558-the-legend-of-heroes-trails-in-the-sky-the-3rd\n"}
