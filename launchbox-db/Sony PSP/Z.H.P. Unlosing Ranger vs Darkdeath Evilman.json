{"altername_name": ["Zettai Hero Kaizou Keikaku"], "name": "Z.H.P. Unlosing Ranger vs Darkdeath Evilman", "overview": "In the year 20XX, in Tokyo, Japan, the prophecized savior of humanity, Super Baby gets kidnapped by Demon General Darkdeath Evilman. Only the hero Absolute Victory Unlosing Ranger can defeat him...until he gets hit by a van. Before passing away, the hero passes on his Morph Belt to a random bystander, who must then become the Unlosing Ranger and face Darkdeath Evilman... Z.H.P. Unlosing Ranger VS Darkdeath Evilman is a roguelike tactical RPG featuring a single character rather than a party. The levels are accessed from a hub, the Hero Base, found on a planet on the other side of the sun, Bizarro Earth. Unlosing Ranger must face enemies by himself by moving around in each of the isometric dungeon maps. When the main character enters the enemies' Field of View Range, he gets noticed, and the enemy who has seen him will start following him around. Moving around the map takes EN, which is also needed to use special skills. It also gradually replenished HP, unless no EN is left. As he moves around, the protagonist can pick-up items to use and equip. Equipment pieces have a durability stat (COND.). Worn items are less effective and must be repaired at the blacksmith's shop, or throw at enemies to deal damage. When an enemy is defeated, it emits a Death Cry. Any other enemy in range of the Death Cry will also notice the Unlosing Ranger and become hostile. After battle, the hero gains XP and levels-up, boosting his stats. Most dungeons have their own specific gameplay mechanics, such as cannons used to reach higher or farther places. And upon entering each dungeon, the hero's level is reseted to 1, and the gained levels add-up to his total when it is completed. At the end of each chapter, Unlosing Ranger faces against Darkdeath Evilman. Each of those battle is different, in a classic turn-based RPG style, the first being reminiscent of Dragon Quest's first-person view battles, progressing to more detailed modern battles...", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "March 11, 2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Nippon Ichi Software", "publishers": "Nippon Ichi Software", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.44", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z.H.P._Unlosing_Ranger_VS_Darkdeath_Evilman", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMEqIzM843U", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/14551-zhp-unlosing-ranger-vs-darkdeath-evilman\n"}
