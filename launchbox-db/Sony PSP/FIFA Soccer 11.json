With Personality+ a footballer's abilities on the pitch is mirrored authentically in game, creating individual personalities. Players will be distinguished from one another through a sophisticated database that evaluates and grades each player's skill-set over 36 attributes and 57 traits, compiled by 1700 scouts around the world. Real Madrid's Kaka will deliver crisp, creative passes, Barcelona's Andres Iniesta will utilize tighter turns and close control to dribble through defenses, Manchester United's Wayne Rooney will hold off defenders and strike shots from distance with pace, and top-flight defenders like Giorgio Chiellini of Juventus will anticipate, predict and react to offensive players to win back possession. Goalkeepers have also been injected with Personality+. The real-life personality of the keeper, whether acrobatic or traditional, will dictate his style in game. Dive attributes will determine the keepers with the ability to reach for further shots while reflex attributes determine reaction times, so a keeper like Petr Cech of Chelsea FC will show be able to showcase world-class skills.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "September 28, 2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Electronic Arts Canada", "publishers": "EA Sports", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.38", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0jH7_cnnvs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/15053-fifa-soccer-11\n"}
