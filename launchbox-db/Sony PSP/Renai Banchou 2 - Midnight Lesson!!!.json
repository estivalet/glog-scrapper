{"altername_name": [], "name": "Renai Banchou 2: Midnight Lesson!!!", "overview": "So following the first game, we now have a different heroine that\u2019s got love problems. Her friends tell her about the renai banchos but she\u2019s already well aware of it because she\u2019s heard of the \u201cLegendary Angel!\u201d aka the first game\u2019s protagonist. One day a flying chibi girl named Katherine gives Hiro a rainbow handkerchief saying to throw it up near a tree in the courtyard, rather than off the school rooftop like before. As she walks around confused a bunch of random guys, who she thinks are transfer students, ask her about the handkerchief but she lies saying she doesn\u2019t have it. When she gets home she runs into Koakuma Bancho who tells her to stop lying and that throwing the handkerchief during a full moon will make something good happen to her. She goes back to the school courtyard at night and throws the handkerchief and immediately gets 8 hot men at her service. As like with Mary Sue, Hiro can now pick one of them to be her boyfriend for a year to teach her the ways of love.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "January 26, 2012", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Rejet", "publishers": "Idea Factory Co., Ltd.", "genres": "Visual Novel", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/121459-renai-banchou-2-midnight-lesson\n"}
