There are a total of six new bachelors plus three secret characters. TMGS 3 implements a totally new system; the Love Triangle. Instead of rival girls liking your man, all six bachelors are paired with another, making it so that you can 'date' two of them at a time. TMGS 3 also introduces a revamped clothing system with a few new clothing styles and the ability to 'level up' your fashion.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "March 15, 2012", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Visual Novel", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/122103-tokimeki-memorial-girls-side-premium-3rd-story\n"}
