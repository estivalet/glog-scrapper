{"altername_name": ["l'entra\u00eeneur 2006 Championship Manager"], "name": "Championship Manager 2006", "overview": "The console version of Championship Manager 2006 is in many ways similar as the PC version. Players select a club from one of many different countries and play the manager's role, taking charge of tactics, training, signing new players, negotiating contracts etc. The game is very statistics heavy and assumes a fairly deep knowledge of the football game, setting it apart from its more accessible competitors. Since this version was released some months after the PC version it features updated stats to reflect changes in the leagues. Additionally it features new camera angles for viewing the playing field and a new interface more intuitive for the consoles.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "April 14, 2006", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Gusto Games", "publishers": "Eidos", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Y6DnoCHrk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/31653-championship-manager-2006\n"}
