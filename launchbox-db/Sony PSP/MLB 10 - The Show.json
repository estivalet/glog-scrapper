{"altername_name": [], "name": "MLB 10: The Show", "overview": "Sony's highly rated The Show baseball series returns with this 2010 edition. The realistic baseball simulator includes a bunch of new features and improves on many of the faults of the '09 version including online gameplay. Note that the PSP version of this game only features ad-hoc online compatibility. For the first time in the series, MLB 10: The Show lets you experience baseball through the eyes of the guy in the catcher mask. The all new Catcher mode allows you to call pitches from the backstop and control the game just like Minnesota Twins catcher Joe Mauer, the cover athlete for this edition. Homerun Derby also makes a return to the series as both a standalone mode and as an experience during the All-Star Break. Not to be forgotten is the Movie Maker mode which allows you to combine saved replays of a game to turn into a highlight reel and save to your hard drive, and also the updated Road to the Show 4.0 with new settings and stat features.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "March 2, 2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "SCE San Diego Studio", "publishers": "Sony Computer Entertainment", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLB_10:_The_Show", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90984-mlb-10-the-show\n"}
