{"altername_name": ["Musou Orochi"], "name": "Warriors Orochi", "overview": "Without warning, the venomous Serpent King Orochi descended from the heavens. Using his unworldly powers to shatter time and space, Orochi kidnapped the strongest, wisest and most courageous warriors from Ancient China and Feudal Japan in a scheme to test his might against the heroes of these ages. In Warriors Orochi, the characters from Dynasty Warriors and Samurai Warriors must team-up to wage war against this new, yet powerful force. Warriors Orochi for PSP is the first to boast the massive, seamless battlefields of the console versions -- previous games in the series for handheld platforms had combat taking place on battlefields divided into smaller \"cells\", but this game allows free roaming for realtime tactics and combat. The game also includes all 79 playable characters, and features 2-player co-op play via wireless (ad-hoc).", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "March 25, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Omega Force", "publishers": "Koei", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.58", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0JQGoYQkl8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/31702-warriors-orochi\n"}
