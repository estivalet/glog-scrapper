{"altername_name": ["Anata o Yurusanai"], "name": "Anata wo Yurusanai", "overview": "Ririko Takeuchi is a female P.I. who got into the career more by chance than by choice. Her father, Takeo Takeuchi, is an ex-cop who bought an old kindergarten and made it into a private investigation firm. Depending on the cases, players, in the role of Ririko, will be tailing suspects, searching for clues, and, having what's most important for any investigator, a bunch of internal monologues. Anata o Yurusanai is a visual novel (also described as \"sound novel\"), which mainly consists of reading text and occasionally interacting with the development of the story. The game uses the PSP in a way it wasn't meant to be used, vertically, making the visuals resemble a comic book.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "November 15, 2007", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Cavia", "publishers": "AQ Interactive", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/119625-anata-wo-yurusanai\n"}
