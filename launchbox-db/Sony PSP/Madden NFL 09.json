{"altername_name": [], "name": "Madden NFL 09", "overview": "Madden NFL 09 for PSP is another yearly update in the series. Regarding modes and options, it is very similar to its predecessor. Besides the usual roster updates, it introduces several features designed to make the game easier for beginners. All game modes of the previous year return: play now, franchise, mini-camp, practice and Superstar Challenge. The challenges have been updated and now feature situations from the 2007 season. The game introduces a Rookie Mode, which simplifies controls, reducing them to a few buttons, and also introduces prompts indicating what to press when. Also considering new players, the playcalling system has been redesigned and features basic and advanced options. Another new feature is a new defensive camera, which in a break from most football games has the camera behind the defensive line, with the offense moving toward the screen.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "August 12, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "EA Tiburon", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6803-madden-nfl-09\n"}
