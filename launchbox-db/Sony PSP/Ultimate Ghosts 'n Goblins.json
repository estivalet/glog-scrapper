{"altername_name": ["Goku Makai-Mura", "Ultimate Ghosts'n Goblins"], "name": "Ultimate Ghosts 'n Goblins", "overview": "An exclusive PSP edition of Capcom's legendary platforming game, directed by the original's creator Tokurou Fujiwara. The game makes use of a 3D graphics engine, giving depth to the visuals, but plays in a side-scrolling perspective and similar art design to stay true to the original. Your goal is to work your way through side-scrolling stages, defeating enemies and using your best platforming skills. The game lets you build up your skills as you progress. You start off with just a basic jump, but eventually gain a double jump and even the ability to fly. You'll also earn lots of magic spells along the way. The game promises a greater number of spells and weapons than ever before. New for Goku Makaimura is non-linear gameplay. You're no longer on a fixed path from start to end. The levels include branching points and even warp points. By using a warp point, you can warp back to previous levels and collecting items that you might have missed.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "August 29, 2006", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "TOSE", "publishers": "Capcom Entertainment", "genres": "Horror", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.19", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Ghosts_%27n_Goblins", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJFodbDS97Y", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/66-ultimate-ghosts-n-goblins\n"}
