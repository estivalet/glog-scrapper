{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bomberman: Bakufuu Sentai Bombermen", "overview": "Bakuf\u016b Sentai Bombermen is one of the many, many titles in Hudson's long-running bomb-blasting action series. Taking the reverse approach compared to Bomberman: Act Zero's dark, gritty rework, it reimagines Bomberman as a team of brightly-colored Power Rangers-style bomb-dropping crime-fighting sentai superheroes. The original 8-bit Bomberman also appears in full pixelated 3D glory. The game itself plays much like any other Bomberman game: Drop bombs to trap and destroy enemies, blow up crates for power-up items, avoid the various hazards on each stage, and try not to get blown up yourself. The story mode sees each member of the Bombermen team play first through several Classic stages as their blocky retro equivalent to regain their powers, then on to more dangerous Arrange stages as their sentai hero form. In Arrange modes, each Bomber has their own unique abilities: Pink Bomber, for example, can jump over blocks and other hazards with proper timing. The other single-player mode is Challenge mode. This mode is a timed race to score as many points as possible over multiple stages within a strict time limit. There is, of course, also wifi multiplayer for up to five players, and even minigames that can be played by linking with I.Q Mania and XI Coliseum. Also included are demo versions of both of these titles.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "March 9, 2006", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Sony Computer Entertainment", "publishers": "Sony Computer Entertainment", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "5", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "http://bomberman.wikia.com/wiki/Bomberman:_Bakufuu_Sentai_Bombermen", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/99856-bomberman-bakufuu-sentai-bombermen\n"}
