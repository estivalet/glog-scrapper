{"altername_name": ["Don Bluth Presents Dragon's Lair"], "name": "Dragon's Lair", "overview": "From deep within Mordroc's castle, a foul stench rose up to mix with the cold, damp midnight air; the telltale sign of the evil wizard's pet fire-breathing dragon, Singe; the reeking breath of the beast that guarded the Princess Daphne in the dark and deadly caves far below the surface. Dirk the Daring walked steadily toward the castle gate. He felt no fear. Fear was for cowards, not the most courageous knight in the land. No other would dare enter this perilous castle where Mordroc had imprisoned the helpless princess. But then, no other could match Dirk's unrelenting love for the beautiful Princess Daphne. There was no other possible course of action. Now was the time for heroes. Now was the time to enter the Dragon's Lair! A portable version of the classic FMV video game. In this single-player action game, you play as heroic knight Dirk the Daring as he journeys to a mysterious castle filled with danger, in order to save the fair Princess Daphne from the forces of evil and the towering dragon Singe. Dragon's Lair features full-motion animation directed by Don Bluth, the man behind animated films such as the Secret of Nimh and Titan AE. It takes fast reflexes and a good memory to remember the safe way through each section of the deadly castle. Do you have what it takes to guide Dirk to the end and save Princess Daphne?", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "March 29, 2011", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "United Coders", "publishers": "Digital Leisure", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.69", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/24244-dragons-lair\n"}
