{"altername_name": [], "name": "Groovin' Blocks", "overview": "Groovin' Blocks is a falling block-type puzzle game with gameplay that has been likened to Columns and Lumines. The game sees players having to clear lines of three or more blocks of the same color, and like Columns players can cycle through the falling lines of blocks, with adjacent blocks of the same color also disappearing with the matched lines. In addition, extra points can be scored when players bring their falling blocks down to the downbeats (called \"Superbeats\") of the game's electronica soundtrack, adding to a score multiplier. By setting high scores, players collect stars to unlock new songs and power-ups. Unlike most puzzle games which are played to infinity, each stage in Groovin' Blocks lasts for the duration of the song if the player has not yet failed the stage by filling their play area with blocks.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "July 12, 2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Empty Clip Studios", "publishers": "SCEA", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40311-groovin-blocks\n"}
