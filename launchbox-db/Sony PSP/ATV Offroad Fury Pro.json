{"altername_name": [], "name": "ATV Offroad Fury Pro", "overview": "ATV Offroad Fury Pro is an offroad racing game which was released alongside with ATV Offroad Fury 4. Besides the expected ATV (all-terrain vehicles) there are also a variety of other vehicles to race with, e.g. trucks or bikes, which is the foundation of the career mode: participating in a string of championships which are divided in vehicle type and difficulty. Upgrades and additional vehicles are purchased with credits which can be earned in a number of ways: besides price money for winning races, credits are also awarded for performing stunts. There are also three sponsors which offer free upgrades and/or credits for fulfilling their demands regarding performance and stunt rating, but they should be hired with caution because a big penalty is assigned for missed goals. The available types of races are Supercross, Rallycross, National, Freestyle, Circuit, Endurcross, Rally and Snowcross. Besides a basic course editor and multiplayer for up to four players (which is also the maximum number of racers in single-player) there are also connectivity features with ATV Offroad Fury 4 which allow to exchange courses/vehicles and access a shared online community.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "October 26, 2006", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Climax Studios", "publishers": "Sony Computer Entertainment America", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.06", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATV_Offroad_Fury_Pro", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwnLUxQPfCs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/21884-atv-offroad-fury-pro\n"}
