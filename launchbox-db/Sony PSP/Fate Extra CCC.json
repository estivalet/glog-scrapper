{"altername_name": [], "name": "Fate/Extra CCC", "overview": "Fate/Extra CCC is a sequel and companion game to Fate/Extra. As with its predecessor, the game was developed by Image Epoch in collaboration with TYPE-MOON. The scenario was written by Kinoko Nasu, with Takashi Takeuchi as the character designer and Arco Wada as the illustrator. The protagonist, Hakuno has to look for a way to escape from the world, together with his/her Servant. The story is told in different chapters from Caster's point of view with the chapter's title accompanied by description and picture related to the boss of the chapter. Fate/Extra CCC utilizes the same turn-based, rock-paper-scissors style combat as it's predecessor with some slight tweaks. The combat UI's appearance has changed and occupies a different place on the screen. New voice lines and animations have been added for the Servants' attacks and players can now escape from battles and the floor of the dungeon they are on.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "March 28, 2013", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Image Epoch", "publishers": "Marvelous AQL", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ids-tDT8C4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/18430-fateextra-ccc\n"}
