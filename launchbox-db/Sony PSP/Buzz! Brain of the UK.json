Brain of the UK", "overview": "Buzz!: Brain of the UK is a general knowledge quiz game about the United Kingdom in the long-running Buzz series. Instead of just translating the same questions for each country that is a part of the UK, each country's version has lots of nationally specific questions. For instance, in the British version there are questions on Eastenders or Corrie. It is part of the global Buzz!: Brain of the World brand with 21 different versions for specific countries, such as Buzz!: Brain of Oz for Australia. In addition to that localized content, Brain of the UK also retains the MyBuzz feature which enables users to create custom quizzes. All quiz packs bought on previous Buzz games are also playable in this version. The PlayStation 3 version features online play and allows users access to user created questions on the My Buzz! site as well as leaderboards that rank online play. The PSP version contains a single player game and includes the \"pass-around\" mode from the previous PSP titles in the series to enable up to 6 players to take part in the same quiz.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "March 27, 2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Curve Studios", "publishers": "Sony Computer Entertainment Europe", "genres": "Quiz", "max_players": "8", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz!:_Brain_of_the_World", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/31249-buzz-brain-of-the-uk\n"}
