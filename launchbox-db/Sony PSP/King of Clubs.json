{"altername_name": [], "name": "King of Clubs", "overview": "King of Clubs is an innovative action-puzzle game, combining the challenge of the traditional ball-rolling puzzler with the classic tacky seaside pastime of mini-golf. As an evolution of the ball-rolling puzzle genre, each level has multiple solutions, and as further equipment is unlocked, new paths through each hole become viable. Building on the great tradition of sorry-looking mini-golf courses, the game is set in a dilapidated theme-park which takes decaying kitsch to new extremes.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "March 20, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Oxygen Interactive", "publishers": "Oxygen Interactive Software", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_Clubs_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cW-ZNDtQHc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83966-king-of-clubs\n"}
