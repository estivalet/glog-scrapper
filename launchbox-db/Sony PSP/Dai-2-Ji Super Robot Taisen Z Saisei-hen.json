Despite its billing as a two-part game, Saise-hen is entirely independent of Hakai-hen. Players will receive a starting bonus in Saise-hen based on how many times they have completed Hakai-hen, along with an extra bonus for playing all of Hakai-hen's scenarios, but unlocked machines and pilots will not transfer. Every series from Hakai-hen returns, with their sequels/second seasons debuting if applicable. Macross 7 makes its Z-series debut, with Dynamite 7 appearing for the first time in any SRW. The only completely new series, Tetsujin 28, is the 1980s incarnation of a robot series that predates even Mazinger.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "April 5, 2012", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "B.B.Studio", "publishers": "Bandai Namco Games", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.38", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/45757-dai-2-ji-super-robot-taisen-z-saisei-hen\n"}
