{"altername_name": ["State Shift"], "name": "StateShift", "overview": "After an era of political unrest in the early 21st century, the world's leaders have fallen and natural resources have been depleted. This results in the downfall of the world economy and leads to a series of bloody conflicts in a world where the less fortunate strive for survival and live for one reason.... illegal racing. In StateShift, racing machines with highly advanced morphing abilities compete in illegal underground races around the world. Drivers go one on one with up to fifteen racers across nine tournaments. The titular stateshifts refer to special power-ups the player can unlock. With names such as \u00abDragster\u00bb, \u00abGhost\u00bb, \u00abMamouth\u00bb and \u00abScorch\u00bb, they can be used to drive faster or take corners more sharply, but require picking up energy cells on the tracks to recharge. The game has various modes including Career Mode to unlock new tournaments, tracks, characters and stateshifts, Time Trial, Challenges, Quick Race and various tutorials. The game also has a multiplayer mode via Wi-Fi.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "August 3, 2007", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Engine Software", "publishers": "Midas Interactive Entertainment", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj0Rs4K6DzI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/84453-stateshift\n"}
