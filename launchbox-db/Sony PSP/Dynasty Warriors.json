{"altername_name": ["Shin Sangoku Musou"], "name": "Dynasty Warriors", "overview": "Koei's Dynasty Warriors series hits the handheld market in it's first fully 3D form on the PSP. As an officer in a Chinese army (Wei, Wu or Shu armies), you fight and kill thousands of soldiers in massive battles stretched over numerous battlefields - either in the campaign \"Musou\" modes or the single battle \"Free\" mode which can be used to train. Each stage consists of a map split in numerous areas. From the map, the player selects an area he has access to (areas are connected to each other in certain directions, and the player can only move to an area connected to the one he his currently in); if the area has enemy units, a battle field similar to the ones in the main Dynasty Warriors games, albeit smaller, will load. In each areas, the enemy squads must be eliminated for the area to be liberated. When such an area is under enemy control, bonuses such as supplies that increase the remaining time to complete the stage, are acquired. As characters defeats enemies, they gain experience points and level-up. New to this PSP version is a bodyguard system where your selected second officer can give you certain items or abilities, for example one ensures you always have a horse when entering an area, and others can give you special powered up Musou attacks.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "March 16, 2005", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Omega Force", "publishers": "Koei", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.31", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynasty_Warriors_(2004_video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR1627WF0VQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/18390-dynasty-warriors\n"}
