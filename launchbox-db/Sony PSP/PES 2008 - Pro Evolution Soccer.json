{"altername_name": ["PES 2008: Pro Evolution Soccer", "World Soccer Winning Eleven Ubiquitous Edition 2008", "Pro Evolution Soccer 2008"], "name": "PES 2008: Pro Evolution Soccer", "overview": "Pro Evolution Soccer 2008 is a simulation of the soccer sport. The player can choose between numerous (partly licensed) teams and use the usual playing modes, e.g. training, cup championships or the Master League with a few additional managerial components. The main differences to Pro Evolution Soccer 2007 are a new adaptive AI for the Master League and a new animation system. This version of the game has numerous differences to the NextGen version: It lacks the ability to perform dives and to change the player wall during free kicks. In return there are a few additional features: more stadiums (33 instead of 12), matches with random players, a more extensive training mode, the World Tour mode (about 100 challenges where the player has to solve certain goals in pre-defined situations, e.g. scoring a goal in a limited time) and unique community features, e.g. a friends list or private tournaments. The latter - along with all savegames - are compatible to both the PSP and PS2 version.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "March 11, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.33", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Evolution_Soccer_2008", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/15706-pes-2008-pro-evolution-soccer\n"}
