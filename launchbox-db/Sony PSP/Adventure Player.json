{"altername_name": [], "name": "Adventure Player", "overview": "Adventure Player Studio FromSoftware is actually not a game in the classic sense of the word. This is a programming program that allows PSP users to create and exchange their own games. To take full advantage of the software's capabilities, two components are required: Adventure Player UMD Software and Memory Stick Duo. The software is sold together with three ready-made games (one of them is Echo Night - a title released by From Software on PlayStation in 1998). This program is designed to create games such as Play Novel, which are very popular in the Far East, where you can read a lot of dialogues and choose from text, while watching static graphics in the background. These are not the only possibilities - you can easily try to create a puzzle game or some kind of quiz. Players can exchange their works through the possibility of a direct connection to the console or via the Internet.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "June 30, 2005", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "FromSoftware", "publishers": "FromSoftware", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.8", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/116210-adventure-player\n"}
