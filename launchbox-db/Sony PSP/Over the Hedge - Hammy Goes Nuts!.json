When Hammy's cable television conks out, he and his friends must once again brave the dangers of suburbia to get it back. They fall in with a mischievous beaver, who keeps devising more and more daring heists to keep the food and entertainment flowing. But is he really as friendly as he seems? Playing as Hammy, RJ, and Verne, players must fight sewer rats, evade high-tech security systems, navigate suburban obstacles, slow the world down with caffeine-powered Hammy Time, steal tons of food, and ultimately save the neighborhood over the course of ten levels. The game also features 4-player multiplayer, with a set of quick-playing heist games. Players drop into a room filled with delicious food, and collect as much as they can before their opponents can get to it. If players are too slow, they're out of luck, unless they sneak up behind their opponents and smack the food right out of their hands!", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "November 21, 2006", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Amaze Entertainment", "publishers": "Activision Publishing", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.62", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCO7ixLrSvQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/44084-over-the-hedge-hammy-goes-nuts\n"}
