The game starts from the beginning of the first episode. On August 1st, 1999, 7 kids went to a summer camp. Everything was normal, until suddenly it started to snow in a middle of summer! Soon after that, there was an unusual phenomenon happening in Japan: an Aurora in the sky! These don't usually occur in Japan, so while the kids are watching the aurora, suddenly some meteorite-like things fall from the sky, that look like some virtual pet toys. Right after that, a huge water wave sucks the kids within and transports the kids to the Digital World, where they meet creatures called Digimon. The actual gameplay has typical Digimon-style battling between three Digimon on each side, with exploration and role-playing game elements as part of the game, including subquests.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "January 17, 2013", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Prope", "publishers": "Namco Bandai Games", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.32", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digimon_Adventure_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YABDTNIdIDk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/45764-digimon-adventure\n"}
