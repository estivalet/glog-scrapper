{"altername_name": [], "name": "Kud Wafter Converted Edition", "overview": "Kud Wafter (\u30af\u30c9\u308f\u3075\u305f\u30fc, Kudo Wafut\u0101) is a Japanese adult visual novel developed by Key, released on June 25, 2010, for Windows. Kud Wafter is Key's eighth game, along with other titles such as Kanon, Air, and Clannad. Key released a version of Kud Wafter without the erotic content, and the game was ported to the PlayStation Portable and PlayStation Vita. The story follows the lives of high school students Riki Naoe and his close friend Kudryavka Noumi as they start to see more of each other in a romantic relationship. The gameplay in Kud Wafter follows a branching plot line which offers pre-determined scenarios with courses of interaction, and focuses on the appeal of the title character Kudryavka, also known as \"Kud\" (\u30af\u30c9, Kudo) for short. The game is a spin-off of Key's earlier game Little Busters! rated for all ages and its expanded, adult version Little Busters! Ecstasy. Kudryavka appears as a heroine in both Little Busters! and Ecstasy. Kud Wafter is an expansion of Kudryavka's story after the events of Ecstasy and is written by Chika Shirokiri. Na-Ga and Itaru Hinoue returned as co-art directors. The game ranked as the best-selling PC game sold in Japan for the time of its release. A manga adaptation illustrated by Bakutend\u014d was serialized in ASCII Media Works' Dengeki G's Magazine. A 51-minute theatrical anime adaptation by J.C.Staff premiered on July 16, 2021.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "May 9, 2013", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Key", "publishers": "Pixel Prototype, LLC", "genres": "Visual Novel", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kud_Wafter", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165206-kud-wafter-converted-edition\n"}
