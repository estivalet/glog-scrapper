{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gift: Prism", "overview": "Gift is a story that revolves around high school student Amami Haruhiko and his strong connection to Gift's mysterious power. The town of Narasaki-chou, where Gift's story takes place, has two distinguishing characteristics: a rainbow that seems permanently fixed in the sky no matter the weather, and an ability known as Gift possessed by all its inhabitants. Gift's power can only be evoked by each person once in a lifetime, and is able to grant a single miracle. To be successful, a Gift must reflect the shared feelings of both the giver and the receiver. If the feelings are not mutual, the Gift is distorted and has the ability to wreak havoc on the surrounding area. When this happens, a black streak appears in the rainbow above town until Gift is used correctly. The story begins as Haruhiko's younger sister, Fukamine Riko, returns home after several years away. Beginning with her appearance, Haruhiko's life starts to change very quickly and feelings of the past begin to surface once more.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "February 2, 2012", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Moonstone", "publishers": "CyberFront", "genres": "Visual Novel", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/121057-gift-prism\n"}
