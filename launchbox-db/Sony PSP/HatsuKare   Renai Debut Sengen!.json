{"altername_name": [], "name": "HatsuKare * Renai Debut Sengen!", "overview": "The start of April, today is the beginning of second year in high school. During my first year, I didn\u2019t join any clubs, made a decent effort with my studies, and somehow managed to get by the year being swept away by my surroundings in a daze. But I\u2019m definitely saying no to spending a mediocre high school life until graduation. I want to be like everyone else, joining clubs, doing part-time jobs, and having hobbies. I want to challenge myself to find something that I can give my all to. And most importantly\u2026. I want to fall in love! I heard this from my friend, and it piqued my interest, the jinx that circled around Haruhino High School. If you two watch the fireworks from the \u2018Asumigaoka\u2019 that overlooks the street below, and share a kiss together, then your love will last forever. Can I fulfill this with the person I love too?", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "April 4, 2013", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Vridge", "publishers": "Furyu", "genres": "Visual Novel", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/154984-hatsukare-renai-debut-sengen\n"}
