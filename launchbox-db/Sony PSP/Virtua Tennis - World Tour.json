All popular moves are available (topspin, lob, slice, smash, serve, drop shot and aftertouch) and there are different surfaces that influence how the ball bounces and its speed. There is also a function to command the computer-controlled partner in doubles matches. In the world tour, you build a house on the world map and then travel around the globe to different events to build up your reputation. The important events are stored in the the tour calendar. You can buy new gear, purchase partner contracts and stage contracts, and improve your skills. Training is done through mini games where specific skills are tested and improved.
