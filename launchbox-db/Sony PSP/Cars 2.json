{"altername_name": ["Disney-Pixar Cars 2"], "name": "Cars 2", "overview": "Disney\u2022Pixar Cars 2 is a racing game based on the animated movie of the same name. The frame story is that Lightning McQueen and his friends are trained in C.H.R.O.M.E. missions, the races, in order to defeat Professor Zundapp. The main racing event is battle mode in which the player races against opponents and collects power-ups on the way which either allow to perform offensive (machine guns) or defensive (e.g. a shield against enemy attacks) actions as well as speed boosts. There are various other variants of battle mode, including racing against the clock or elimination races. In contrast to the console/PC version, the cars are not freely controlled: the player can only jump between the lanes. The camera angle changes automatically during the race. During the campaign the player will unlock a number of additional cars which differ in their control, power and speed ratings. Before tackling a new campaign mission, which have different difficulty levels assigned to them, the used car can be changed. The free play mode allows to choose between all racing modes.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "July 10, 2011", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "Avalanche Software", "publishers": "Disney Interactive Studios", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cars_2_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHBVDgIKweY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83952-cars-2\n"}
