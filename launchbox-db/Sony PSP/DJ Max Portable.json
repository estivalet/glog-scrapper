{"altername_name": ["DJ Max Portable International", "DJMax Portable i"], "name": "DJ Max Portable", "overview": "DJ Max Portable for the PSP is an adaptation of the online-enabled PC game DJ MAX. It follows the gameplay style established by Konami's Beatmania series, where the player is presented with a sheet of notes falling down the screen. As the notes fall, the player hits the correct key at the correct time, and in effect they play along with the music, activating key parts of the song. Unlike the PC version, which emphasizes competitive online multiplayer, DJ Max Portable is limited to being a strictly solitary experience. It features fifty tracks ranging in styles from techno to trance to dance and to some R&B music. Further extending the longevity of the game is the ability to select from a variety of difficulty levels, denoted by the number of buttons used (i.e. 4key, 6key, 8key) to play the song.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "January 14, 2006", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Pentavision Entertainment", "publishers": "Pentavision Entertainment", "genres": "Music", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.33", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DJMax_Portable", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/76251-dj-max-portable\n"}
