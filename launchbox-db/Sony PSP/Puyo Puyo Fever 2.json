{"altername_name": [], "name": "Puyo Puyo Fever 2", "overview": "A sequel to Puyo Puyo Fever, the next-gen re-imagining of the classic arcade puzzle game Puyo Puyo, in which you play against either an AI or player controlled opponent to see who can stack and arrange the falling blobs (or \"puyos\") in the correct color patterns that allow you to send \"garbage\" puyos to the opposing player and help flood him and lose. The game includes a single-player arcade mode, as well as a story mode with 3 different characters and campaigns that take you across the game world battling different sets of enemies. The \"fever\" meter from the previous game returns (which increases the number and abilities of the garbage puyos you send depending on how many puyos you chain in succession) and a new ranking system has been implemented that awards you money you can use between stages to buy special items that modify the game rules in your favor.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "November 24, 2005", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Sonic Team", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puyo_Puyo_Fever_2", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/71534-puyo-puyo-fever-2\n"}
