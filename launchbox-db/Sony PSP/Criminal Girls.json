{"altername_name": [], "name": "Criminal Girls", "overview": "In Criminal Girls, the player takes the role of a prison warden in Hell who has been assigned to a group of seven girls. Although these seven have all been damned to Hell for their sins in life, they qualify for an early release program in which they must climb a tower to earn a second chance in the realm of the living. However, they are defiant and rebellious, not wanting to do what they're told. The player must therefore whip the girls into shape, sometimes literally, in order to help them complete their rehabilitation. On their way up the tower, the girls must fight other prisoners in RPG-style battles. One of the main gameplay mechanics is Motivation, through which the girls learn new skills, gain the will to fight, and come to terms with their sins. It plays out as a minigame in which the player uses items such as whips and shock devices to destroy \"temptations\" that appear on the screen, after which they can cuddle with the girl. The minigame is accompanied by images of the chosen girl in suggestive poses.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "November 18, 2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Image Epoch", "publishers": "Nippon Ichi Software", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRxTSX34UDs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/23228-criminal-girls\n"}
