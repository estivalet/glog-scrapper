They are part of the food research club along with their friend and classmate Mifuyu. Even though it\u2019s a food research club, they don\u2019t actually do anything except for buying candy with the club budget and enjoying their time together. It is an irreplaceable place to them. However, the club\u2019s existence is in danger with one of the student council president candidates, Satsuki, vowing to close all clubs that don\u2019t do anything. Since their club is in this list, they do their best to save it but there\u2019s no other way but to participate in the student council president elections and defeat her. Yuuki is persuaded by Chisato to run in the election. At first he isn\u2019t interested at all, but since the club members are trying their hardest, he too wants to win to save the club.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "September 27, 2012", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sprite", "publishers": "Kadokawa Games", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/93469-koi-to-senkyo-to-chocolate-portable\n"}
