{"altername_name": ["Ricky Ponting 2007: Pressure Play"], "name": "Brian Lara 2007: Pressure Play", "overview": "Brian Lara 2007: Pressure Play is the first PSP incarnation of the Codemasters series of Brian Lara cricket games. It has simple controls and an arcade feel. Gameplay largely involves pressing a button at the right time to hit a shot, take a catch, return a throw, and bowl a good delivery. The 'Pressure Play' in the title refers to a new game mode that was introduced for the PSP version. Pressure Plays are essentially challenges requiring the player to complete a given task within certain defined parameters. Early Pressure Plays involve bowling no extras, or playing block shots. Later Pressure Plays involve famous run chases, holding out for rain, and hitting six sixes off an over. The game supports ad-hoc PSP multiplayer for 2 players, but does not support game sharing. Additionally, the game focuses exclusively on one-day internationals, with no option to play tests, 20-20s, or county cricket.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "August 31, 2007", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Acheron Design", "publishers": "Codemasters Software", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/18746-brian-lara-2007-pressure-play\n"}
