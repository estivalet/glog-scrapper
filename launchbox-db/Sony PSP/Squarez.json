{"altername_name": [], "name": "Squarez", "overview": "The object of Squarez is to move your blue square over green squares. When you collect a green square an enemy red square will appear. If you crash into a red square your game will be over. However, if you get the yellow powerup square, your blue square will turn purple. While in this mode you can destroy small enemy red squares by crashing into them. When your controller begins to rumble you'll be turning back to normal shortly. Your score is determined by the number of green squares you collected.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "2005", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "", "developers": "Globware", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/102650-squarez\n"}
