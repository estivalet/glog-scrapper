One day when Rika was sweeping the stairs outside the Furude shrine a box containing a pair of magical magatama (viewers of the anime will recognize them from the last episode of Higurashi no naku Koro ni Rei) fell from the sky and hit her in the head. Rika brings them to school and after the club tested them on Chie and Irie they decide to battle for the ownership of the magatama and soon the whole village is involved. Each character has two special weapons that is associated with the character in the anime and/or the early visual novel games (Keiichi has his baseball bat and Rena has of course her meat cleaver). The game features story mode and \"combat mode\". In story mode there are three story lines (and teams) available from the start and four more to unlock. In \"combat mode\" you select which characters that should battle and then set up environment and game options and then it's fight on.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "November 27, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Cavia", "publishers": "Alchemist", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/29020-higurashi-daybreak-portable\n"}
