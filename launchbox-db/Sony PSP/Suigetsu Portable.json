{"altername_name": [], "name": "Suigetsu Portable", "overview": "On a summer afternoon, I woke up in a hospital bed without any recollection of the past. I was suffering from severe amnesia, and the ones who saved me as I trembled with doubt and fear through the night were my friends and my maid, Yuki. Through their kindness, my life began once again. However, the nightmare that haunted me ever since I woke up that day continued to torment me. In my dreams was a woman with pure white skin and black hair so lustrous it seemed to fade into the dark night. And within a few weeks, on the night of the Star Festival, I would meet this beautiful girl: Makino Nanami... The girl whom I killed with my arrow each and every night.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "October 30, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "GN Software", "publishers": "GN Software", "genres": "Visual Novel", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/121809-suigetsu-portable\n"}
