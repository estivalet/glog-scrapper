{"altername_name": [], "name": "NFL Street 3", "overview": "The NFL Street Series is back. The game continues its humorous approach to NFL, like all of the various sports games in the EA BIG lineup. The game plays out as a wrestling/football game. You play as different NFL teams in backyards of different cities. The different modes include elimination, attack mode and possession-based limits. The game is very offensive minded. Other modes are exhibition, quick game, and four-on-four and open-field showdown. Visually the game includes various animations, taunts, and many touchdown poses.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "November 14, 2006", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Buzz Monkey Software", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.88", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/14002-nfl-street-3\n"}
