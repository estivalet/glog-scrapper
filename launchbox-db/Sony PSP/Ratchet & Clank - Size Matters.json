{"altername_name": ["Ratchet & Clank 5", "Ratchet & Clank 5: Gekitotsu! Dodeka Ginga no MiriMiri Gundan"], "name": "Ratchet & Clank: Size Matters", "overview": "While on a much needed vacation, Ratchet and Clank's rest and relaxation time is suddenly cut short as they soon find themselves lured into a mysterious quest. Following the trail of a kidnapped girl, Ratchet and Clank rediscover a forgotten race of genius inventors known as the Technomites, but they will soon uncover a plot more dangerous than they could have imagined. Ratchet & Clank are supplied with an all-new arsenal of upgradable weapons along with some old favorites, like the Agents of Doom, the Hypershot and the Suck Cannon. Ratchet can also collect pieces of different armor sets that can be worn and mixed at will, but equipping full sets provides useful stats like more powerful attacks or damage resistance. In addition, Ratchet's hovercraft races, Giant Clank's space battles, and Clank's battle robot arenas as minigames are all tossed into the mix with the platforming sections. Wield your big guns, put on your armor, and shrink yourself down to discover Ratchet & Clank's diminutive adventure yet!", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "February 13, 2007", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "High Impact Games", "publishers": "Sony Computer Entertainment", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.93", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratchet_%26_Clank:_Size_Matters", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F1YmmyIIxU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6817-ratchet-clank-size-matters\n"}
