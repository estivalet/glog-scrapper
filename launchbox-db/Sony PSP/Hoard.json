{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hoard", "overview": "The name says it all: the player controls a dragon, preying upon a medieval/fantasy kingdom in one of four game modes, laying waste to knights and castles and kidnapping princesses (for ransom!), all in the pursuit of more shiny shiny to decorate hoard sweet hoard with. Maps are based on user selections, with geographical particularities randomized within those parameters. The player controls the dragon with two thumbsticks, one to fly and one to direct a stream of cleansing fire emerging from the dragon's mouth -- over crops, windmills, merchant carts, archers and all sorts of targets. Winnow your target down to extinction after a few fiery gasps and all that is left in their wake is a small mound of treasure, to be collected and returned to the dragon's home base on the map, its hoard, where players can heal and upgrade one of four abilities -- Speed, Breath, Treasure Capacity, and Armor -- when not defending their gold-pile from thieves and driving off would-be princess-rescuing knights. Game modes include Treasure Hunt (a drive to maximise income in a set time limit), Princess Rush (striving to reach a set number of Princess ransoms), Survival (see how long you can survive) and Co-op.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "March 21, 2011", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Big Sandwich Games", "publishers": "Big Sandwich Games", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/84187-hoard\n"}
