{"altername_name": [], "name": "Platypus", "overview": "The big city of Collosatropolis has reached the limits of its expansion. The Collostropolan leaders have decided to solve the problem by invading the neighboring country of Mungola. Since Mungolans are simple, earthy types they don\u2019t expect much of a struggle. Mungola\u2019s defense force consists only of a single squadron of fighter planes \u2013 the F-27 Platypus. Platypus is a side-scrolling shooter, where you use your little space craft to blast the enemy ships. Shooting some formations gives the player weapon upgrades for twenty seconds. All models in the game were designed in clay, photographed and then digitally coloured. There are 20 levels in four different worlds each with their own themes and enemies. The PSP version includes minor changes. It adds worlds, ships, and enemies not in the original game, constructed from existing graphics, with new movement patterns. The weapon balancing and bonus scoring system have been changed. Enhancements include a save system, a new Survival mode and Wi-Fi multiplayer action for 2 players.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "November 14, 2006", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Idigicon", "publishers": "MumboJumbo", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.44", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVrqekGVFhc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/14366-platypus\n"}
