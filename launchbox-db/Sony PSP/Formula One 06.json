If you're a novice, switch on the improved driver and racing aids to race for fun - or turn them off for a full length GRAND PRIX experience if you're a FORMULA ONE professional. FORMULA ONE 06 features the ability to Network Play between PlayStation 2 and PSP. This means players can now compete online across platforms to see who the fastest FORMULA ONE 06 racer is. In other words, if you own the PlayStation 2 version of the game and your friend owns the PSP version, you can still compete on the same circuit!", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "July 28, 2006", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "EC - Early Childhood", "developers": "SCE Studio Liverpool", "publishers": "Sony Computer Entertainment", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NO934YsAYh8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/31502-formula-one-06\n"}
