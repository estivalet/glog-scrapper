{"altername_name": ["Lumines 2"], "name": "Lumines II", "overview": "Lumines II is the sequel to the extremely addictive puzzle-based video game, Lumines. Gamers control squares made of four smaller block pieces that are dropped into the playing field one at a time to form same-color squares. The vertical \"timeline\" sweeps across the playing field from left to right and wipes the same-color squares from the playing field. Unmatched blocks pile up, and the game ends when the pile gets to the top of the playing screen. Advance through many action-packed levels, each with its own musical theme and sound effects.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "November 6, 2006", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "Q Entertainment", "publishers": "Buena Vista Games", "genres": "Music", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.96", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumines_II", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJTE2cUy7kc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/16401-lumines-ii\n"}
