Unlike Half-Minute Hero, the sequel's episodes all consist of RPG gameplay similar to the Hero 30 mode of the original. However, they have been expanded with additional features more similar to a typical RPG, such as an explorable world, leveling outside of battle, weapon combining, formations, special classes, a more developed plot line and a home base, the Hero Castle, that doubles as a giant mecha.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "August 4, 2011", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Opus", "publishers": "Marvelous AQL", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.57", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Minute_Hero:_The_Second_Coming", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfLIvvmEJg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/79082-half-minute-hero-the-second-coming\n"}
