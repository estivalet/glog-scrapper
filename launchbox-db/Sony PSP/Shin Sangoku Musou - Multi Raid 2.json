{"altername_name": [], "name": "Shin Sangoku Musou: Multi Raid 2", "overview": "Shin Sangoku Musou Multi Raid 2 is the sequel to Dynasty Warriors: Strikeforce. The game features an original story with several fantasy elements. Shi Huangdi, a tyrannical ruler with mystical powers, has been revived. With the power to resurrect old heroes and gods at his command, he desires to create an eternal empire for himself. The heroes of the Three Kingdoms band together to stop him. Like its predecessor, this is a multiplayer-based game drawing from the Dynasty Warriors series, with significant changes to \"musou awakening\" or fury modes, and aerial combat. Rather than following the battles between the three nations of Shu, Wu, and Wei, the story of this version revolves around the resurrection of the first Qin emperor. Like Strikeforce Special, officer cards can be applied to city and fields for player benefit, as well as the ability to bring AI officers as help in single player. Players can now create quests, this and general participation with other players creates \"community points\", leading to acquisition of rare items.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "March 11, 2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Koei", "publishers": "Koei Tecmo Games", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/16011-shin-sangoku-musou-multi-raid-2\n"}
