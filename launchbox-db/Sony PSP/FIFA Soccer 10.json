{"altername_name": ["FIFA 10", "FIFA 10: World Class Soccer"], "name": "FIFA Soccer 10", "overview": "Last year's game topped the league and now the all-new FIFA 10 is looking to defend its title as the number one football action game. More realistic than ever, this latest sequel has greatly improved artificial intelligence, ball physics and graphics. Brand new this year is the 360 degree dribbling system, giving you the most precise control ever. There are also changes to how the defensive line is formed, as well as improvements to crosses, freekicks and goalkeepers (who can now receive red cards). Naturally the game retains its hugely successful on and offline multiplayer modes, with new options and better stability for online play. The manager mode has also seen a massive update to make it just as deep and complex as the main game. With all these new features and more EA Sports are betting on FIFA remaining the champions for a long time to come.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "October 20, 2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Electronic Arts Canada", "publishers": "EA Sports", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7I_qn69_WY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/31233-fifa-soccer-10\n"}
