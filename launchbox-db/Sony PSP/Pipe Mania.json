{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pipe Mania", "overview": "Alfonso Senior, having made his fortune from the original Pipe Mania, has retired to Paradise Island. Unfortunately, the island has an alarmingly high number of plumbing-related problems. Alfonso's retired, but he's called in his kids Junior and Fawcett to fix up the island, and maybe learn a few things about plumbing along the way. Gameplay is similar to the classic Pipe Dream/Pipe Mania, but with a more mission-based structure, and more unusual modes. Missions can be replayed to get a higher grade, and high grades can unlock various treasures, such as movies, character bios, and new game modes. Pipe Mania even has a multiplayer mode; compete against a friend for points, or use your attacks to damage your opponent's pipes.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "September 26, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Razorworks", "publishers": "Empire Interactive Europe", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsWgoKTA9mU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90955-pipe-mania\n"}
