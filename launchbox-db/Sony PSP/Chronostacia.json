{"altername_name": [], "name": "Chronostacia", "overview": "\"There are only 99 days left until the world ends. I wonder who I'll be with when I hear the last grain of sand fall\u2014\u2014\" Watched over by the \"Giant Hourglass of The World Tree\", the grand capital of Albion boasts great splendour. 10 years ago, by means of the \"Time Revolution\", methods to control and manage time propagated. All humans gave their time to \"BANK\", the time bank, to look after, or sold their time and rejoiced in lives of luxury. Before humanity knew it, \"time\" was no longer something that was \"irreplaceable\". 17-year-old Lucia (the protagonist) has no memory of her childhood. Even so, she lives a fun and quiet life helping her uncle out at his caf\u00e9. One day, big news began to spread throughout the capital like a wildfire... \"The time that was stored in BANK was stolen by an unknown organization. There's only 99 days left until the world ends!\" As the city's lively atmosphere was slowly changing to that of bewilderment and confusion, Lucia happens upon \"a small hourglass\". After the hourglass sheds a faint light in her hands, it gifts her with a certain power. That power is to stop time with her thoughts, \"Chronostasis\". The story comes to life in a city with an atmosphere like that of after a lively festival, coupled with the feelings of Lucia and her \"precious somebody\".", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "April 24, 2014", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Idea Factory", "publishers": "Idea Factory", "genres": "Visual Novel", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/154933-chronostacia\n"}
