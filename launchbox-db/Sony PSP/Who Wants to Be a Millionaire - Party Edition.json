{"altername_name": [], "name": "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire: Party Edition", "overview": "It's time to ask once again, Who Wants to be a Millionaire? This 2006 entry in the series (based on the original UK show) reinvents the series with a new cast of crazy characters, new game modes and a more complete multiplayer game. The challenge, as always, is to answer 15 questions to win a million, using your Life Lines to get yourself through the tough questions if you think you need help. Now you get to choose your on-screen contestant from 16 unique and eager contestants in an authentic Millionaire experience hosted by Chris Tarrant. Up to four people can compete in the multiplayer, which is now bursting with options including a quick fire round, Millionaire party and a play or pass mode in which you can pass difficult questions over to another player. There are 4,000 brand new questions in this version, plus there is an added feature where players who bag the big Millionaire pound prize are given a code they can enter on the game's website, so they can brag about their feat with other virtual millionaires.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "December 1, 2006", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Climax", "publishers": "Eidos Interactive", "genres": "Quiz", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.58", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuajPEkhfxY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/45418-who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-party-edition\n"}
