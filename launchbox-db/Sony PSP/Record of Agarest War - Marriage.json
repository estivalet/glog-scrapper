{"altername_name": ["Agarest Senki Mariage"], "name": "Record of Agarest War: Marriage", "overview": "Agarest Senki Mariage is a spin-off of the Record of Agarest War series. Unlike other games in the series, it is not an SRPG, but instead a more traditional Japanese-style role-playing game with a battle system, similar to the conditional turn-based battle system in Final Fantasy X. Characters are assigned to one of the four roles: Attacker, Defender, Supporter or Conductor, and they gain experience in that role in addition to the regular experience. Through Reinforcement, characters can further improve theirs stats as well as learn new skills, by spending special items and money. Special items and gold can be used to craft new armor via Composition. Affection with heroines can be improved by using group skills in battles, talking to them in the inn or by playing a ceremony mini-game. Mariage replaces Soul Breeding with Honeymoon system, which allows you to experience the newly-married life in the game after marrying the heroine. Offsprings' gender is no longer limited to males and girls also could be born by satisfying specific conditions. The offspring's stats are affected by gender as well as by the heroine's affection level.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "July 19, 2012", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Felistella", "publishers": "Compile Heart", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/18415-record-of-agarest-war-marriage\n"}
