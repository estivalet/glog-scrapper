{"altername_name": [], "name": "Thrillville", "overview": "Thrillville allows gamers of all ages to easily build and customize the coaster of your dreams. Gone are the days of the complex PC techniques used in other coaster games. Rather, Thrillville's easy to use building mode has been designed specifically for the console platforms and makes building all 75-plus rides from wooden, corkscrew and inverted coasters to merry go rounds, trains and carnival rides, easy, and most importantly, fun. Imagination is the only height limit with Thrillville, where the fun ranges from racing on go-kart tracks you put together and playing mini-golf on courses you designed to joining friends for dozens of four-player party games, from bumper cars to arcade shoot-'em-ups. You can also tour the park on foot - a first for theme-park titles - chatting and joking with all the guests to help them out and make sure they're enjoying themselves.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "November 21, 2006", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "Frontier Developments", "publishers": "LucasArts", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.2", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrillville", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/79094-thrillville\n"}
