{"altername_name": ["Corpse Party: Blood Covered - Repeated Fear", "\u5c38\u4f53\u6d3e\u5bf9"], "name": "Corpse Party", "overview": "Corpse Party is an adventure game that uses hand-drawn 2D sprite and tile art to tell the story of a group of Kisaragi Academy High School students who are trapped in a haunted elementary school filled with the decaying corpses and tormented souls of countless children whod mysteriously vanished from the Japanese countryside years, months or sometimes only days prior. Desperately trying to escape and survive, players will experience unnatural, unnerving and decidedly uncensored horrors through the eyes and ears -- of these frightened teenaged victims. Detailed 2D sprite animations and art stills show the bloody and unsettling fates that await those who enter, and full Japanese-language voice-acting combines with 3D audio support to create a simulated surround sound experience when playing with headphones, offering players a delightfully uncomfortable level of immersion.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "November 22, 2011", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "M - Mature", "developers": "Team GrisGris", "publishers": "Xseed Games", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/16394-corpse-party\n"}
