The daughter of the demon king Janes, the half-demon-half-human Hiro, commands the Kingdom of Neverland. The game is a strategy war game with RPG elements. You can choose to fight for one of the several kingdoms that take part in the war. You send your troops to attack other kingdoms or to defend your own, and manage large strategic battles. Each action in battle requires action points (AP). You can also use the Hold command, which will allow chain attacks performed by several party members together. Your characters level up after battles and completed missions, and you can freely distribute their experience points to upgrade their skills and to create your own ones. You can also mix and enhance items in special facilities.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "September 26, 2006", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "HyperDevbox Japan", "publishers": "NIS America", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnW18AlFUmY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/13619-spectral-souls-resurrection-of-the-ethereal-empires\n"}
