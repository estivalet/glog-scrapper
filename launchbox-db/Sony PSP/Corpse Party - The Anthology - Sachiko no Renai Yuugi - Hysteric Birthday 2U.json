Sure, she may have reacted by becoming a bloodthirsty, vengeful spirit responsible for the deaths of countless other children, as well as their erasures from history, but everyone knows that in her heart of hearts, she\u2019s just an ordinary, innocent little 7-year-old\u2026right? Well, no. Because you see, today is her birthday! She\u2019ll be turning\u20267 again, naturally. But in celebration, she\u2019s decided to grant all her victims 24 hours of amnesty from their suffering by gathering them all together for a\u2026hysteric? birthday bash. There will be party games, entertainment, adventure, and most of all, romance! Join Sachiko and the lovable cast of damned souls from previous Corpse Party games\u2014along with a few new faces\u2014as they take the very concept of genre and toss it aside. Prepare to experience terror, discomfort, joviality, and confusion in equal measure as Heavenly Host Elementary plays less-than-heavenly host to cooking contests, co-ed mixers, interpretive stage drama, traditional party games, and Lovecraftian horrors alike. Because you know what they say: Hell hath no fury like a 7-year-old girl bored\u2026 A (surprisingly) canonical \u201cmidquel\u201d to Corpse Party and Corpse Party: Book of Shadows, taking place sometime during the course of those games, Corpse Party: Sweet Sachiko\u2019s Hysteric Birthday Bash recounts the bizarre events of vengeful ghost girl Sachiko Shinozaki\u2019s one-of-a-kind birthday party held in the otherworldly school where so many lives have been lost in previous games: Heavenly Host Elementary. The game plays out as a visual novel, divided into eight main chapters that each detail a different activity or cluster of activities. Player decisions determine which of the game\u2019s endings is attained, with only one true ending from each chapter leading into the next. Surviving to the end will require thinking like Sachiko and making the choices that will please her the most\u2026but with the fewest casualties.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "August 2, 2012", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "5pb.", "publishers": "5pb.", "genres": "Visual Novel", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.6", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/93493-corpse-party-the-anthology-sachiko-no-renai-yuugi-hysteric-birthday-2u\n"}
