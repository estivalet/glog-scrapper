{"altername_name": [], "name": "Macross Ace Frontier", "overview": "This game is based in the Macross franchise. Although the game is named after Macross Frontier, all current Macross series (with the exception of Macross II: Lovers Again) are included. Players create two pilots (a main pilot and a wingman) and fight in the many memorable battles of the Macross timeline. The developers, Artdink, are also known for the Gundam Battle PSP series. Macross Ace Frontier uses a slightly modified version of the Gundam Battle engine, and therefore has many notable similarities to Gundam Battle Universe.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "October 9, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "ArtDink", "publishers": "Bandai Namco Games", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.58", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/29026-macross-ace-frontier\n"}
