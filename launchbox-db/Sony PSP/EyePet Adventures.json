{"altername_name": [], "name": "EyePet Adventures", "overview": "EyePet Adventures is the second game in the EyePet series for the PSP. The basic concept is the same: by pointing the PSP with the PSP camera attached on the 'magic card' the player can interact with a cute pet - play mini-games, feed and wash it, customize its appearance. The added features include the new Explorer Club mode - the player controls a submarine-like transport (called EyePet Explorer Craft) with the pet inside exploring the 2D-scrolling environments for treasure and customization items. The creature's new home and customization area is located inside this EyePet Explorer Craft.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "November 11, 2011", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "SCEE Studio London", "publishers": "Sony Computer Entertainment Europe", "genres": "Life Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/91202-eyepet-adventures\n"}
