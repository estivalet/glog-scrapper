But as you uncover the proof that you've been targeting the wrong enemy you must find a way to put a stop to a full scale war before it happens. Similar to other Ghost Recon games, you play with over-the-shoulder camera, and can choose to be stealthy or enter the combat guns-blazing.

As you progress, you will gather experience points which allows you to upgrade your ghosts.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "November 16, 2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Virtuos", "publishers": "Ubisoft", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "3", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.07", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Clancy's_Ghost_Recon_Predator", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Ee-1-HtVM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27796-tom-clancys-ghost-recon-predator\n"}
