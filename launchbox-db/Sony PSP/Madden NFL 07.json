{"altername_name": [], "name": "Madden NFL 07", "overview": "With the exclusive video game license of the NFL and its players, and currently in its 17th installment, Madden NFL 07 puts you in control the running game like never before. For the first time ever, step up as the lead blocker to create a hole, and then take control of the tailback and smash through, overpower, or slash away from would-be tacklers as you fight for every yard. Innovative rushing controls give you a game-breaking ground attack featuring all-new jukes, cutbacks, and the distinct running styles of your favorite backs. The game adds some of the new control options introduced in the console versions, including the Hit Stick (toggled on the PSP via the triangle button) and Lead Blocker Control. The main game modes are unchanged from the previous year and include \"play now\" quick games, wi-fi multiplayer, mini-camp and franchise (still without Owner Mode or Storyline Central, but with the exclusive Assistant Coach mode). The PS2 connectivity option now allows to transfer entire franchise seasons between PSP and PS2. A new addition is the mini game \"End 2 End\". In this mode, the PSP is held vertically. A runner moves towards the end zone and faces a number of tacklers. Upon noticing the direction the tackler is going in, the player must respond by hitting the correct direction button in time to evade. Score is given for quick reaction and multiple evasions in a row. Reaching high scores in this mode unlocks music tracks and hidden teams.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "August 22, 2006", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Team Fusion", "publishers": "EA Sports", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXaMhAP5jPs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/15312-madden-nfl-07\n"}
