{"altername_name": [], "name": "Namco Museum", "overview": "This is the first Namco Museum title to use actual arcade roms to run the games through emulation, which is done fairly good here. It also includes its own Arrangement titles, although they have nothing to do with their 1990s counterparts seen in the previous Namco Museum title. You also can play with others, or share a game with another using the Ad-Hoc mode on the PSP to wirelessly transmit a demo of one game, or play together in multiplayer, although playing multiplayer requires two copies of the game.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "February 24, 2005", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Namco", "publishers": "Namco", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/129987-namco-museum\n"}
