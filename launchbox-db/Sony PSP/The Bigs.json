{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Bigs", "overview": "The BIGS is an arcade-style baseball game that is less focused on the intricate details of the game and more on the actual gameplay, proven by the inclusion of power-ups and turbos during gameplay. All 30 teams from MLB and their stadiums are included, as well as their player rosters. Instead of a traditional season mode as in many other baseball simulations, in The BIGS there is a mode titled Rookie Challenge, where the player creates a ballplayer and tries to lead him and his team to the World Series. Another mode, Home Run Pinball, puts a hitter in the middle of Times Square, New York, with the aim to hit balls into windows and neon lights.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "June 26, 2007", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Blue Castle Games", "publishers": "2K Sports", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.83", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bigs", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/74920-the-bigs\n"}
