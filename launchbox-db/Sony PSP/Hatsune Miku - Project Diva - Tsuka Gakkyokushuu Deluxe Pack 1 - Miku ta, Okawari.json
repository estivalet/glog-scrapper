It also gives you a Miku theme you can use with your PSP. The first option leads you to three more options. The first option of these is to download the mp3s for the edit data. You can get one at a time or go all the way down to get all of them at once. The second option of these lets you download the edit data. I\u2019m not sure what the third option does. It may import the edits to Project Diva. The second option lets you play the Miku platformer. The third option lets you watch PVs of the included dlc edit data.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "April 2, 2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Music", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162482-hatsune-miku-project-diva-tsuka-gakkyokushuu-deluxe-pack-1-miku-ta-okawari\n"}
