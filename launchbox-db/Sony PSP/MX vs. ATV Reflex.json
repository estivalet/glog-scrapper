{"altername_name": [], "name": "MX vs. ATV Reflex", "overview": "MX vs. ATV Reflex marks the highly anticipated return of the best-selling off-road racing franchise and features the all-new Rhythm Racing 2.0 physics engine, Rider Reflex control system and real-time terrain deformation. The Rider Reflex control system provides unparalleled precision and fluidity by separating machine steering from body positioning, which allows the independently controlled rider to shift his weight, perform death-defying stunts and avoid potentially devastating wrecks. Unprecedented terrain deformation creates ever-changing courses as off-road vehicles carve lines and deep ruts that have a real-time impact on gameplay and remain persistent through the full length of each race.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "December 1, 2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Tantalus Interactive", "publishers": "THQ", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN69i4gN4vk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/15427-mx-vs-atv-reflex\n"}
