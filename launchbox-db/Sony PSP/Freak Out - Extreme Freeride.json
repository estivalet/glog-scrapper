The main mode is Mission, where players need to jump gaps, make tricks, grind rails and pick stars. Completing the different challenges is rewarded with money, exchanged for basic equipment (skis, boots, helmets) and style equipment (jackets, goggles, gloves) at the shop. It also opens up new slopes and mountains. In Freeride the aim is to get the highest score, opening up slopes and mountains, there are four mountains in total, and earning endurance points. Bone Ride has the player collect bones against a time limit to earn balance points and beating courses in the Slope Style mode requires the player to reach a pre-defined score to receive trick skill points. These different game modes are grouped in the main Career, Single race and Multiplayer sections. Mostly about tricks, players need to take care of their landings - touch the ground with back, front or side weight and a lower score multiplier is awarded. Next to the basic information on the screen such as time, score and stunts, the game also keeps track of your \"flow\", by doing consecutive tricks. There are six different characters and the arsenal of tricks includes flips, rolls, carve/cross skis, grabs, rails, jumps and specials.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "October 26, 2007", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "ColdWood Interactive", "publishers": "JoWooD Productions Software", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freak_Out:_Extreme_Freeride", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DT8wm6ICBRI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/84062-freak-out-extreme-freeride\n"}
