{"altername_name": [], "name": "Legends of War: Patton's Campaign", "overview": "Legends of War: Patton's Campaign is a Spanish-made turn-based tactics game. As the title suggests, the game follows historical battles of General Patton and his 3rd Army in World War II, leading you from France to Berlin. The game consists of two parts: managing your troops between battles by spending money or experience to acquire new troops, level up veteran troops or increase your \"Patton's skills\" to gain combat bonuses and the missions itself, the completion of which gives you a certain amount of points depending on how well you did. There are several mission types: Attack, Infiltration, Defense, Sabotage and Escort. The troops you have span from simple infantry soldiers to Rangers, snipers and even tanks and aircrafts. Each unit has a certain, separate amount of points for movement and attack. Also, each unit has two kinds of attacks and some troops like the commandos also have a context-sensitive attack (e.g. knife stealth-kill).", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "October 20, 2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Enigma Software Productions", "publishers": "Enigma Software Productions", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/110607-legends-of-war-pattons-campaign\n"}
