{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bleach: Heat the Soul 5", "overview": "Bleach: Heat the Soul 5 is the fifth installment in the Heat the Soul series based on Tite Kubo's Bleach, released on May, 15th 2008 in Japan. Like previous installments it picks off where the other Heat The Soul left off, the story picks up from the entry of Hueco Mundo to the encounter between Grimmjow and Ichigo. New features include a \"Tag Action\" system and a new way for releasing zanpakuto. Transformations such as Bankai are now made when 2 bars of reiatsu is obtained and then pressing the L button, rather than selecting a character's Bankai form before a fight. There also seems to be 3 styles of tag action: offensive, defensive and technical. There is also a game mode called Tag Master, which lets you choose 2 characters to fight with in a series of fights. The system also includes specials which use the tagged partner's abilities. The game features 32 characters usable in Tag Battle mode, while extra characters can be obtained with Bleach: Heat The Soul 4 game save through game conversion. However, these characters are only usable in single mode with no in-game transformation. They are selected through a separate menu accessible by pressing L/R in the normal character menu.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "May 15, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Eighting", "publishers": "Sony Computer Entertainment", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.54", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/45760-bleach-heat-the-soul-5\n"}
