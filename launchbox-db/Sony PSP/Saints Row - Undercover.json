{"altername_name": ["Saints Row: The Fall"], "name": "Saints Row: Undercover", "overview": "This game started as a port of Saints Row 2. After realizing that the limitations of the platform would not allow for a complete port of the game, it was decided that it would be a new story, first named as \"Saints Row: The Fall\" and later as \"Saints Row: Undercover. Unlike the rest of the series where you play one of the gang members, Saints Row: Undercover starred an undercover cop joining the 3rd Street Saints under orders of Commissioner Bradshaw in order to stop a civil war inside the Saints that was tearing Stilwater apart. The game was eventually scrapped after THQ and Volition reviewed a build of the game and felt that the game so far did not properly hold up to the quality of the series.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mass Media", "publishers": "THQ", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.83", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saints_Row#Cancelled_games", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/47420-saints-row-undercover\n"}
