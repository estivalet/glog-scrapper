Shiseikan", "overview": "AnotherSky allows players to view the narrative from one of the three main rival schools introduced in the third title. The protagonist's introduction changes with each entry. The protagonist has finished playing at a concert with a lackluster performance. Her grandfather notices her artistic slump and consoles her to reconsider her love for music. He advises the protagonist to live with her mother for a change of pace. As she broods in Sendai's streets, the protagonist spontaneously overhears Arata's trombone and joins him for a live duo. He leaves after their performance, casually stating his club name and high school before disappearing. Feeling invigorated by the experience, the protagonist decides to enroll at Shiseikan High School.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "March 27, 2014", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Koei Tecmo Games", "publishers": "Koei Tecmo Games", "genres": "Visual Novel", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/155005-kiniro-no-corda-3-another-sky-feat-shiseikan\n"}
