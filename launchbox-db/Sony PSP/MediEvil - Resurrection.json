{"altername_name": [], "name": "MediEvil: Resurrection", "overview": "MediEvil: Resurrection is an enhanced and altered version of MediEvil. While the overall storyline remains the same, the design of some characters and locations has been changed to have a slightly more comical edge. A few locations have been removed completely, and the layout of several others has been changed significantly. A few plot-related sections that were not present in the original release appear in this version, e.g. a sub-plot involving the Anubis Stone. Voice acting has been added. Unlike the original, there is no alternate ending in this version: the protagonist reaches the Hall of Heroes even if the player did not manage to collect all the chalices.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "September 13, 2005", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "SCEE", "publishers": "SCEA", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.35", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediEvil:_Resurrection", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFBq3CwTq8M&ab_channel=MrSlayer4601", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6805-medievil-resurrection\n"}
