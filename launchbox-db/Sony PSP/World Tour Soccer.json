{"altername_name": ["World Tour Soccer: Challenge Edition"], "name": "World Tour Soccer", "overview": "World Tour Soccer: Challenge Edition (WTS; known simply as World Tour Soccer in the United States) is the PlayStation Portable version of the popular PlayStation and PlayStation 2 game This Is Football (TIF), created by SCEE's London Studio and released in 2005. WTS featured very similar gameplay as TIF but was not a direct port of its forerunner as a number of areas were enhanced - particularly the challenge mode referred to in its title. WTS has emulated TIF's success by selling over half a million copies in PAL territories. As a result of its success, a sequel to WTS was developed by SCEE and released as World Tour Soccer 06 in 2006.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "March 14, 2005", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "", "publishers": "Sony Computer Entertainment America", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.38", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6830-world-tour-soccer\n"}
