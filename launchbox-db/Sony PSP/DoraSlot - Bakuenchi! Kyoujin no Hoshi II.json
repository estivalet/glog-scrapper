{"altername_name": ["Doraslot: Kyojin no Hoshi 2"], "name": "DoraSlot: Bakuenchi! Kyoujin no Hoshi II", "overview": "Dora-Slot: Kyojin no Hoshi II, is a Pachislot game based on real machines. The theme of the game is based on Japanese manga/anime series Star of the Giants. The main game consists of 3 different variants of the slot machines, which feature two side bars that interact based on how you score and if you activate any bonuses or meet certain conditions. These feature characters from the series, with voice acting and Japanese humor. The library allows users to play with the sounds and music, view a catalog about the machine, or even view the staging for various transitions without playing through the game repeatedly. Although, it's still up to luck if you'll complete it, you can hear the voice acting and see the effects that the machine uses in this mode. Pachislot games are a cross between pachinko machines and western style slot machines. They play more like western style machines, although they often feature mechanical enhancements, animations, mini-games, and various ways of getting bonuses that are more complex than other some other machines.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "July 28, 2005", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Dorart", "publishers": "Dorart", "genres": "Casino", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/120986-doraslot-bakuenchi-kyoujin-no-hoshi-ii\n"}
