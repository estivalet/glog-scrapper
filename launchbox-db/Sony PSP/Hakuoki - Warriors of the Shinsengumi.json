{"altername_name": ["Hakuouki: Bakumatsu Musou Roku"], "name": "Hakuoki: Warriors of the Shinsengumi", "overview": "After 260 years of samurai rule, the shogunate's hold on the country began to weaken as men ostensibly loyal to the emperor began to sow chaos and dissent throughout the nation. The Shinsengumi was formed to combat this rising tide of violence, and to protect the shogun and the people from dangerous ronin. As the country inches close to all-out war, Chizuru travels to Kyoto to find her missing father. She encounters both danger and the Shinsengumi, in quick succession. After learning that the Shinsengumi are also looking for her father, Chizuru goes under their protection. However, they soon find themselves in the midst of political intrigue, supernatural power struggles, and much more as they search desperately for the answer they need.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "February 19, 2013", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "M - Mature", "developers": "Idea Factory", "publishers": "Aksys Games", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/16398-hakuoki-warriors-of-the-shinsengumi\n"}
