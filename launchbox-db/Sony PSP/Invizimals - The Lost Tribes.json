{"altername_name": [], "name": "Invizimals: The Lost Tribes", "overview": "Invizimals allows players to interact with their environment, using the PSP Camera to look for invisible creatures that lurk around every corner. Using the PSP on-screen sensor, players can track down the mysterious Invizimals and lay down magical traps to capture as many of them as possible. The third game in the series, Invizimals: The Lost Tribes picks up from where Invizimals Shadow Zone left off, with you as the Hero trying to find Keni after he disappeared into the Shadow Zone. If you're new to the franchise, the game adapts the story to allow you to begin a new adventure with Jasmin, Alex and the gang. The Lost Tribes includes all of the features that have made Invizimals such a well-loved franchise in Europe, with Novarama's augmented reality technology enabling you to literally hunt down, capture, battle, customize and trade the magical monsters living in the world all around you. This time around there will be 150 Invizimals, with 70 brand new Invizimals and 80 of the community's favorite Invizimals from the previous titles for you to capture, train, and battle. Players can also engage in Tag Team Battle mode, where you can fight 2 vs 2 Invizimals, allowing for even more dynamic battles and tactical gameplay than ever before!", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "September 23, 2014", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "Novarama", "publishers": "Sony Computer Entertainment", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giL1aRRMr2g", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27794-invizimals-the-lost-tribes\n"}
