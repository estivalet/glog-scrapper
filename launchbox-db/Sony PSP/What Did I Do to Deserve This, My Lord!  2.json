{"altername_name": ["Holy Invasion of Privacy, Badman! 2: Time To Tighten Up Security!", "Yuusha no Kuse ni Namaikida Or 2"], "name": "What Did I Do to Deserve This, My Lord!? 2", "overview": "Become the God of Destruction! Build a thriving natural ecosystem, a twisting, tunneling dungeon underneath the earth, and fill it with hordes of terrible monsters to protect the evil overlord, Badman. Ensure that he is safe from armies of nasty humans, eager to ransack the place, steal your loot, and prevent Badman from taking over the world! Holy Invasion of Privacy, Badman! is a strategy game in the vein of the Bullfrog game, Dungeon Keeper. Players use their pickaxe to dig deep into the earth to protect the villain, Badman, from harm. Their goal is to create monsters by digging up nutrient-filled blocks, which produce monsters. The more nutrients inside the block, the more powerful the monster is. By creating all sorts of powerful monsters, you'll increase your 'Battle Power', which indicates how powerful Badman's entire army is. Players only have a limited amount of 'Dig Power' available. After this runs out, they cannot dig through the earth any more, and must rely on the monsters to take care of the dungeon. More Dig Power can be earned for each level by not using all the Dig Power you were given, or by earning bonus Dig Power at the end of the level.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "October 16, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Acquire", "publishers": "Nippon Ichi Software", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.69", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Did_I_Do_to_Deserve_This,_My_Lord%3F_2", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/23691-what-did-i-do-to-deserve-this-my-lord-2\n"}
