{"altername_name": ["X-Men Origenes: Lobezno"], "name": "X-Men Origins: Wolverine", "overview": "X-Men Origins: Wolverine will give you new insight into how much damage indestructible, razor-sharp claws can do to a human body. This is a game that revels in gore, with decapitations, eviscerations, and mutilations drenching the screen in blood. It may be derivative, a cakewalk, and at times buggy, but the sheer visceral impact of the over-the-top violence in X-Men Origins is enough to make it a fun action game, as well as one of the better movie tie-ins released recently.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "May 1, 2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Griptonite Games", "publishers": "Activision", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.62", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men_Origins:_Wolverine_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vz72kurwjIo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/29513-x-men-origins-wolverine\n"}
