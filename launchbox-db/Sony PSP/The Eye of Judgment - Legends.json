{"altername_name": ["The Eye of Judgment: Shintaku no Wizard"], "name": "The Eye of Judgment: Legends", "overview": "The Eye of Judgment: Legends is a spin-off of The Eye of Judgment. The biggest difference is that Legends is a digital card game and does not make use of a camera during the game to bring the animations to life. It contains all the cards of the original game (over 300) and using the PSP online functions you can challenge people worldwide. It is also possible to trade cards with other players through ad hoc mode and infrastructure mode. For Legends a completely new, single-player story mode was created. The card game itself has the exact same rules as the original The Eye of Judgment.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "March 10, 2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "Sony Computer Entertainment Japan", "publishers": "Sony Computer Entertainment", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.9", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eye_of_Judgment:_Legends", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQzuTjgFSOg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/45765-the-eye-of-judgment-legends\n"}
