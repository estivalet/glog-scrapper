{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gran Turismo", "overview": "The game is centered on an open-ended design. The single-player menu presents players with three variables \u2014 Mode Selection (Time Trial, Single Race, and Drift Trial), Car Selection, and Track Selection. The player can pick and choose circuits and vehicles, with credits earned based on the difficulty, performance and number of laps they have chosen. Players can select from any number of laps, one to 99. There are 45 tracks (including layout variations) plus the added bonus of reverse on most tracks, which takes the track number close to 75. For the first time in the series, the game features the use of custom soundtracks that enables players to play their own songs while racing, but this option must first be unlocked by completing section B of the Driving Challenges. The music tracks can only be played if it is set on \"MUSIC folder\" and can be used for offline or online races.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "October 1, 2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Polyphony Digital", "publishers": "Sony Computer Entertainment", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.01", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gran_Turismo_(2009_video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgMqu20t4pQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/13623-gran-turismo\n"}
