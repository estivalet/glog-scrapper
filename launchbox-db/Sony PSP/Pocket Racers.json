{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pocket Racers", "overview": "An evil magician crashes a teenagers' party, uses his powers to load all their cars on his trailer and transform them into miniature cars themselves. The friends Hannah, Claire, Vicky, Roger and Mitch need to free themselves by racing pocket cars on tracks, where winning races is awarded with soul gems and soul shards that can return them to their human form. Races are grouped together in different soul challenges with identical gameplay but different settings such as a garden or a bathroom. Since the cars are very small, the roads are loaded with huge items such as bottles and everyday appliances. The tracks have short-cuts, jumps and slopes, as well power-ups that destroy the environment, provide rockets or freeze the opponent's car. There are four camera perspectives (all third-person) and a button to reset the car when straying away from the track. Next to the soul races there are time trial and practice modes. The car park has many vehicle models with different statistics, liveries and decals. Most of these still need to be unlocked at the start of the game. Aside from single-player games, there are online play modes with game modes as race, soccer, and domination.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "September 15, 2006", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Blade Interactive Studios", "publishers": "Konami Computer Entertainment", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r_Q8kmW1ts", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83938-pocket-racers\n"}
