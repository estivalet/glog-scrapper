{"altername_name": ["LocoRoco: Midnight Carnival"], "name": "LocoRoco Midnight Carnival", "overview": "Midnight Carnival is a spin off of the LocoRoco games, and forms a sequel to LocoRoco 2 and was released as a halloween special. LocoRoco BuiBui, a red, sinister version of MuiMui, pulls on a nearby star which opens a trapdoor over a chute and into a cannon which sends LocoRoco into the titular Midnight Carnival that was designed by BuiBui as a secret base, and also gives LocoRoco the new \"boing\" power. It is now up to you to get out. Gameplay is unchanged from previous LocoRoco games, you still have to roll along by tilting and bouncing your way over walls and climbing up walls. Each stage of the game tracks both your score and time progress. You can now dress up your LocoRoco. Multiplayer comes in the form of four player ad-hoc games, which can be played over any of the single player levels.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "October 29, 2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "SCE Japan Studio", "publishers": "Sony", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.09", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mKVqGi0Krs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/48007-locoroco-midnight-carnival\n"}
