One day, her magic suddenly disappears and her father, the king, says it must be because her mother was human. Aspashia learns that in order to get her magic back, she must travel down to earth and grant the wishes of humans. By granting small wishes, she will get a small amount back, but in order to get a large amount back, she must grant true, large wishes. However, people keep these wishes secret, so it will take time for her to figure them out, time that she can\u2019t use to grant small wishes. Aspashia has a limited amount of time to get all her magic back, or she\u2019ll have to remain on earth as a human for the rest of her life.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "February 21, 2013", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Design Factory", "publishers": "Idea Factory", "genres": "Visual Novel", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/18422-desert-kingdom-portable\n"}
