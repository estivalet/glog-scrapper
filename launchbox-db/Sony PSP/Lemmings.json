{"altername_name": [], "name": "Lemmings", "overview": "Controlling an army of lemmings, the aim is to get as many of these cute characters as you can from the entrance point to the exit point of a level within a time limit. Easy to learn, difficult to master; Lemmings is a test of strategy and fast thinking as you make 'on the spot', life or death decisions for your band of trusting little creatures. Use the unique skills of your Lemmings team to overcome the hazards ahead: The 'Bomber' explodes at will, the 'Floater' can survive high falls and the 'Basher' digs horizontally just when you need it. The 'Climber' is at hand for those tricky mountain ranges, the 'Blocker' creates an obstacle in the path ahead and the 'Builder' is there to construct walkways for his friends. Stretch your strategies across 100 plus levels as you lead your lemmings across an immense variety of challenging backdrops. The levels are arranged into five striking themes, each with its own unique visual flavour. So, whether it's going underground into the sewers or marching through fields and forests, the lemmings always have new terrain to explore.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "May 23, 2006", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Team17 Software", "publishers": "Sony Computer Entertainment", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.72", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmings_(2006_video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nEaH4uouUo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6798-lemmings\n"}
