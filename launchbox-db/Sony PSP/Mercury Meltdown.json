{"altername_name": ["Tama-Run"], "name": "Mercury Meltdown", "overview": "Once again taking control of the liquid Mercury 'blob', players must avoid various obstacles and hazards to reach the end goal. The Mercury blob itself has now been given an overhaul and has 4 varying 'states' - Normal, Solid, Fast and Slow. These states allow for larger more complex levels, which in turn mean a greater challenge and more enjoyment to be had for the player. The number of levels has more than doubled - now 160+, and with the newly added feature of Downloadable Content more levels will be made available at a later date. Wireless 2 Player modes have also been an important addition, with 5 sub games each providing a challenge against the computer or a friend.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "October 3, 2006", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Ignition Banbury", "publishers": "Atari", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.56", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_Meltdown", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/17104-mercury-meltdown\n"}
