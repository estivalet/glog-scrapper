{"altername_name": ["WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW 2009 featuring ECW"], "name": "WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2009", "overview": "The Smackdown vs. Raw series continues with the 2009 edition. This game features improvements on the tag team action, including a new Hot-Tag mode, tag team finishers, and new actions to help in the match. As with the previous game, the roster includes over 60 superstars from Smackdown, Raw and ECW. To keep the roster up-to-date, the game includes a roster editor allowing players to change the superstars on it, as well as change their appearance from face to heel. However, this is also the first game in the Smackdown series since Here Comes the Pain not to feature any legends. Another new feature is Create-a-Finisher, which allows players to create their own unique finishing move out of over 500 different animations. These can also be shared online during online matches. The game includes two different story modes: Road to Wrestlemania and Career mode. Road to Wrestlemania mode allows the player to experience six unique stories involving the wrestlers Triple H, CM Punk, Chris Jericho, The Undertaker, John Cena, and a co-op storyline featuring Batista and Rey Mysterio. Career mode is the replacement of GM Mode from previous games. This mode allows the player to make a career for superstars and upgrade custom wrestlers. Other features include the Highlight Reel, which lets the player create videos from his matches, new Inferno and Gauntlet matches, as well as new positions in the backstage brawl.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "November 9, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Yuke's", "publishers": "THQ", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.91", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/32299-wwe-smackdown-vs-raw-2009\n"}
