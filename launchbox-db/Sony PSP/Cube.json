{"altername_name": ["The IQ Cube", "Cube: 3D Puzzle Mayhem"], "name": "Cube", "overview": "Cube is a puzzle game with action elements. The game is set in a cubic world with different stages and challenges. Players control a cube through tracks that act like 3D platforms and mazes. There are 135 levels based on nine themes in total. The different themes (called zones in the game) come with their own contraptions and a specific colour. Dangers include bombs, creatures, sinking surfaces, rotating blocks, blocks that blow the cube backwards and more. Sometimes these also need to be manipulated to create new paths (e.g. moving blocks and then luring a bomb to blow it up).", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "July 26, 2007", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Metia Interactive", "publishers": "D3Publisher", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/SqXe0Kp7vW8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73631-cube\n"}
