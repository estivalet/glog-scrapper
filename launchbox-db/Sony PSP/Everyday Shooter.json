{"altername_name": ["Riff: Everyday Shooter"], "name": "Everyday Shooter", "overview": "Everyday Shooter is an abstract shooter by Jonathan Mak released through the PlayStation network. Although seemingly a top-down arcade shooter, the title is described as an album of games, where music, gameplay and visuals are interwoven, inspired by the Rez concept. The player controls a pixel-shaped character through a series of 8 fixed-screen stages, using one stick to move and another one to shoot. The overall goal is to clear the stage of all enemies, but the mechanics to achieve this vary in each level. The same applies for combos and chain reactions. Sometimes enemies cannot be defeated directly, but require a sequence of colors or a special object that triggers the entire field. There is only a single gun with no upgrades or changes. Each stage has a different soundtrack toned to match the visuals. All sounds of destruction have been replaced by guitar notes or riffs, leading to a sea of sound that harmonizes with the overall soundtrack, causing the music to be generated procedurally. Next to the main goal there are bonus points to collect, used to unlock extras such as extra lives and new graphical effects. Completing a level opens it up in the Single Play mode, where it can be selected right away.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "December 4, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Queasy Games", "publishers": "Sony Computer Entertainment America", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGvvU5kIM84", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/15830-everyday-shooter\n"}
