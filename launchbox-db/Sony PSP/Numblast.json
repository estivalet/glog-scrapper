{"altername_name": ["Qruton"], "name": "Numblast", "overview": "NumBlast is a puzzle game that follows the story of Aoyama and Akasaka, two Japanese students who find a cubic artifact called the NumBlast. Whilst running experiments on the artifact, Aoyama accidentally causes the artifact to give off a magical explosion, which turns Akasaka into a monkey. They now have to turn Akasaka back into a human by solving the NumBlast puzzles. Gameplay revolves around using a playing board filled with numbers and changing the positions of the numbers to make a group of four numbers in a 2x2 square, resulting in the numbers exploding, the ultimate goal being to clear the board of numbers. There are 3 modes of play you can choose: Endless (detonating numbers until the board is clear), Time Trial Mode (gives you 3 minutes to get the highest possible score) and Puzzle Mode (which challenges you to complete the board within a limited number of rotations).", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "July 2, 2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "SCE Japan Studio", "publishers": "Sony Computer Entertainment", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/123542-numblast\n"}
