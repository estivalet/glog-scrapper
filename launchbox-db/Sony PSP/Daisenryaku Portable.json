{"altername_name": [], "name": "Daisenryaku Portable", "overview": "The game takes place on a battlefield of hexagons. The player must assemble an army of up to 50 units with limited funds available, and should capture cities and factories to increase its coffers. A mission can be won if the player captures the enemy capital, wipes out all enemy units, or eliminates all enemy forces and destroys or captures their factory. The units are real-life versions of existing military hardware from several nations. Through combat experience, the player can unlock two more versions of a certain unit (such as the American AH-64 Apache being upgraded to Longbow Block II and Longbow Block III configurations). Other units can also be unlocked by completing a series of individual missions, which can then be used in the campaign and skirmish modes. The factions in the game are fictional versions of Japan, the United States, Russia, China, Iraq, and Britain, with Germany as a secret faction. Portable 2's campaign takes place in the Middle East. Like in the first game, the player is a commander in the Wild Geese mercenary force aiding either one of two factions. There are 28 stages in all, but the player may not be able to access all of them in one play-through. Certain conditions such as failing to take the enemy capital by the end of the last turn, can unlock the other stages.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "December 22, 2005", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Genki", "publishers": "Genki", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daisenryaku#Daisenryaku_Portable", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/84058-daisenryaku-portable\n"}
