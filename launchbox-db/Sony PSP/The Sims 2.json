{"altername_name": ["The Sims 2: Dr. Dominic no Inbou", "Los Sims 2", "Die Sims 2"], "name": "The Sims 2", "overview": "You were riding a dusty road leading to Strangetown when suddenly a flash is blinding you. Your car hits something sharp, your wheel is popping out and you see smoke coming from the motor. You don't have a choice but to let your vehicle into the hands of Oscar, a mechanic from Strangetown. Now that you're stranded in the town, it's up to you to visit it, chat with its inhabitants and dive into a world of supernatural. The PSP version of the game is an adventure with some typical Sims 2 gameplay. You can also customize your character like in the PC version. You'll have to satisfy your character's life aspirations and personality traits by completing a series of tasks, without forgetting the daily ones (eating, showering, etc.). Also, you have a Sanity Checker: it's up to you to maintain it high if you don't want to see your character going crazy. Also, there are some minigames like for befriending another Sim or like whacking zombies' heads in a sort of whack-a-mole game.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "December 7, 2005", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Amaze Entertainment", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Life Simulation", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.55", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sims_2#PlayStation_Portable_version", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3ycYMlwMSY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/30579-the-sims-2\n"}
