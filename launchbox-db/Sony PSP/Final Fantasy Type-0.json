{"altername_name": ["Final Fantasy Reishiki", "Final Fantasy Agito XIII"], "name": "Final Fantasy Type-0", "overview": "Final Fantasy: Type-0 is an RPG in the Final Fantasy series. It is part of the Fabula Nova Crystallis project and, although not having much to do with Final Fantasy XIII, shares its mythology. The game is a RPG in which the characters travel to get missions and attack enemy strongholds to complete them. In each mission, three characters out of 14 are selected, each having their own style, weapons and abilities. The battle system is an Active System Battle (ATB) that allows the control of many characters, Characters who were KO'd in battle must be revived in town before being used again. Each character have a unique summon that can be used for 5 minutes in battle and can be levelled-up. The ATB kai, as it is called, allows for up to three players to connect via ad-hoc and send each other emergency back-up. Final Fantasy: Type-0 is set in the world of Orience, divided in four kingdoms: the Suzaku Fiefdom of Rubrum, the Milites Empire, the Lorican Alliance, and the Kingdom of Concordia, each having its own emblem based on four Japanese mythological beasts: the phoenix Suzaku, the Turtle Genbu, the tiger Byakko and the dragon Seiryuu. Every kingdom is in possession of a crystal that an mark humans as their servants, called l'Cie. Character growth is based on the Alto Crystarium system, using energy called phantoma to increase the character's abilities. The later released PC, PS4 and Xbox One versions are called Final Fantasy: Type-0 HD. They are available worldwide instead of the Japan-only PSP version. The content is almost completely identical, with a focus on localization and improvised visuals. It does not have the multiplayer functionality of the PSP version, but adds additional difficulty levels.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "October 27, 2011", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Square Enix", "publishers": "Square Enix", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "3", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.83", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_Type-0", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqdad0Ugpnw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/20371-final-fantasy-type-0\n"}
