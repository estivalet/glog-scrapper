During the turbulent times brought on by the cunning and wicked Sousou, the \"Maozoku (cat race)\" were removed from their hidden village. They're a race with with the body of a human and ears of a beast, said to be descendants of the cat-shaped youkai known as the \"Kinme (golden eyes)\". For this reason, the Maozoku are despised by humans. Humans are told of an old legend in which cats are an outcast of the 12 signs of the zodiac.
