{"altername_name": ["Strikers 1945 Plus"], "name": "Strikers 1945 Plus Portable", "overview": "Strikers 1945 Plus is a port of the classic Neo-Geo arcade game. Unlike other games in the series, this is the first time the game is officially available outside of arcades. This game is a remixed version of sorts which includes elements from the two previous games in the series, Strikers 1945 and Strikers 1945 II. There are six different planes to choose from (plus one secret one), each with their own attacks and special moves. Player weapons are weak to begin with, but firepower is improved (and secondary missiles gained!) by capturing Power-Ups. Super bombs can also be picked up, which destroy or damage any enemy or boss that is near the explosion. There are also special moves which are obtained by charging up a gauge on the side of the screen. The more damage inflicted upon the enemy, the faster it fills up. Once the gauge is completely full, hold down the attack button for an instant to unleash the special attack. Several special shots can be held in reserve and used when necessary. A new addition to the PSP version is an Endless Mode, which allows game replay with an enhanced difficulty immediately after the final boss is defeated.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "July 30, 2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Arc System Works", "publishers": "PM Studios", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.39", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LtW6zAmV7w", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/31126-strikers-1945-plus-portable\n"}
