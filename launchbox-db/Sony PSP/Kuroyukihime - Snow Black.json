She was once a commoner, but due to her beauty, the king wanted her to become his foster daughter, but with a condition- as long as she agreed to be wedded in the future for political reasons. She accepted. Her peaceful life came to an end after the prime minister Reviens Tendre rebelled. His capabilities as a prime minister were so excellent that other countries were once trying to recruit him. However, he became overwhelmed by the protagonist Snow White's beauty, and escaped in women's clothing for reasons unknown.

The protagonist had become the sole remaining member of the royal family. From then on, her life in confinement began. One day, three years later, the protagonist had finally managed to escape and ventured into a deep forest. There, she met a group individuals who hold a grudge against the \"queen\", known as \"The Alliance of Seven\". Even though he had treated the protagonist heartlessly thus far, in truth, the \"queen\" apparently is in love with her. Since the protagonist escaped his clutches, he has become half-crazed.
