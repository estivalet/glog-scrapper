{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hello Kitty: Puzzle Party", "overview": "Hello Kitty: Puzzle Party is a collection of puzzle games featuring Sanrio's ubiquitous Hello Kitty character. There are three games included: Jigsaw Puzzle is, as the name suggests, a standard jigsaw puzzle mode. The pieces come oriented properly, so the player only needs to place them in the correct spot. There are two difficulty levels: easy puzzles have 24 pieces, while hard puzzles have 48 pieces. Picture Perfect is a nonogram puzzle much like Picross. Using the numbers at the top and left as hints, the player must mark the proper squares to create a picture. There are three difficulty levels; the higher the level, the larger the puzzle. Tasty Tidbits is a falling-block puzzle very similar to Puyo Puyo. Kitty heads and fruits drop in pairs from the top of the screen and must be arranged. Connect four pieces of the same color, including at least one fruit, and they will be cleared. Easy mode starts the player at level 1, while hard mode starts the player at level 11. All of the mini-games unlock pictures and parts for the Hello Kitty Gadget, a clock & calendar featuring dozens of Hello Kitty illustrations. The design mode lets the player choose from any of the parts unlocked from the mini-games.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "May 28, 2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Dorasu", "publishers": "Dorasu", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/91206-hello-kitty-puzzle-party\n"}
