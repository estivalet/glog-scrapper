{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dungeon Explorer II", "overview": "Dungeon Explorer II is a continuation of the story told in Dungeon Explorer. As the game supports five players, the hero who enters the throne room of Ardeen is one or more of the five to-be Immortals, with a character class of the players' choice: Fighter, Thief, Wizard, Cleric, Bard, Hunter, Dwarf or the Elf. Dungeon Explorer II plays very similarly to its predecessor. Characters move around and talk to people in a regular RPG fashion. Since the movement is not limited to squares and it is possible to move diagonally, the game has very action-oriented gameplay. Combat is similar to that of The Legend of Zelda or Gauntlet, from a top-town view. Enemies spawn from generators and drop usable items, power-ups and provide experience as player-controlled characters kill them. Items are used in real-time and leveling up gives the characters more health.", "platform": "Sony PSP", "release_date": "September 15, 2010", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Hudson Soft", "publishers": "Konami", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/139683-dungeon-explorer-ii\n"}
