{"name": "Fight for Life", "overview": "Life in the afterlife can be a nightmare for anybody -- especially if real life was a mess. In the Spectre Zone, eight people compete in the annual Hell Fighting Tournament for the amusement of the Gatekeeper. The prize is a second chance at life! Defeat each opponent and steal two of their special fighting moves to prepare for the final challenge -- a battle against the son of the devil himself. Show no mercy. There will be only one victor, only one new life... it must be yours!", "platform": "Atari Jaguar", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Atari", "publishers": "Atari", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1u0yLYO52Y", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/3751"}
