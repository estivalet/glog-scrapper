On the ZX Spectrum it sold more than 117,000 copies and across all 8-bit formats more than 330,000 copies, making it Mastertronic's second best-selling original game after BMX Racers. Magic Knight has been sent to the Castle of Spriteland by the King of Ibsisima in order to find a special present for Princess Germintrude. If Magic Knight is successful in his quest, he may have proved himself worthy of joining the famous \"Polygon Table\", a reference to the mythical Round Table from the legends of King Arthur. This was the only game from the Magic Knight Series that was released under the standard Mastertronic label. The rest were released on the slightly more expensive Mastertronic Added Dimension label", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "David Jones", "publishers": "Mastertronic Ltd.", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.27", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finders_Keepers_(1985_video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZEWDG-OTPE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/53437-finders-keepers\n"}
