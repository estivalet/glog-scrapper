{"altername_name": ["Panama Joe"], "name": "Panama Joe", "overview": "As the rap-style manual explains, this traditional platform game sees Panama Joe attempting to collect treasure from Montezuma's Palace, by progressing through a maze of platform screens. The levels contain various hazards and enemies travelling on fixed patterns, who must be dodged by jumping them. Progression through the screens isn't always linear as one room often requires a key which is located a couple of rooms away. The screens have ladders to climb/descend, ropes to grab and descend, gaps to jump, on/off platforms to navigate via timing, keys to collect, doors to unlock and rolling log platforms to run across quickly. Items such as torches, gems and swords can also be collected. The game has 3 difficulty levels. Panama Joe is based on Montezuma's Revenge with identical room layouts. However, the rooms are arranged differently and a few were removed.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Amazon Systems", "publishers": "Parker Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/112901-panama-joe\n"}
