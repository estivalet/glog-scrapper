{"altername_name": [], "name": "750cc Grand Prix", "overview": "The action in this motorcycle racing game takes place in a small box of the screen, but there\u2019s a good reason for this \u2013 unlike virtually every other 8-bit motorcycle racing game, the screen tilts as you lean the bike into the corner, giving it a much more realistic feel. Six British racetracks are featured, with 3-lap races. You must finish in the top 3 of the 8-bike field to qualify for the next one. You will often need to pit for fuel and tires during the race. The other bikes get quite a head start on you by being able to accelerate more quickly, but the first few are usually quite easy to pass on the first lap.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "W.A.S.P.", "publishers": "Codemasters", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.03", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/750cc_Grand_Prix", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r308uakkAVs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/93145-750cc-grand-prix\n"}
