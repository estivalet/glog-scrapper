{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gremlins", "overview": "Uranium has become the main fuel for Earth. Unfortunately Earths supply of Uranium is dwindling fast. Jupiter has unlimited deposits of the precious metal, only one problem faces the Intergalactic miner robots from earth: GREMLINS. GREMLINS are the natural habitants of Jupiter and they eat Uranium. These creatures are very fast and vicious, with an anjazing ability to change shape. The GREMLINS want to keep their metamorphosis secret and to keep it secret, they create a wall of multicoloured light which hides the GREMLINS until they have changed. This effect only lasts a short time as it drains the GREMLINS energy. This seems not to matter too much, as there are not too many Earthlings who can survive even the first vicious onslaught.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Chris Kerry", "publishers": "Thor Computer Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/166813-gremlins\n"}
