{"altername_name": [], "name": "Eddie Kidd Jump Challenge", "overview": "Licensed around stunt legend Eddie Kidd, this game gives you the chance to recreate his death-defying feats. You start off attempting to jump oil barrels on a bicycle, with the bigger feats of jumping a motorbike over cars come later. You get no speedometer to help you judge speeds, but you can learn to gauge exactly how the bike handles and what it can do. You can position the start of your run-up, with wind needing to be factored in as an affect on the distance. Wheelies can be practices on the approach ramp. The further on you land, the better the score.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Martech Games", "publishers": "Martech Games", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC4gFy6fHmM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/29696-eddie-kidd-jump-challenge\n"}
