The player controls a ship which can fire and move left or right. The player must continuously monitor the onscreen temperature and fuel gauges; if the ship overheats, its weapon is disabled, and if it is depleted of fuel, the vessel itself explodes. The player must battle through waves of enemies, which attack with varied formations and flight patterns to reach the mothership!", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "2019", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Matt Jackson", "publishers": "Matt Jackson", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/144294-astroblaster\n"}
