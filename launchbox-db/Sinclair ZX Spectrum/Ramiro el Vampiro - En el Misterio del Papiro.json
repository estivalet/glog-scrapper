{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ramiro el Vampiro: En el Misterio del Papiro", "overview": "Ramiro is spending some time with his dearest friend, Ram\u00f3n the Pharaoh, in the ancient palace of Abu Cimbrel (province of Badajoz), drinking their asses off. Ramon tells him about the old mystery of a papyrus hidden in the Pyramid of Example (who was the god of demonstrations, invoked by anybody who exclaims \"for example!\") which was broken in four pieces and hiden in four mortuary chambers. The papyrus is said to have been written by Aton himself, who was the Sun God, and is known for containing one of his dearest secrets. Drunk as he was, Ramiro thinks it's a great idea to gather the pieces of the papyrus because, by knowing Aton's dearest secrets, he could very well control the Sun and create a \"portable night\" of sorts around him to become the most fearsome vampire in the County (province of Badajoz). Without losing a minute, Ramiro sets off to the Pyramid. Collect the 4 pieces of papyrus and give them to Ramon. To do this, look for coins and give them to the altar to exchange them for items that you can give to the various characters you find in Abu Cimbrel's old palace. Watch out for the Eye, if it sees you, it will take your life.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "2023", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "The Mojon Twins", "publishers": "The Mojon Twins", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/168544-ramiro-el-vampiro-en-el-misterio-del-papiro\n"}
