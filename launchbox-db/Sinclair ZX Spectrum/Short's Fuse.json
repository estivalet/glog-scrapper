{"altername_name": ["Bombscare"], "name": "Short's Fuse", "overview": "Special agent Sam Short is tasked with going around the world defusing bomb detonators planted by his archenemy Boris. Bombscare is a pretty straightforward fixed-screen platform fare. Sam jumps around platforms chasing the detonators with 9 seconds to collect each and every one. Once a detonator is defused, the timer resets to 9 seconds. If the timer reaches 0, a life is lost. When all detonators have been defused, the level is cleared and play proceeds to the next one.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dollarsoft", "publishers": "Dollarsoft", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/102883-shorts-fuse\n"}
