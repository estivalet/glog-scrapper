{"altername_name": [], "name": "Skatin' USA", "overview": "After his adventures in Superkid, Tom Essex has woke up with his superpowers gone but he still has the determination to clean up the streets of New York. With his trusty skateboard and catapult, Tom will skate around the streets over six levels of this flick-screen platform game, removing all the thugs so the streets are safe once more. Tom can shoot the thugs with his catapult but has limited ammo and if a thug is touched then Tom will lose energy and when it is zero then it is game over. Food can be collected to keep his energy topped up as well as bonus points scattered around. To complete a level, dollar bills need collecting so you can exit by the far right of the level. When one is collected the letters of SKATIN' USA light up and all letters need lighting up before a bonus counter reaches zero. Once a level is completed it is onto a bonus screen where Tom has to get as many bonus points before the timer reaches zero. The joystick is used to control Tom.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/104581-skatin-usa\n"}
