{"altername_name": [], "name": "XOR", "overview": "Xor is an enhanced version of a puzzle game in which the player controls two avatars wandering through one of fifteen different labyrinthine levels in any order, trying to collect all the comedic masks and return to the level exit without running out of moves. Developed and released seventeen years after the game's initial release, this Windows conversion naturally features a few aesthetic amenities lacking in the original: graphics and sound are greatly enhanced, including an optional alternate tileset, while the player's view of the surrounding map area is slightly expanded. The game also supports user-made levels, and the porters have provided a level editor for this purpose.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Logotron", "publishers": "Logotron", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78852-xor\n"}
