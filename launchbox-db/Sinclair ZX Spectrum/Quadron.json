But this was the sole survivor for a reason; decades spent repelling the marauding,crystal-stealing aliens had hardened and transformed the droid into the ultimate fighting machine. By gaining power-ups from rapid alien kills, to wielding high-tech objects scattered throughout the base, this innovative droid had learnt to overcome the impossible and keep the alien menace at bay! Use skill and strategy to control the last remaining D-Droid; guard the Quadron base from relentless alien attack, and gain the best score and highest wave possible!
