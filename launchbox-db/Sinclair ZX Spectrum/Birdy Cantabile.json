{"altername_name": [], "name": "Birdy Cantabile", "overview": "Birdy is a little sparrow who wants to become a music conductor. Today is his first concert! After a lot of rehearsal, all the little birds gathered in the Main Hall to watch Birdy's performance. But what is this...!? Due to the flapping wings of all the little birds the score has flown away! Each page of the score is somewhere in the eight rehearsal halls. Birdy needs to recover the eight pages and put them in the music stand in the correct order, but how can we know which page is the good one? Fortunately, some little birds are helping Birdy. On each hall there is a little music stand, there you can listen to the page of the score that is lost in that room. The birds will tell you if it is the page you need to take! Be careful to take the pages of the score in the correct order. If not, when you finally play the score, the music will not make the little birds so happy. Some musical notes left the score and went crazy, they are walking uncontrolled through the halls: do not touch them. And somebody has left anti-roosting spike strips here and there! What a shame! Be careful, we are sure you will prevail with the kind support of the little birds.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "2019", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "iadvd", "publishers": "iadvd", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/144470-birdy-cantabile\n"}
