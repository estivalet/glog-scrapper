{"altername_name": [], "name": "Vade Retro", "overview": "In your mission you will have to recover the parts of your sword to be able to use it. You're going to need it in order to kill Delcram. It will also be highly recommended to find the potion that the sorceress Aganzia gave you on her day, with which you will bewitch your sword. Without it there will be no use trying to finish the adventure. The order of collection of the objects is irrelevant although a series of messages will appear when you can use the sword or when you can finish with Delcram.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "2015", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "retroworks", "publishers": "Retroworks", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151771-vade-retro\n"}
