{"altername_name": [], "name": "Astroball", "overview": "The player controls a bouncing ball and collects coins from each level before proceeding to a level's exit. Small spikes, named Deathstars, are to be avoided, as any collision results in a life being lost. The game also features \"blinking\" platforms, which can only be used for bouncing when visible, requiring careful timing from the player. Various power-ups can be collected, including extra time, temporary invulnerability, and a slow motion mode. The main power-up item will cycle between the various power-ups available, and its sprite updates accordingly. Most levels require the player to determine the appropriate power-ups to be collected to progress through the level.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Balor Knight", "publishers": "Revelation Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.81", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroball", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A4PSGDSOxE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133514-astroball\n"}
