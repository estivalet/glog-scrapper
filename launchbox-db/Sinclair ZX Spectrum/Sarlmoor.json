{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sarlmoor", "overview": "It has been blue once, this sun. As blue as ice, and as hot as Satan's Heart. Now it's glow had gone, and the freezing wastes of its satellites were only the dead relics of another age. Who knows what civilisations had flourished under it's rays, what they had strived for, what they had achieved. The legends say that the people who live under a blue sun tend towards the ways of thought and calmness, whilst those under a red sun turn to warfare and destruction. The ship's computer interrupted Salmoor's thoughts, \"Orbital procedures now completed, mission commencing.\" Underneath this dead sun, beyond the surface lizards, beyond the tunnel of death, lay the biologic power generators of the evil Vard. The Vard, in all their hideous guises, had harnessed a colony of infant Zorr, and subjected them to the terror of biologic power, long since outlawed in the civilised zones. It was a slow process of waste and decay, where living beings ware kept on the brink of death in order to provide electricity for a parasitic few. This time it was the Zorr who were trapped; a peaceful race who metamorphose from gyrating worm-like creatures into beautiful winged giants. Sarlmoor's task was to free the Zorr by giving them the valuable energy pulses which would speed their change, and allow their flight to freedom. Only then would he allow himself to return to his spacecraft and fire the teleport button transporting him to safety. Only then could he relax. Only then depart from this cold desolation.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Colin Jones", "publishers": "Atlantis Software Ltd.", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3exNKWqRqMo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/122857-sarlmoor\n"}
