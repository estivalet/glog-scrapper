{"altername_name": ["Jet Set Willy: Maria vs Some Bastards"], "name": "Maria vs. Some Bastards", "overview": "Someone's kidnapped Willy and his housekeeper Maria has to pay the kidnappers the amount of items the 256 items they are demanding. One of the more 'out-there' JSW mods available (which is saying something...) the game is littered with bad language - somewhat given away by the needlessly aggressive title! If you're easily offended, you might want to give this one a miss. The game itself has some unusual features for a Jet Set Willy game. Obviously you play as Maria rather than Willy himself and she is too tough to die from falling from heights - this dramatically changes the gameplay and how you approach situations. Also, some of the bad guys can be touched while others can't. There's a load of secrets throughout the rooms and the game does not play like your usual Jet Set Willy hack.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "2003", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Manic Miner Technologies", "publishers": "", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5dgHsNHC7Q", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165212-maria-vs-some-bastards\n"}
