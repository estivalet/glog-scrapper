{"altername_name": [], "name": "Psycho City", "overview": "The streets of our fair city are no longer safe. The year is 1991, drug crazed gunmen, muggers and junkies prowl the streets in a city whare it's not even safe for the Dealers, Pushers and Hookers to make a dishonest living. You work these streets as one of New Yorks finest. In the past six months you have seen the situation degenerate, almost all your fellow cops are on the Mafias payroll, your family and partner have all been wiped out by hired hit-men drafted in from Chicago by the infamous Mr. Big. You know that you cannot rest until you have wiped the streets clean of the organised crime syndicate that controls the city. You have three main objectives. Firstly, shoot anything that moves, unless it looks like you, these are extra men. You must also collect bags of money and stolen goods, these should be dropped into the bank vault to claim a reward (the bank vault is situated on your start screen). Your main objective is to find Mr. Bigs hideout and blow him away.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Players Software", "publishers": "Players Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/143578-psycho-city\n"}
