{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dandy", "overview": "Hack, thrash and pillage your way to oblivion in 15 dungeons that descend into the heat and darkness of men's souls. Sheba, raw onions and knackwurst, 240lbs of screaming blood lust. Thor, one Norwegian mother you don't mess with. Alone or together the challenge remains the same: grab the treasure and trash the droves of nasties that are bent hell-ways to trash you. Keep your energy up with any snacks you find and you may even come out alive. If you do and all the treasure has been collected you will be presented with a clue at the end of each set of dungeons. Collect the clues from all three dungeon loads and solve the riddle.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "The RamJam Corporation", "publishers": "Electric Dreams Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/54502-dandy\n"}
