The aliens are trapped in soil pockets and are let out by dozer's activities. Aliens are disposed of either by dropping rocks on them or catching them in the blast of your limited supply of bombs. Bombs are also to be found in the soil that can be pushed on unsuspecting enemies.The bombs themselves will not harm you, but the blast of one will kill you as well as any adjacent enemies.The supply can be replenished by picking up craters filled with bombs.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Probe Software", "publishers": "Firebird Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uzf4gtaiOcs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/103131-down-to-earth\n"}
