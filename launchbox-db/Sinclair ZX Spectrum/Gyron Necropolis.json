{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gyron Necropolis", "overview": "Inside the Gyron are two intricate Labyrinths, one within the other; each contains all of Space and Time. The outer Labyrinth, the Atrium, and the inner, called the Necropolis, are cosmic calendar clocks. Space is contained in the 12 parts of the Zodiac, represented by 12 zones, while Time exists in the configuration of an interactive defence system - the Celestial Spheres and the Towers of Silence. Seekers may choose to enter the Atrium first, a less dangerous place in which to test the reflexes - it's entered through the Calendarstone, the face of the Sundisc. Another Sundisc (the Atrium's 12th zone) inside the Atrium Labyrinth is the entrance to the Necropolis. The solutions to finding the inner entrance and the PLACE OF WISDOM depend on the layout of the Labyrinths, the configuration of the Towers and the Spheres' time-cycles. The CELESTIAL SPHERES roll in predetermined motions around the Labyrinths: in the Necropolis Labyrinth the combined cycles of the 55 spheres there repeat once in every 15 billion years - the lifespan of the Universe. Contact with the Spheres is fatal. The TOWERS OF SILENCE radiate a destructive energy field in one of the four alignments of the Labyrinth. They can be attacked by laser from behind: but they interact with each other. An attack on a Tower may cause it to turn, vanish, reappear elsewhere, or to re-orientate another Tower. A blind spot to an energy field exists against the trench wall below the Tower.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Firebird Software", "publishers": "Firebird Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147326-gyron-necropolis\n"}
