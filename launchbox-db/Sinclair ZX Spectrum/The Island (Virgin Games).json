{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Island (Virgin Games)", "overview": "The Island is a mix of a traditional text adventure where each location is described by text and you use the keyboard to type in commands to interact with each location and an action game where you have to use your reflexes to avoid dangerous obstacles. The objective is to use a treasure map to find the treasure which is hidden on a different island from your starting location. You have to find the correct island, then locate the buried treasure and bring it back home. If you fail at one of the action sequences you have failed in your quest and it is game over.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Martyn Charles Davis", "publishers": "Virgin Games", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/117776-the-island-virgin-games\n"}
