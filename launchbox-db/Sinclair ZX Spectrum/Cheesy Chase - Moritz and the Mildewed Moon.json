{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cheesy Chase: Moritz and the Mildewed Moon", "overview": "A celebration cut short after leaving the moon a tad too fast in his last quest, then being caught by the moon patrol cops who claimed he broke the sound barrier, twice! The shockwaves and noise caused major ripples across the moon, much to the annoyance of its inhabitants. As punishment, Moritz ended up with three points on his space driving licence and sentenced to do community work, which entails collecting all the mildewed chees from the surface of the moon. It's a stinky job and a lesson learnt but will Moritz cope to the very end or has he to go to jail?", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "December 23, 2019", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Andy Green", "publishers": "Stonechat Productions", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_nSuWIR32E", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/163739-cheesy-chase-moritz-and-the-mildewed-moon\n"}
