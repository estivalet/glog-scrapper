When he is not gloating over the gold he grows toadstools of a most delicious nature. You find yourself in the dwarf's garden and the aim is for you to collect the gold but to stay alive you have to eat. In between you have to dodge the gardener and his wheelbarrow and spade. The garden is full of magic hedges which move from side to side and up and down - this is commonly known as \"The Flux\".", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Krypton Force", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/BgB9ZPs3o4k", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148067-flux\n"}
