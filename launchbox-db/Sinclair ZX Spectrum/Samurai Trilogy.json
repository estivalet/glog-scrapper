{"altername_name": [], "name": "Samurai Trilogy", "overview": "The name Samurai Trilogy refers to the fact that players can choose between three fighting styles: karate, kendo and samurai. In every of those disciplines the player gets confronted with six opponents, all with a different background and strengths. Before every fight the player chooses three training styles - examples being meditation, strength training or breath control - and the fight tactic emphasis (points divided to skill, speed, stamina and strength) for both attack and defense. The fights itself offer no surprises: the player performs different moves and attacks (overall 16) and tries to outsmart his opponent. Everyone has a attack and defense bar and if one of the two runs out, the fight is over. Additionally there is a training mode available.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Five Ways Software", "publishers": "Gremlin Graphics Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "0.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/93609-samurai-trilogy\n"}
