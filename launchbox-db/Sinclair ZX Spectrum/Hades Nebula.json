{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hades Nebula", "overview": "Hades Nebula is a 1987 Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum and Atari ST game by Nexus Information Systems. It is a vertical-scrolling space shooter. The player controls an upgradable fighter that must battle its way through thousands of enemy ships before it confronts the last boss, Emperor Hades. There are fifteen levels in this game. Enemies are face-like ships or bug-like ships that materialise at certain points in the game. Upon appearance they immediately seek out the player's ship and collide with it unless evasive action is taken. Also, every one or two levels or so, 'mother ship' bosses are encountered that take a considerable amount of bullet dodging and incisive shots to destroy. There are two sound options while playing the game; either sound effects or the musical soundtrack by Ben Daglish. The latter is the default mode, and changes depending on whether you are fighting a boss or charging through a level.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.07", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/93403-hades-nebula\n"}
