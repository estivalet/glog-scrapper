{"altername_name": ["Seiddab Attack"], "name": "3D Seiddab Attack", "overview": "The Seiddab (look at it twice and you'll get the joke) are on the rampage on the planet, and you have been sent out to stop them in your trusty tank. With a full 3D view, you must first take them on in the cities, shooting 10 down to face the leading man. A scanner is provided to give you a view of which streets the Seiddab lurk on, allowing you to steer left and right to reach them, as well as adjusting your sights to take them down. Once cleared, you move onto an open-plan countryside area, with more units coming towards you, and they now drop bombs towards you, putting your 3 lives at a greater premium.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Steve Turner", "publishers": "Hewson Consultants", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.29", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-782LD01Im8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78187-3d-seiddab-attack\n"}
