{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hacker II: The Doomsday Papers", "overview": "Hacker II: The Doomsday Papers is a real-time strategy game. It is the sequel to Hacker Once again you hack into a computer system, just to end up saving the world. Hacker II: The Doomsday Papers opens with the console to the \"Actisource\" computer hotline system (a nice self-ironic pun - although nobody knows why a serious hacker might want to crack a help service for computer games...). However, your quiet little hack is soon disturbed: The government wants you for a secret mission. It, again, involves a robot drone and you're the one at the remote control. Although this time, it's not the whole globe that's your playground, but a high security facility in Russia, where the plans for global domination are hidden.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Activision", "publishers": "Activision", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/16885-hacker-ii-the-doomsday-papers\n"}
