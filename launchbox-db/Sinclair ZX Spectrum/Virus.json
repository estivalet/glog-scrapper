{"altername_name": [], "name": "Virus", "overview": "Aliens have infested Earth, and are spreading a deadly virus throughout the planet. Needless to say, they must be stopped, and fast. The time pressure (your score upon completing a level is based on the uninfected percentage of the land) is only one difficult aspect of this shooter. Viewed in remote 3D with a patchwork-quilt type ground effect, with trees sticking out and full gravity.
