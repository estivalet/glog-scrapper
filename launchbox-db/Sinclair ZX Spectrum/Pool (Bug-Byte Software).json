{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pool (Bug-Byte Software)", "overview": "This is a very simple pool simulation for one or two players. The playing screen consists of a red cue ball and 6 numbered red balls on a green background. In the top left of the screen is a blue power bar that cycles through 1 to 5 levels. The player uses the arrow keys to position a cursor, then presses S to shoot. If you don't pot anything after about half a dozen shots, then the game resets. There's no clever physics behind this game, balls don't seem to slow down as they move across the table, they move at a steady pace until they stop. The points scored for each ball potted are calculated as 10 * the ball's number", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Bug-Byte Software", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/81384-pool-bug-byte-software\n"}
