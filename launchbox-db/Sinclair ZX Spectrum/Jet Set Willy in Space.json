{"altername_name": [], "name": "Jet Set Willy in Space", "overview": "Willy always was a glutton for punishment. What's more, he never seemed to be very good at learning from his mistakes. You'd think that he'd be wary of Martians and the like by now, after some of them added all those strange rooms to his mansion. But no; joining the upper echelons of society rather went to Willy's head, and a rich twit has a greater capacity for making big mistakes than a penniless one. When a passing Used TARDIS Salesman came by, Willy was gullible enough to be taken in. Needless to say, the old TARDIS that Willy bought was decidedly dodgy, and broke down upon arrival at a space station orbiting the planet Endor. So here he is, stranded in space and far from home. Willy can't even get back into his TARDIS to try to mend it, because it's permanently locked into its dematerialisation phase with him on the outside! But all is not lost: before Willy landed, his initial scans of the area indicated the presence of a powerful intergalactic matter transporter somewhere on the planet's surface. All Willy has to do is to find enough power packs to get it working. Once it's fully powered up, he'll be able to enter the rocket on the planet's surface, operate its computers, and set the transporter's destination coordinates so that it will send him back home. Jet Set Willy in Space is highly influenced by Jet Set Willy II: The Final Frontier and is itself the follow-up to Join the Jet Set.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1997", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Halsoft", "publishers": "", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOD83xdZ6B0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165220-jet-set-willy-in-space\n"}
