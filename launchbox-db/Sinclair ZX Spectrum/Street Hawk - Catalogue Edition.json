Also given away free to some subscribers of Crash magazine. The game itself is a simplistic shooter that appears to bear very little to do with the TV show it's based on.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ocean Software", "publishers": "Ocean Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BLFr5BNFXw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165156-street-hawk-catalogue-edition\n"}
