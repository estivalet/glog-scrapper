{"altername_name": [], "name": "Frank N, Stein Re-booted", "overview": "Published on 14 September 2011, precisely 27 years after the original Frank N Stein. As with the original version, the idea is to create the monster's skeleton by building it up piece by piece, in the right order. Then apply the power and bring him to life! On the even levels, you need to destroy the monster and now it's a little more Donkey Kong style and you can jump! You still need the springs though, in order to jump high enough and get to the next platform.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "September 14, 2011", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Colin Stewart", "publishers": "Colin Stewart", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VtDmrLZDKM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/146491-frank-n-stein-re-booted\n"}
