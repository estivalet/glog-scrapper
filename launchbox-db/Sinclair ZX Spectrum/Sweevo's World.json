Sweevo must find and destroy the malfunctioning Waste Ingestion and Janitor Units (\"Wijus\") that are supposed to keep Knutz Folly clean, while avoiding various hostile creatures and structures. Among the other characters inhabiting Knutz Folly are the Goose Which Laid The Golden Erg (sic), the Horrible Little Girls (\"Minxes\"), and the Goose-Stepping Dictators. \"Brownies\" may be collected for additional brownie points. Sweevo cannot jump and must rely on elevators to climb obstacles. He is not armed but can kill enemies by dropping objects on them or manoeuvring them into traps.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Greg Follis", "publishers": "Gargoyle Games", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.12", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweevo%27s_World", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLbLpWcwlaA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/77966-sweevos-world\n"}
