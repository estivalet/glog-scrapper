{"altername_name": [], "name": "Trom", "overview": "Your task is quite simple to understand but not so easy to manage. In the corners of the screen are the bits. Can you steer your bitsearcher, collect the bits one at a time, and drop them into the fearful fiery furnace? The bits will incinerate as you pass over the flames. Mine you don't incinerate yourself! The bytes which bounce across the screen must be avoided, as should the poisonous pixels fired by the nasty nibbles on patrol around the screen. Success brings more problems: more bytes, more bits and more nasty nibbles.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "B.
