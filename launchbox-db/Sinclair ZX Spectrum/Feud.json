{"altername_name": [], "name": "Feud", "overview": "You take the role of Learic and playing the game is simply a matter of moving through the kingdom collecting ingredients to make spells. You are able to mix these spells and use them against your opposing Wizard LEANORIC, but remember LEANORIC is doing the same and is out to destroy you. Wander about picking up herbs (they change colour) for spells. Return to your cauldron to mix spells, then seek out your opponent and use the spells against him.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Binary Design", "publishers": "Bulldog Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/93473-feud\n"}
