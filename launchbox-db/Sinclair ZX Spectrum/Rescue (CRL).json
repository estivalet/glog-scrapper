{"altername_name": [], "name": "Rescue (CRL)", "overview": "Rescuing the princess is a three-stage operation in this adventure game - four-stage if you count reading and absorbing the separate instructions program and making notes of the many things you could forget, as there are no paper instructions of any form. First you must reach the castle she is being held in, then search the castle and find her, then take her back to base. Six main instructions are used in the game, selected via the number keys. A map can be called up to show the pattern of the game's layout, with numbers representing particular sections. You can search these, pick up any items you find, and move into adjacent ones. A gun and a radio are the most useful items to find - there are many enemy-occupied locations which will kill you without a gun. The castle can only be reached from one of the 40 squares, and you must find which, and have the right items to cross over to it.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/115306-rescue-crl\n"}
