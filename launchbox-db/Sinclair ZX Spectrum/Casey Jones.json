{"altername_name": [], "name": "Casey Jones", "overview": "Casey Jones is a Moon Patrol variant where the buggy from the arcade game has been replaced by a steam engine. It's no ordinary old locomotive though since it can both jump and shoot missiles. Like the game it is based on it is a side scrolling game where the player's vehicle is constantly moving forward and the task is to jump past craters while shooting the enemies that drop projectiles and the rocks that block the road. When shooting, missiles are launched in two directions, one goes forward while the other goes straight upwards. Making contact with a crater, a rock or a projectile leads to a life being lost. In total the game consists of eighteen stages, each having a different kind of enemy.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Blaby Computer Games", "publishers": "Blaby Computer Games", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/105029-casey-jones\n"}
