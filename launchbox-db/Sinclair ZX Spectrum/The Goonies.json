{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Goonies", "overview": "The Goonies' goal is to find One-Eyed Willy's Pirate Ship. You must cooperate with Mikey, Brand, Mouth, Data, Stef, Andy and Chunk to find the treasure and save your families' homes from foreclosures. The members of the evil Fratelli gang will try to keep you from reaching the Pirate Ship. Stay out of their way! There are plenty of other perils as you search through the underground chambers: hissing steam, deadly bats, poisonous slime, demonic flying skulls, and a giant octopus add to the challenge. Your objective in each screen is to make the two Goonies work together to solve the puzzle and find the exit. You'll walk, run, jump, climb and bounce on trampolines. Don't fall into the water or lava pits! It's impossible to get through any screen without creatively using both characters featured in that screen. Teamwork is the key to success.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Paragon Programming", "publishers": "Erbe Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIVeSrRhNkU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/55522-the-goonies\n"}
