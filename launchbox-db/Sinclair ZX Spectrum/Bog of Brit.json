{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bog of Brit", "overview": "Bog of Brit is a fantasy themed text adventure for the Sinclair ZX Spectrum. It was developed by Ian S. Brown. It was originally published by Strombringer Software, but also released by Zenobi Software (both releases were in 1990). Story: Everybody knows that 'BARBARIANS' are renowned for being fierce, aggressive and totally ruthless beings whose only aim in life is to cause as much damage as possible in as short a time as possible. Nobody was safe from their onslaught, they would sack, pillage and burn wherever it took their fancy, often without the slightest regard for the poor unfortunates on the receiving end of their aggression. This disregard for the well-being of others, linked with their insatiable lust for savagery and killing, led to them being despised throughout the civilized world. However, now and again, one member of a race will come along who will not conform to the pattern laid down and 'BOG of BRIT was one of those! Like all good 'BARBARIANS', BOG was also despised but for all the wrong reasons was GOOD and KIND and GENEROUS and GENTLE, qualities that made the milk of any self-respecting 'BARBARIAN' turn sour and curdle on the spot. The local village children took great pleasure in taunting poor BOG and would often unleash the warhounds on him for a spot of fun, whiling away a happy hour just watching BOG running for all he was worth in order to evade being torn to shreds by the devil-dogs. And so it was on that fateful day that 'BOG of BRIT', outcast and all-around-good-guy, decided that enough was enough and that he would set out to prove that his way was best and that a kind word was more effective than a cutting blow. Just to ensure that BOG made good haste in his quest, the children untied the warhounds and with a cry of \"KILL!!!\" sent them pounding after poor BOG. He in the meantime, just lowered his head and sprinted for all he was worth.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ian S.
