{"altername_name": [], "name": "Eugene: Lord of the Bathroom", "overview": "Earth's destiny lies in the balance. Rumour has it that mad scientists are developing a new weapon so dangerous it makes the a-bomb look like a firecracker. Reliable sources confirms that it's got something to do with Miner Willy's DNA, some radioactive components and a fairly large sausage. Eugene, the most evil being in the galaxy, ain't to happy with people who go out and do evil stuff without letting him in on it, so he has decided to find out what's going on, kill those responsible and possibly destroy the entire universe. Well, that's what happens when one writes the plot after the game's all done... But then again, we all know that Manic Miner games don't have to rely on sophisticated plots. It's all about the thrill of jumping up and down... So, take Eugene (That toilet drinking, four eyed antihero from Manic Miner) and guide him through 16 levels of unspeakable 48K glory.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1999", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Manic Miner Technologies", "publishers": "", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Hy-Pm02nVE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165223-eugene-lord-of-the-bathroom\n"}
