The goal is to win three tournaments: the British, the European and the World finals. The game follows the rules of the Lawn Tennis Association. The player uses only three keys - left and right for taking a position and P for tossing and hitting the ball however, the timing of your hit can control the direction to outwit the opponent SuperBrat.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "T.J.
