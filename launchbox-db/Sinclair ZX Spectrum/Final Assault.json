{"altername_name": [], "name": "Final Assault", "overview": "Final Assault is a mountain climbing action/simulation game. The object of the game is to climb to the peak of a mountain via several different trails of varying difficulty. Progress is made in a fashion similar to that used in Epyx 'games' series, with alternating joystick movements. To help out, you carry a backpack which you may stock with assorted items. Since there is a weight limit, you must choose which items you most likely will need for a given trail. For example, an exceptionally long trail may require camping gear and some additional food, where as a short trail will allow for some more luxuries such as extra rope.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Choice Software", "publishers": "Erbe Software", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.9", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM54whn8TMA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/119462-final-assault\n"}
