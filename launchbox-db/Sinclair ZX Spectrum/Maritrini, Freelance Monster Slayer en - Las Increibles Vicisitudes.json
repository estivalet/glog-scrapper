{"altername_name": [], "name": "Maritrini, Freelance Monster Slayer en: Las Increibles Vicisitudes", "overview": "This game is a prequel to \u201cMaritrini, Freelance Monster Slayer\u201d. Maritrini McAndrews, the famous actress with a starring role in \u201cMaritrini, Monster Slayer\u201d, has a really flamboyant life, full of meetings and parties. One morning, she woke up to an amazing hangover, with her one night stand lying to her side, in her huge mansion located at the outskirts of the city. A bad \u201cabsentas night\u201d, some would say. She really has to hurry to get in time to an audition for \u201cVigorous Monsters with Shiny, Manly Chests\u201d, which she intended to be her next big success in the movies. The only solution is jumping to her car and drive away to the studios, but FIRST she must complete some\u2026 \u201cbasic morning tasks\u201d. Besides, there\u2019s a mad pig wandering around the house (George Clooney missed her pet in one of the latest huge parties!) which is a real bummer. And, besides, Maritrini and her one night stand passed out while watching \u201cThe Goonies\u201d late at night in cable TV, and the mixture of absenta, cathodic rays, and sleep privation made the Fratelli Family corporeus\u2026 and really angry. Those are really bad guys! Can you help Maritrini to complete her \u201cbasic morning tasks\u201d?", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "2012", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "The Mojon Twins", "publishers": "The Mojon Twins", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/150561-maritrini-freelance-monster-slayer-en-las-increibles-vicisitudes\n"}
