{"altername_name": [], "name": "Goku Mal", "overview": "Our good ol\u2019 Eleuterio, the Serious Monkey, was a well known inventor. He started at a very early age with simple things such as sleeping pills or explosives, but soon grew to bigger things. Feeling lonely after Cheril left to become a Goddess, Eleuterio decided it was time to put all his knowledge to good use and build himself a beautiful female friend with whom he could spend long rainy afternoons playing cards or telling jokes. He started with the basic mixture of fluids in a big jar. Then he started adding some vegetables, so his future friend came out nice and healthy. Then he added proteins, so she was strong. He threw in some protein afterwards, so she was strong, and finally he added phosphor so the girl was smart and intelligent. But something went bad. Maybe he made a mistake with the mixture \u2013 because what came out the jar wasn\u2019t precisely a beautiful woman\u2026 It was a Goku Bad! A brawny short man, with spiky hair and a funny face! Eleuterio was so angry that he took the creature and threw him to a mountain of ready-to-burn dirty socks (have you ever seen a monkey washing socks? They burn them all once they are dirty!) and flew, incredibly disgusted. But aye, Goku Bad soon awoke, and readily understood what had happened. He began to grow a sentiment of anger that soon became a thirst for blood and revenge. Beware, Eleuterio, Goku Bad is mad and is going after you!", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "2013", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mojon Twins", "publishers": "Mojon Twins", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147004-goku-mal\n"}
