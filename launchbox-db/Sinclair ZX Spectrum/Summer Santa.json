{"altername_name": [], "name": "Summer Santa", "overview": "As Summer Santa you must skilfully and quietly manoeuvre your way around the house filling stockings with presents whilst trying as hard as possible not to wake anyone in the building. However, you can only carry one present at a time, therefore after delivering one present you will have to return to the grotto and collect another one. Points are awarded for delivering presents and drinking the glasses of sherry. Beware - you will have to avoid a whole host of flying objects. Also included in this program is a preview mode to help you view some of the many rooms of the house.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "John Hopper", "publishers": "Alpha Omega Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/123499-summer-santa\n"}
