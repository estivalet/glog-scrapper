Creatures attack from every angle and rather than kill you they merely bounce you around. This make make the game sound easy, but oh no! The enemies bounce you off cliffs, off ropes and into deep chasms, dropping to your doom. The object of the game is to guide Sabreman out of the Underwurlde and back out of castle. This is easier said than done. The game features 597 screens and also large monsters blocking your way. These need to be destroyed by a particular weapon before you can continue on your journey.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "December 1, 1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ultimate Play The Game", "publishers": "Ultimate Play the Game", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.18", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underwurlde", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA-80m_qsoE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/26557-underwurlde\n"}
