{"altername_name": [], "name": "Transylvanian Castle 2: The Eye of Velnor", "overview": "Translyvanian Castle 2 takes a visual turn to become something more similar to an Eye of the Beholder. Gone are the flat screens, now we have a first-person view of the maze; Objects and enemies can be seen from a distance and we can avoid an attack if we wish. Speaking of attacks, the game not only handles attack and defense values, but also allows equipping multipliers such as weapons, shields, helmets. Items can be found by the labyrinth or left behind by downed enemies. We can carry up to nine, but the game also allows us to leave those that do not have immediate use, to come back to look for them later. Among the elements of attack and defense that we mentioned before, we can also find potions and wands with different powers.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "2021", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Fitosoft", "publishers": "Fitosoft", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/150377-transylvanian-castle-2-the-eye-of-velnor\n"}
