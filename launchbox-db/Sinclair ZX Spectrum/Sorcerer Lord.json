{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sorcerer Lord", "overview": "Sorcerer Lord is a medieval fantasy game of tactical warfare. The evil Shadowlord's army is threatening to overrun the peaceful country of Galanor. The alliance of races in Galanor isn't very fond of suppression, slavery or extinction, so they are preparing for war -- it's your job to coordinate the Galanorian defense. Movement and combat are turn-based. You and the Shadowlord alternately recruit new troops, move armies on a 2D hex-map of the land and try to conquer the enemies garrisons. The outcome of fights is shown as plain text only. Although the gameplay is quite simple, there are a few tactical knacks like certain races fighting more fiercely in certain terrain types, fatigue levels and basic statistics for army leaders. Despite the game's title, magic is a rather unimportant element of chance in battles and not under your direct control. The game contains a time limit; you've got 40 turns in easy level, less in advanced levels.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Cybercon Enterprises", "publishers": "PSS", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorcerer_Lord", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/ok_stQ8j2qI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148533-sorcerer-lord\n"}
