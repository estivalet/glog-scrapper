{"altername_name": [], "name": "Racing Manager", "overview": "It's a new racing season, and you have your eye on Derby Day, only 25 meetings away. Experience all the thrills of the racetrack. Manage a stable of ten horses, training and selecting the best runners for each race, looking carefully at the form, the going and distance. Buy and sell horses as your fortunes ebb and flow. Back your selection and then watch the race. If you can't bear the tension, you can just see the last furlong to discover if you've made the big time or are back on your uppers. A very realistic simulation of the race-horse scene, using the Spectrum, and your judgement, to the limit.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mark Alexander", "publishers": "Virgin Games", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "0.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83546-racing-manager\n"}
