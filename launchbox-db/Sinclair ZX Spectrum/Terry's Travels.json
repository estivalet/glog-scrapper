{"altername_name": [], "name": "Terry's Travels", "overview": "Terry's Travels is a variant of the arcade game Frogger. This time it's a turtle called Terry that needs to be guided across heavily trafficked roads and log-jammed rivers in an attempt to reach home. The objective of the game is simply to reach the top of the screen in each level. The first level has the same layout as the game arcade with a road and a river. The next two levels are roads only or rivers only. The roads are busier than in most variants while the rivers have oil barrels that have to be avoided. The fourth level is completely different and involves moving through a maze. There are bad guys to avoid and a number of switches that open and close gates when moved over. The player has five lives and the game ends when they are all gone.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Paul Barsby", "publishers": "Algray Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148627-terrys-travels\n"}
