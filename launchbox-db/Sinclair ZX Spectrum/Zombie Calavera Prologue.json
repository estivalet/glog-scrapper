{"altername_name": [], "name": "Zombie Calavera Prologue", "overview": "Featuring a unique style of dark silhouettes with a deep blue background and menacing themes, you must recover 16 crucifixes in the cemetery to gather spritual energy to open the door to purgatory to find your beloved. Beware however this wont be easy, as even though you are armed with a rifle, evil monsters once removed will return as winged spirits that will be much harder to avoid! Use the backgrounds, hide in the darkness, remain immobile and hopefully you'll survive long enough to complete your quest.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "2010", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "", "developers": "The Mojon Twins", "publishers": "The Mojon Twins", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/149733-zombie-calavera-prologue\n"}
