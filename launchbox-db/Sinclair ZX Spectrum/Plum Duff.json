{"altername_name": [], "name": "Plum Duff", "overview": "One day in the \u60e3ear you had to have one over the eight. Santa Claus is tipsy and all the presents have been wrongly delivered. So by landing your sleigh on a roof it's back down the chimneys, taking care not to wake any of the little kids wandering around. Find the presents, pick them up by pressing the fire button and put them in the right stockings. Of course there is the added bonus of all the mince pies you can scoff and the extra wine you can drink. But beware, some people have no sense of occasion and the man-eating plants they have bought for their Mother's-In-Law may find you their first Christmas pudding! It's up to you to make sure the 32 kids in this particular street don't wake up to a Christmas that is nothing more than.....Plum Duff!", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Bug-Byte Software", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/122505-plum-duff\n"}
