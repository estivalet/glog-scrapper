{"altername_name": [], "name": "Amo del Mundo", "overview": "Among all the fantastic stories that I have known, one of the ones that has fascinated me the most is that of the Master of the World, a little-known novel by Jules Verne but that contains all the adventure and anticipation of the future that characterize this author. The \u00abEspanto\u00bb, a mechanical device capable of running like a car at high speed, flying like an airplane, sailing like a ship and turning into a submarine when the occasion calls for it, constitutes a challenge to modern civilization that, in full space age, he has not yet been able to build a similar artifact and perhaps, whoever succeeds, has a huge chance of truly becoming Master of the World. The novel is about a series of mysterious phenomena such as earthquakes, strange lights and noises that begin in the crater of a dormant volcano called Great-Eyry. The chief inspector of the Washington police, John Strock, is in charge of revealing their nature and then a unique adventure begins that will lead him to discover the \"Horror\", the amazing machine created by Robur the Conqueror, and the base of this one inside the crater of Great-Eyry.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Enrique Vives Martinez", "publishers": "Positive", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/132963-amo-del-mundo\n"}
