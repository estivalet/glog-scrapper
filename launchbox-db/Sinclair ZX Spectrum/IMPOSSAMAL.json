{"altername_name": [], "name": "IMPOSSAMAL", "overview": "Everybody knows that when it comes to impossible missions, only the best can be called upon. In this case, there were none available and they had to turn to Led Baratas, a famous pilot and bounty hunter who is currently unemployed. The mission consists of entering THE TUNNEL (Badajoz galaxy to the right) and collect the 10 PODEWWWR Cylinders, enough to persuade the GOD OF THE TUNNEL not to destroy the videogame-mal universe. You will control the IMPOSSAMAL ship, which looks like a bouncing ball but it's not, it's super high-tech and if you press down (or shoot) you make it bounce at a lower altitude. Try not to get pricked by the spikes or crash into the bad pellets or lasers. Break blocks to move forward and make your way through with the key cards you find. You have 10 lives, and you can reload along the way. Remember, that's 10 PODEWWWR cylinders... not one more, not one less. Give them to the GOD and run back to where you came from before the TUNNEL explodes.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "2023", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mojon Twins", "publishers": "Mojon Twins", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/368812-impossamal\n"}
