{"altername_name": [], "name": "After Shock", "overview": "An earthquake has caused devastation in the city, destroying buildings and killing many of its civilians. Although the earthquake was expected, it was thought that it would only be a minor one with minimum damage and not for decades to come, how wrong the experts were. Once the dust has settled it is realised that the nuclear power plant on the outskirts of the city is in a critical condition with the cooling-system needing repair. As the designer of the system, it is your job to get from your office in the heart of the city, make your way through the damaged streets and get inside the plant to repair the cooling-system. After Shock is a graphic text adventure where the screen has pictures showing what you see and also text describing your location. You type in commands with the keyboard to interact with your surroundings.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "David M.
