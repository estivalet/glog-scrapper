{"altername_name": [], "name": "Rockfall II", "overview": "The object of Rockfall 2 is to collect the required amount of jewels from each level; the number you need is shown in the bottom right-hand corner of the screen. When you've done that, an EXIT sign appears - usually in some hard-to-reach place - and you're whizzed off to the next level. When a game is finished and you've entered your high score into the table (which can be saved out) the title screen is displayed, showing the highest level reached. If you get past level zero you're asked which level you wish to be transported to - this can be any number between zero and the highest level you've reached.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Andrew Collier", "publishers": "Crash", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/122794-rockfall-ii\n"}
