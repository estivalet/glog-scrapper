{"altername_name": [], "name": "Microprose Soccer", "overview": "The game can simulate a full 11-a-side game of football on a grass pitch, or 6-a-side soccer,[2] based on the American indoor league of the time. A single player can work through a World Cup (or Indoor League) tournament, or take on a series of increasingly tougher computer teams. A two-player friendly can be played head to head. The control method was designed to be as simple as possible, lending itself to fast and flowing football (in the manner of the later Sensible Soccer). A quick tap of the fire button passed forward, a longer hold of the button chipped the ball at height. Pushing backwards and fire did an overhead kick. Pushing forwards and fire took a shot. Most unusual was the \"banana kick\", the strength of which could be varied among three settings in the options menu. By pushing diagonally as a shot was taken, the ball would swerve in the air to get round defenders and goalkeeper. Rival game Kick Off would also add this after-touch feature. Most versions featured a simulated \"action replay\" after a goal was scored, with the C64 version featuring black & white stripes to resemble a video rewinding.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "MicroProse Software", "publishers": "MicroProse Software", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/125135-microprose-soccer\n"}
