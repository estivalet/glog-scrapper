{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sir Fred", "overview": "Sir Fred, master swordsman, will come across various opponents whom he can only get past by killing with a sword or other weapons. When using the sword the up and down controls move the sword up and down through three positions and the left and right will attack or defend. When Sir Fred comes against an opponent the first one to move will take the initiative. The opponent must then place his sword in the same position or the first swordsman can attack. The more skillful the player, the shorter the reaction time allowed. There are seven skill levels, which the computer automatically selects. Sir Fred has to hurt his opponent three times to kill him, unless his opponent is trapped in a corner and cannot move backwards. In this case only one hit is needed. Sir Fred can also use the bow and arrows which he has collected. Once selected, press the use key to change the arrow through four different positions. If you want to throw a stone which you have collected, select it, then press the use key. The strength with which you throw depends on how long you hold down the key. The stone is thrown when you release the use key.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Made in Spain", "publishers": "Made in Spain", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/52426-sir-fred\n"}
