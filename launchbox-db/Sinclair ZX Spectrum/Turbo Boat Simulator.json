{"altername_name": [], "name": "Turbo Boat Simulator", "overview": "You are aboard a powerful boat, deep in enemy territory, and must get through this to make it back in one piece. To help you do this, allied planes drop pieces of the map onto the water, all of which must be collected to complete the level. Gameplay is side-scrolling, and the boat can be steered up and down the screen as well as accelerated in either direction. The waterways have many mounds and blockades in place, as in Spy Hunter. Enemy boats and planes shoot at you, and also drop mines.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78813-turbo-boat-simulator\n"}
