{"altername_name": [], "name": "Top Gun", "overview": "The Tom Cruise film featured an F-14 Tomcat plane, and this licensed game recreates this. Viewed from the cockpit in full 3D, the game is a straight head-to-head duel, against another player or the computer. You are armed with missiles (while put you in control of a small target zone, which must remain over your opponent for 3 seconds), flares and cannons (which overheat when overused)- use these more wisely than your opponent. Pay attention to speed and altitude too. The computer has 3 planes to throw at you, of which the last is the toughest, while each player in a 2-player game also has 3 'lives'.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ocean Software", "publishers": "Ocean Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/92139-top-gun\n"}
