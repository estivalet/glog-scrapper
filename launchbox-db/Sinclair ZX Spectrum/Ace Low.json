{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ace Low", "overview": "Ace Low is a card game where you are presented with ten cards turned down and after looking at the first card you must decide whether the next card is higher or lower. You start with \u00a310, with each game costing \u00a31, and if you manage to guess nine cards in a row then you win \u00a35. As the title suggests, aces are low but if the next card matches the last card then this is counted as a correct guess.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Richard Cobden", "publishers": "Cases Computer Simulations", "genres": "Casino", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.79", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gRmNLg1pZY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/105377-ace-low\n"}
