{"altername_name": [], "name": "Obliterator", "overview": "IS THIS THE LAST MISSION FOR THE LAST OBLITERATOR? Your personal communicator bleeps. A summons. The Federation Council of Elders want you. And they want you now. No time to pack - a Nuclonic inter-stellar shuttle is on its way to collect you - the last time this happened it took them three months to put your body back together again. You shudder - the adrenalin is pumping. You're tough, you're mean, and you're ready for action - but what's in store? Something big is about to break - the star fleet was on alert for days - then one morning it was gone, the whole fleet and no one knew where. The top brass have been running around with stark terror on their faces - no one knows why. And now they are going to tell you - the last of the Obliterators. Why? During the last war you and the unit you commanded were heroes - wherever the fighting was hottest and bloodiest who did they send? - the Obliterators of course, the most highly trained \u00e9lite lighting force ever assembled; each one recruited at birth from amongst the population of billions in Federation space; each one intensively trained and educated form childhood each one with a genetically enhanced body to speed up reflexes, enhance the senses and increase strength and agility.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Icon Design", "publishers": "Melbourne House", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obliterator", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/57224-obliterator\n"}
