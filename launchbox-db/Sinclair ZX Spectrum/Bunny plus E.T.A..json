{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bunny plus E.T.A.", "overview": "Bunny plus E.T.A. is a compilation of two games. Bunny is an Easter-themed top down maze game. The player has to guide their bunny round the maze, collecting Easter eggs, and avoiding the hazards. To move to the next level the player must enter the exit game that appears randomly for a short time. Every few levels there is a bonus stage where the player must deliver the eggs collected to houses under a time limit, and then complete another maze to get to the Easter basket. The game has two difficulty levels, which changes the design of the maze. E.T.A. Is inspired by the 1982 film E.T. the Extra Terrestrial. The main goal is to lead the Eta to his spaceship without letting his life support batteries running out. The game is composed by two parts with different genres. The 1st is a text puzzle where the player has to guess the correct letters of Eta's name and how many legs and arms he has. For each attempt a portion of Eta's life support is lost. The 2nd is a maze action genre where the player first has to reunite with Eta and then lead him to the spaceship. Neither the player or the Eta alone can catch the spaceship at the initial phase, they have to move together. The spaceship is constantly changing its position and at the last phase the police will try to capture them.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Automata U.K.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/167060-bunny-plus-eta\n"}
