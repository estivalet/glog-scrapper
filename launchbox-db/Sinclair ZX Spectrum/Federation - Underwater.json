{"altername_name": [], "name": "Federation: Underwater", "overview": "Far away, in a parallel universe, there is a world identical to our planet, but with all its continents completely submerged. Its name is Earth-2. The Zork Federation wants to conquer that universe, and the key is invading that world. The Zork Federation, with the aid of the Earthling Koji Bakuto (see our previous game \"Federation Z\") has completely conquered its own universe, and now has put its efforts in invading the pacific parallel universe where Earth-2 is located. Koji, feeling guilty, transmitted an S.O.S. to the Earth. Unfortunately, the message arrived to a different universe, exactly to the pond where Peter Parrish (see the previous game \"The Doom of the Pond\") was celebrating the liberation of the god Heyoka with the Reticulans. Parrish, her business partner Madame Suellen and the turtles are sent to the Earth-2 universe in order to stop this madness. It will not be easy! Besides, there is a strange legend widespread all over the city-states of Earth-2. It says that a long time ago a very powerful other-wordly being left in a secret place a sealed dome named \u201cEnigmatik\u2019s seal\u201d. It is said that inside that dome there is a trapped serpent god, and that there are three Trololo Kings living in three mythical golden cities that are able to break the seal and unleash the god.
