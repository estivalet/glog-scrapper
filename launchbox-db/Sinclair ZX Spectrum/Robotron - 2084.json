Your job is simple: save humanity from their own creation -- the ROBOTRONS! The gameplay is pretty unique for the time. You can move and fire in any of eight directions. You get thrown in a room with various evil baddies strewn about, you've got to kill all the robots while at the same time finding some way to grab humans and avoid death.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Paul Holmes", "publishers": "Atarisoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151209-robotron-2084\n"}
