{"altername_name": [], "name": "Maze Chase", "overview": "Maze Chase. The program is in the Pac-man mould but is very addictive and difficult to play. The manufacturer says the game has four mazes on the 16K version and 12 on the 48K. We have managed to get through only the first few mazes as the game is so difficult. The player must eat the energy pills and lemons while staying away from the evil guardians. If a magic strawberry is eaten the guardians will lose their power and you can eat them.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Pete Cooke", "publishers": "Dorling Kindersley Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/55590-maze-chase\n"}
