{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Charm", "overview": "The Charm is a retro platformer in which you play as Sir Oup, a Knight of the kingdom who is on a quest to break the evil that has taken over the land. It won't be easy though as many strange creatures, spikes and nasty traps will try to block your quest, yet that's what adds to the fun of this game. Your little guy can jump, duck, shoot his way through the levels and pick up items to solve puzzles all in a fantastic game of great retro detail of which there is plenty of. From waterfalls, to the platform landscape, this is a high quality game indeed, so well worth playing!", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "2014", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "retroworks", "publishers": "Retroworks", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151282-the-charm\n"}
