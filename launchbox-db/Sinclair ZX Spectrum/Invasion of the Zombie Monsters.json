After an amazing day, during which their institute club obtained the Science Olympiad 1st award for the fourth time in a row, the happy couple can at last relax at the city cliff, looking at a fantastic star-filled night sky. But the happiness will not last as long as they expected... Suddenly, a thunderbolt fell from the sky and hit Ned's car. When Ned managed to react, he saw a horrible image: a huge evil shadow had fallen over the city and kidnapped Linda. The evil being just hid itself into the city High, taking Ned's girlfriend with it, and creating chaos and darkness in the whole town! Ned, still stunned by the thunderbolt attack, thought it would be the end for everyone... But when evil forces rise over the good ones, the moon casts a spell on the hero, the chosen one, the one destined to save us all. And the moon cast its power ray on Ned, who felt strange and full of power again! Now, with his new powers, he will start his quest to save his girl and finish off the bad one.
