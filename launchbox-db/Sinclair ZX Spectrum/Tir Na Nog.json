{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tir Na Nog", "overview": "Tir Na Nog is an arcade-adventure game. The player controlling the hero as he wanders the land of Tir Na Nog collecting objects, solving puzzles and trying to keep out of the way of the s\u00eddhe who also wander the land. Many of the puzzles that Cuchulainn is set are cryptic in nature (e.g. \"The backdoor key is me\") rather than straightforward and may rely on some lateral thinking. Because he is in an afterlife, Cuchulainn cannot die and if he is \"defeated\" by a s\u00eddhe he is simply transported elsewhere and loses all his carried objects. The Land of Tir Na Nog is very large and consists of plains, caverns and forests. Cuchulainn can move north, south, east and west with the player \"rotating\" the view using the keyboard and then having Cuchulainn move left or right on the screen. The player can collect any objects they come across with Cuchulainn being able to carry several at one time. Some of these objects can be used as weapons with the game allowing the player to \"thrust\" with any item.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Carter Follis Software Associates", "publishers": "Gargoyle Games", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tir_Na_Nog_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/53442-tir-na-nog\n"}
