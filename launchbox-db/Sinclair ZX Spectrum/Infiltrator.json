{"altername_name": [], "name": "Infiltrator", "overview": "Infiltrator is a combination of first-person helicopter simulator and isometric third-person espionage action. You, as Johnny McGibbitts, ace pilot and neurosurgeon, were given a mission against the \"Mad Leader\". You have to fly in a helicopter behind enemy lines and make a diversion there. You can fool the choppers into believing that you are one of the bad guys, and also you can show false documents to guards in the enemy camp. If they aren't fooled then you can use a spray of sleeping gas or even a grenade. There are many houses in the camp, which have many rooms containing useful items, but you won't be able to get them all because of the time limit for the operation.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Chris Gray", "publishers": "Erbe Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infiltrator_%28video_game%29", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aTKVBVlkhA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/112481-infiltrator\n"}
