{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cosmic Debris", "overview": "Cosmic Debris is an archetypal clone of Asteroids. The player controls a spacecraft in the middle of an alien asteroid belt and must destroy all the asteroids to survive. The asteroids start off large and when you shoot one then it splits into multiple smaller asteroids, each of which are destroyed in one shot and new asteroids appear perpetually. Occasionally alien space ships appear that can be shot for points. You can rotate your ship 360 degrees as well as thrust forward and hyperspace into a random location on screen in a pinch. If you are hit by an asteroid or by shrapnel from a destroyed asteroid, then you lose a life. The game speed can selected, fast and suicidal. An extra live is awarded every 10,000 points.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jon Ritman", "publishers": "Artic Computing", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/q1CaCCSKd8A", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147583-cosmic-debris\n"}
