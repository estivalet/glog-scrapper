{"altername_name": ["Horacio y las Ara\u00f1as", "Horace and the Spiders"], "name": "Horace & the Spiders", "overview": "In 1983, Tang produced the third title in the series, Horace and the Spiders. This was primarily a platform game with the Horace sprite retained from the first two games. The first level sees Horace climbing a hill while jumping over spiders. The second level involves crossing a bridge by swinging on spider threads. The third level is the final confrontation with the spiders \u2013 he must create holes in the web, luring the spiders into the holes to fix them and consequently jumping on them. Unlike the earlier two titles, this game was only released for the ZX Spectrum. The first stage of this game shared similarities with both Pitfall and the Colecovision game Smurf: Rescue in Gargamel's Castle, whilst the third platform stage is essentially a Space Panic clone. It's the only official Horace game that never got officially released on any other platform. It was exclusively released on the Spectrum.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Beam Software", "publishers": "Sinclair Research", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horace_series#Horace_and_the_Spiders", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ua3aAWzoCs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/17379-horace-the-spiders\n"}
