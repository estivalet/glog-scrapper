You are at the bottom amred with a Magnum Laser which punches holes in the wall (gaingin points as you go). However, the alien has its own protection - a solid Tungstidium Barrier which often save it. Secondly, there is a row of white aliens which can withstand two blasts of your laser (they turn black when hit once). Finally time is on the alien's side because yout time is limited, so don't spend too much time smashing the bricks in the wall. The time left is indicated by a white line at the base of the screen. The alien is worth 1000 points.
