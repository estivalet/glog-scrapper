{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Prince", "overview": "The Prince is an interactive role-playing game of strategy and adventure for four players and 17 computer controlled \u201cplayers\u201d. It represents a real challenge to the resourcefulness of the players, since it pits them not only against computer-generated difficulties but also against each other; the interactions which take place between the players away from the keyboard are as important as the interaction between player and computer.
