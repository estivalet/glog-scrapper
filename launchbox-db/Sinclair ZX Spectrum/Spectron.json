{"altername_name": [], "name": "Spectron", "overview": "You are the latest in a long line of SPECTRON fighting robots and your only aim in life is to survive; to survive in an arena filled with hostile enemy robots. Armed with a rapid fire laser gun you must blast these mindless machines into clouds of vaporised metal and silicon chips as they move relentlessly towards you. Your reactions will need to be at their peak to survive in this hostile environment, with 4 different strains of robots, each with their own movement characteristics and attack strategies, including the deadly homing missile. To make existence even more difficult an increasing number of electrified fences are placed in the arena as the game progresses to reduce the manoeuvring space. With up to 54 robots and missiles on the screen at the same time and an ever increasing speed, SPECTRON is a game which wilt NEVER be beaten no matter how proficient you may become.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "The Code Monkeys", "publishers": "Virgin Games", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/b2WWjoqRV6g", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148543-spectron\n"}
