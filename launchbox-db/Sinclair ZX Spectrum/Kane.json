{"altername_name": [], "name": "Kane", "overview": "There are four fairly distinct sections to this Wild West themed action game, two involving shooting and two putting you on horseback. The first level involves shooting at birds, with a minimum of 3 required to progress. You must aim in front of the birds, so as to allow for the distance they will cover as the bullet travels. In the third level you are now shooting at bad guys, who emerge from locations (bank, saloon, store) on an accurate Wild West layout. The second level sees you attempting to jump over rocks and cacti, whereas level 4 involves jumping across a speeding train in order to wrestle control of it.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mastertronic", "publishers": "Mastertronic", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.62", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kane_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0eylymKF2I", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106974-kane\n"}
