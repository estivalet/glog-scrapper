The bird Sqij has to find the six pieces of the Enertree which are scattered over the caverns of Pylpapa and bring them to the Lotz-Too-Weet cave where he can rebuild the Enertree and get in this way everlasting life. A conversion of a Commodore 64 title, the ZX Spectrum version of SQIJ! was built in roughly 40 hours time. Sole programmer Jason Creighton had become a disgruntled employee with no interest in turning in a finished product, but had his hand forced due to contractual obligation. Due to a programming error wherein the game can only accept input from lowercase keys / does not acknowledge input of Caps Lock, the game has a reputation for being quite literally \"unplayable.\" However, using a single poke command (\"POKE 23568,0\"), control can be properly re-enabled in-game.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "The Power House", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90912-sqij\n"}
