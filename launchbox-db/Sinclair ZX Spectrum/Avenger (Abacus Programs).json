Viewed from the side with the screen scrolling left to right constantly, you will also encounter alien ships firing at you as well as missiles but these can be shot with your laser. Overuse of your laser though will make it overheat and you will be unable to use it for a short time. If you are hit by any bullets, missiles or hit the surface then you lose either one or two shields from five and if your shields run out then you lose one of five lives. Scattered on the surface are Atomic Power Stations and these must not be destroyed or you will blow up the planet and lose a life. There are five skill levels (1-5) with one being the easiest.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kevin Flynn", "publishers": "Abacus Programs", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.93", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kff3dXlbB1g", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/117705-avenger-abacus-programs\n"}
