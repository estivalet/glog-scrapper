{"altername_name": [], "name": "Frenzy (Quicksilva)", "overview": "Frenzy is an unofficial port of Frenzy, the sequel to Berzerk. The game puts the player into one-screen labyrinths surrounded by lethal walls which have passages to other labyrinths at every side. In each labyrinth, there are several types of enemies which will become more diversified and harder to destroy or evade while the game is unfolding. Each time the player goes through a passage, a new level is generated. The player is provided with a laser gun that can be fired in eight directions and is effective against most of the enemies. The enemies include 5 types of robots with different levels of difficulty represented by different colours, machinery that dumps mines on the ground, vehicles that will fragment themselves into multiple flying machines and finally, a sphere that will relentlessly pursuit the player if he stays in a single scenario for too long. The dropped mines, the flying machines and the sphere are indestructable.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "David Shea", "publishers": "Quicksilva", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/119547-frenzy-quicksilva\n"}
