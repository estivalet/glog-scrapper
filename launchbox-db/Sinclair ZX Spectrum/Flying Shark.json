Certain waves of enemy airplanes produce bonuses when shot down, such as powerups, point bonuses, and extra lives. Each stage begins and ends at a runway, and every time the player lands at a runway beyond the first takeoff, the amount of bombs multiply 3,000 points to the player's total score. The player gets 3 bombs at the start of each stage (or death).
