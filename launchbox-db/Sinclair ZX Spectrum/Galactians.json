{"altername_name": [], "name": "Galactians", "overview": "Galactians is a clone of the arcade classic Galaxian. The player controls a spacecraft at the bottom of the screen, moving left or right to destroy the alien invaders above by firing shots from the craft. The aliens sit at the top and on occasion break formation to swoop down to attack you, dropping bombs to destroy you. The player has several options that affect the difficulty of gameplay before the game starts, such as making the enemies invisible while in formation, altering the speed of the bombs they drop and making your shots guided, rather than going in a straight line.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "David Turner", "publishers": "dk'tronics", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.9", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXfhHJKQaao", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/120847-galactians\n"}
