{"altername_name": [], "name": "Jogger", "overview": "Unlike the Oric version, and despite sharing the same name and publisher, Jogger on the ZX Spectrum is an unorthodox Frogger clone where you play as a jogger who must cross a road and a river. However, there is a number of differences to Frogger apart from the fact that you control a jogger: The road runs in the middle of the river, so you start by crossing the river, then the road, and then the river once more. In the river, you don't jump on turtles or crocodiles. Instead, you wade or swim, and must stay away from barges and crocodiles. In the middle of the road is a reservation where a man mows the grass. He must also be avoided.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mike Howard", "publishers": "Severn Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HhPeb5sTIrE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148275-jogger\n"}
