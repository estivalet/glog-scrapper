{"altername_name": [], "name": "Vagan Attack", "overview": "As a Federation Commander, you are in control of your Andromeda ship when the warrior Vagan race attacks. Only your quick man-management and combat strategy nous can save your presence in the galaxy (made up of 4096 sectors across the 64 quadrants) in this Star Trek-influenced game. At all stages many commands are available to you, which are typed in using 2 letter codes. Instructions include activating the propulsion engines, firing one of your weapons, viewing the scanner to get either a short- or long-range view of the area, or viewing a damage report. Your supply of weaponry is recharged and damage repaired by docking at a Starbase. Time passes as you make your decisions, and attacks on Starbases must be warded off within set time limits.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "John Green", "publishers": "Atlantis Software Ltd.", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBXvXR6vAIY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/104597-vagan-attack\n"}
