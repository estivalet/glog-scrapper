Finding these and reassembling the car is done in several stages. First you must find a magnifying glass, and use this to examine the screens thoroughly to find each part. Once you obtain the car part, you will need a spanner to be able to do anything with it. Armed with these, you must head to the basement, to be able to put it back together. Bonus items can be found, ranging from essential keys and candlelight recharges to extra lives and telephones.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ionis Software International", "publishers": "Cartoon Time", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkWz18hweec", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113197-olli-lissa-3\n"}
