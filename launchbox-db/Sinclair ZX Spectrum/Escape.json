{"altername_name": [], "name": "Escape", "overview": "Player has to search a maze for an axe, which will allow him to break the exit, and escape. He is chased by initially a single monster - each successful escape increases the number of monsters roaming the maze, until level 5, which introduces a pterosaur that will occasionally take off and fly over the hedges, not being restricted to the maze paths. Upon finding the axe, which is randomly placed for each level, the player speed slows down allowing the monsters to catch up.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Malcolm Evans", "publishers": "New Generation Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/84908-escape\n"}
