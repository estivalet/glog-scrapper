{"altername_name": [], "name": "Rat-A-Tat", "overview": "Ratty always wanted to visit London and one day he got the chance to hitch a ride on a Jumbo out of Manchester, and he took it. Unfortunately the decision to stow away for free in the cargo hold turned out to be the worst decision he'd ever made. During a terrible storm the cargo doors of the plane blew open and Ratty and his suitcase tumbled out of the plane. Ratty parachuted to safety but his tat (aka. luggage) had been scattered all over the city. He'd never visited London before but now Ratty was required to explore every nook and cranny of the huge capital in an effort to recover all of his lost items. Not great timing as his tummy was rumbling and he was so very hungry, having not had chance to scoff an airport meal, being a stow away and all. Can you help Ratty recover all his luggage before the poor mite pops his clogs due to cheez needz?", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "2020", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Joesoft", "publishers": "Joesoft", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151052-rat-a-tat\n"}
