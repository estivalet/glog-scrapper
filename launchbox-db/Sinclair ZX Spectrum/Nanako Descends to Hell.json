{"altername_name": [], "name": "Nanako Descends to Hell", "overview": "Nanako thought that her life would be easy after she rescued her younger sister from the Monster Castle, but as soon as she got to her home village, she met the evil Yh\u00f3p-Uthas wreaking havoc and destroying everything\u2026 again. And when the Yh\u00f3p-Uthas were not busy breaking necks and burning houses, the Kah-Vronn-Azhos were, or the Tuj-Muer-Tso-Ts\u00f3, or even the Myby Ka-Gahn-T\u00f3\u2026 Nobody seemed to take Nanako\u2018s village seriously, so Nanako decided that the situation had to change. The first thing Nanako did was getting incredibly angry and stomp forcefully her feet against the floor but, as such relieving action didn\u2019t solve a thing, she decided to go see the Oracle. The guy, of inmense wisdom, advised her to go to Hell to look for 4 pieces of an ancient artifact which would turn to ashes any offender tribe which would attack the village. Nanako didn\u2019t find that strange at all (we all know that in Hell you can find such kind of things), so she took her way down to Hell!", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "2009", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "The Mojon Twins", "publishers": "The Mojon Twins", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/150697-nanako-descends-to-hell\n"}
