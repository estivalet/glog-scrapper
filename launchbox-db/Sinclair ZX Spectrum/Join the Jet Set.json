{"altername_name": [], "name": "Join the Jet Set", "overview": "Having woken up from his deep sleep, our intrepid hero is keen to explore the surrounding countryside. Whilst Willy would dearly love to join the jet-set, funding the upkeep of a mansion is no mean feat, and Willy needs more resources if he is going to hobnob with royalty. Therefore, he buys himself a crash helmet (not that it's very effective) and sails off to a nearby island with a central mountain. The game starts with Willy in the palace of the mountain's royal resident. He must collect all the valuables from inside the mountain, the surrounding trees and gardens, and from the local town. He must also fly through the sky, go to sea, and even take a trip to hell and back! Join the Jet Set is a contender for the very first JSW rom hack and is therefore an important piece of the history of the Jet Set Willy fan community.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Halsoft", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165221-join-the-jet-set\n"}
