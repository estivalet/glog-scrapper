{"altername_name": ["Saboteur"], "name": "Saboteur!", "overview": "Saboteur combines platform, beat 'em up and stealth elements, setting you as a lone samurai trying to infiltrate an enemy complex. You are capable of all manner of ninja-style moves including kicks and punches, as well as using weaponry. You must travel through an underground complex linked mainly by platforms and ladders, before triggering a bomb and escaping the complex. Your energy recharges if you stay still, so finding areas free of guards (kill these for money) and dogs (avoid them; killing them gains you nothing) is useful, especially as you only have one life. There's plenty of object manipulation involved, although only one item can ever be carried at a time.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Durell Software", "publishers": "Durell Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.3", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saboteur_(1985_video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/16886-saboteur\n"}
