{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bomber Pengo", "overview": "Immerse yourself in the captivating world of Bomber Pengo, an engaging platformer puzzler developed by Gabriele Amore. Journey through a series of carefully crafted single-screen levels as you take control of an adorable penguin, on a mission to collect a variety of hearts. To overcome the challenges in your path, strategically use bombs to clear obstacles (not enemies, as they are invincible) and create temporary platforms, allowing you to reach the coveted hearts. Navigate the game with precision using the Q, O, and P keys. Press Q to look upward, P to move right, and O to move left. You can also execute sharp turns by combining Q with O or Q with P. Time is your nemesis, and your ability to think on your feet is your greatest advantage.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "2023", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiUHugHnDOY&t=104s", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/373494-bomber-pengo\n"}
