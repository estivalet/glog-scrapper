{"altername_name": [], "name": "Brian and the Dishonest Politician", "overview": "Brian and the Dishonest Politician is a humorous text adventure. Brian Ramsbottom is pretty sure that Garth Pitchfork, this year's candidate for the seat of Lower Ruddleston, is dodgy. Some would say he's as bent as a big bent thing. So in the run up to the elections he decides to stand against Gareth Pitchfork. The thing is Garth is promising big things for Lower Ruddleston, to whit a massive donation to 'Haemorrhoid Research'. This is a two part game. At the start of part two, the player is asked a question about something that happens at the end of part one. In part one the player must help enough of the local residents to get the ten votes needed to win the election and in part two you must gather the evidence needed to convict Garth Pitchfork. This game was developed using Professional Adventure Writer. It supports the standard shortcuts such as N/S/E/W for North/South/East/West as well X for EXAMINE.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "The Spud", "publishers": "Delbert the Hamster Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/105035-brian-and-the-dishonest-politician\n"}
