{"altername_name": ["Gridrunner 2: Matrix", "Matrix"], "name": "Matrix: Gridrunner 2", "overview": "Matrix: Gridrunner 2 is the sequel to Gridrunner. In this Centipede style game you play a retired captain of a starship, one of those who had won the previous war against aliens. You come out of retirement because the aliens are back, tougher than ever. Thus a second gridwar begins. You pilot your ship and shoot at chains of pods coming at you. As you hit the pods, they break into smaller independent chains. The aliens seem to have a sense of humor, though. Each pod in the chain coming at you looks like a...camel.
