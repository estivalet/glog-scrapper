The main character can jump, punch, and kick, just like the enemies. While the kick has a slightly longer range, the punch is a little faster. To gain an advantage over the enemies, it is possible to pick up various weapons including a machine-gun, throwing knives, or shurikens. Ammunition for all weapons is limited. Unlike many similar fighting games, there are no end-of-level bosses in the game.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kevin Parker", "publishers": "Players Software", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/104995-shanghai-warriors\n"}
