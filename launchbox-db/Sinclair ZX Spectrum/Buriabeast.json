{"altername_name": [], "name": "Buriabeast", "overview": "The back story to this game is that as the last remaining member of the human race it's your task to defend the earth from the invading marauding mutant KENS. To accomplish this task you have a single tool, a shovel. Thus begins a thirteen level game of ladders and platforms through which you must dig holes for the KENS to fall through, luring them into the traps if you must. The aliens start off green. Once they fall though the first hole they become red. Get them to fall through a second hole and they become white. Get them to fall through a third and that finishes them off. There are controls for left / right / up / down, along with dig, fill and pause.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Matthew Dowell", "publishers": "Kerian UK Ltd", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/117992-buriabeast\n"}
