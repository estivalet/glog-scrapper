{"altername_name": ["Strider 2"], "name": "Strider II", "overview": "Strider has been called into action to save the people of the planet Magenta, armed with a Gyro laser and matter converter. He must fight his way through a forest, a ruined city, underground colonies, a roof-top battle, and finally the prison ship in which the Megantan leader is held. The gameplay is similar to the original, consisting of running, jumping and attacking, with a very dynamic central character. The laser gun can be used while standing still; moving attacks with the sword are still possible, with the two weapons combining similarly to the Switchblade games. Tokens can be collected, which will turn you into a robot to face the end-of-level enemies if enough are collected.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Tiertex", "publishers": "Erbe Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.3", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strider_II_(1990_video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGJrDAhgzhg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/104162-strider-ii\n"}
