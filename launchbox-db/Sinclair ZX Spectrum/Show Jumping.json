{"altername_name": ["Show Jumping"], "name": "Show Jumping", "overview": "The smartly-dressed and graceful world of Show Jumping is recreated here, with support for up to 8 human players. There are six courses of increasing difficulty. Before taking to the course you get a plan-view of the course, with the hazards lettered to indicate the order in which they must be taken. There is a 100-second time limit on each course, with 20 penalty points resulting in disqualification. Hitting a hazard triggers a four-point penalty, while the horse refusing a jump leads to a three-point penalty - three of those means automatic disqualification. The action is side-viewed, with the horse rotated 30 degrees by pushing left or right, with timing the jumps crucial.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "IMS software", "publishers": "IMS Software", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113255-show-jumping\n"}
