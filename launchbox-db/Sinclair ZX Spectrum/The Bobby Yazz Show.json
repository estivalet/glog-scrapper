{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Bobby Yazz Show", "overview": "The Bobby Yazz show - rated 85% by Crash, but never released due to the intended publishers going bankrupt. This the action puzzler is set under the premise of a futuristic TV game-show, hosted by the madcap Bobby Yazz. The gameplay is divided into four distinct types of levels, with restart points after every 8 stages, and some amusing adverts (for products such as \"Soapo Plus. Better than our last rubbish. It almost works\" and \"Kill 'Em - the nuclear game for all ages\"). The first level involves moving around a maze so as to colour in every square. Flying around the levels are droids which rub out any sectors they hit, but can be killed by touching them. The third level is similar, only now you must touch a few squares (those with keys on) but the enemies are fatal to the touch. Both these levels have a number of power-ups available, via big bubbles to collect. The second level type involves trying to navigate through a blind path, with the squares revealing themselves as you move through them. After each of the three main levels, you get to a bonus level, in which green tokens appear for a limited period of time, and a certain number must be collected to get a bonus.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Cybadyne", "publishers": "Crash", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/103070-the-bobby-yazz-show\n"}
