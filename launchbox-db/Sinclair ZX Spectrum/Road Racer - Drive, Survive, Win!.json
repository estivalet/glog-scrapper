{"altername_name": ["Road Racer"], "name": "Road Racer: Drive, Survive, Win!", "overview": "Road Racer is a racing/driving game and a variant of the classic Pole Position for Arcade. Qualification is not required for a player to be allowed to race in this game, he simply has to finish each lap with a remaining life. The conduction itself is also not considered an obstacle because the car will never get off road. The only thing the player has to worry about is to avoid crashing against other opponents and specially while trying to overrun them or vice-versa. The overruns become increasingly more difficult for each successfully completed lap as much as the speed will increase exponentially. For each lap a flag is earned.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Thorn EMI", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/115342-road-racer-drive-survive-win\n"}
