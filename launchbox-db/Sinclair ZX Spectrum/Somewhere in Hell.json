{"altername_name": [], "name": "Somewhere in Hell", "overview": "Father Jeremiah was a good shepherd. Entirely delivered to his church and his parishioners. That morning he was getting ready for his Sunday Mass, just as he has been doing for so many years. But this morning was not the usual; he could notice something really strange in the environment. Something impregnated in a putrid stench that, even today, can\u2019t be removed from his mind. The smell of Death\u2026 He ran to the doors of his parish alarmed by the groans and guttural screams that came from outside and opened them. Not in his worst nightmares could he have imagined such scene: faithful parishioners soaked in blood walked the square where his parish was located. In the eyes of some of them he could see the most terrible horrors\u2026 they were no longer people. He didn\u2019t even want to imagine what they were, although this idea came to his mind over and over again. Those creatures invaded everything. As fas as he could reach, there was no trace of life left.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "2021", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Packobilly", "publishers": "Packobilly", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/150422-somewhere-in-hell\n"}
