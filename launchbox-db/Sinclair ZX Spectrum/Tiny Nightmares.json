{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tiny Nightmares", "overview": "Tiny Nightmares is an action-adventure game for Spectrum 48k. This game is inspired in the succesful indie video game Little Nightmares developed by Tarsier Studios . Tiny Nightmares is so far from Little Nightmares, because this game has a very special atmosphere and style of game, that it would be hard to replicate in a 8 bits computer as ZX Spectrum, so Tiny Nightmares is closer to the classic adventures of 80's as Pyjamarama. Anyway, Tiny Nightmare is inspired by this great indie game, and it tries to bring a piece of its universe to Sinclair's computer.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "2023", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "EJVG", "publishers": "EJVG", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/371387-tiny-nightmares\n"}
