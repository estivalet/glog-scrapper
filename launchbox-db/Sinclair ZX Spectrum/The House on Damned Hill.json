{"altername_name": [], "name": "The House on Damned Hill", "overview": "The aim of the game is to try and get to the room in the old house where a maiden is being held captive. The house consists of four floors, cellars, ground floor, 1st floor and attics. In the house are lots of creatures, some of which can be friendly whilst others are definitely not. Also in the house are objects, of which some are needed to progress, whilst others are of no use (common sense rules here). Also in the game is a clock - a time limit is imposed. This clock is shown all the time wjen in a room. Another factor to take into account is strength, the player has only a certain amount and loses some every time he moves! But strength can be gained by dropping objects, or gambling some of your strength in a fight with a monster. For the unwary are traps - some of which can be gotten out of (if the right objects are being carried), and some of which are fatal - BEWARE!", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Century City Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148188-the-house-on-damned-hill\n"}
