{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sam Stoat: Safebreaker", "overview": "As all is quiet and everyone's asleep Sam sets out to exercise his stealth and cunning - robbing the rich of their valuable jewels - one greedy Sam Stoat. A master craftsman, nothing bars his way, no safe can resist his explosive talents. That is until he enters Gremlin Lane where the houses are protected by watchdogs of a kind Sam has never encountered before. An army of gnomes, vicious and nasty, lovable and drunk, a policeman with his cast of bouncing bed springs and runaway pool balls and the terrorizing hunger of the blood-thirsty bats and fat black spiders. Sam is pleased for the calming effect of Stoat Healing Elixir as he battles his way forward in search of the diamond on which a nerve-shattered Stoat can end his days.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Peter M.
