Your starship is locked into geostationary orbit above Roba, a volcanic island on Zyro. Repeated attempts to land a survey unit have fallen to laser attacks from the surface. One android has survived a crash and awaits your command. He stands alone amid the wreckage on a small island west of Roba. He is your only hope of completing your mission. You must watch him on your video-scanner and direct his actions. Be sure to think quickly - this is a real-time adventure.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Docimodus", "publishers": "Terminal Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/Q7FYiLnn1rY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148538-space-island\n"}
