The game is essentially several implementations of Tetris. There is even a clone of Space Invaders, in which you shoot at Tetris blocks descending the screen instead of traditional aliens. Clones of Pole Position and Snake using Tetris blocks are also included. The game was developed and self-published by Gusmanb on December 2, 2020. The game was physically released for a brief period, before being made free.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "December 2, 2020", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gusmanb", "publishers": "Gusmanb", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpwcxj2eTH4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/169854-multigame-9999-in-1\n"}
