{"altername_name": [], "name": "Armageddon (Silversoft)", "overview": "Armageddon is a clone of the arcade game Missile Command. In this single screen shooter you are the commander of three planetary defence missile batteries and your mission is to protect six cities. You move a cross-hair around the screen and fire a limited supply of missiles from each battery aimed to explode in front of approaching nuclear missiles that come from the top of the screen to destroy them. If a nuclear missile hits a city then it is destroyed and once all cities are destroyed, then it is game over.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Silversoft", "publishers": "Silversoft", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/167916-armageddon-silversoft\n"}
