{"altername_name": [], "name": "Kliatba noci", "overview": "A long time ago, sometime at the beginning of the 16th century, a famous and rich castle stood in the middle of the Valley of the Night. The name of the gorge was coined by the inhabitants of the castle themselves, who noticed that the night lasts much longer here than in other parts. One cold morning, three criminals visited the kingdom, and from that moment on, the peaceful life of the inhabitants began to slowly disappear. When the rampage of the outcasts exceeded all limits, King Michael had the order issued to capture and execute the criminals. Just before the execution, the criminals put a terrible curse on the king, which did not take long to come, and after about a month, strange things began to happen in the castle. The subjects and servants of the king gradually began to disappear, and in their place only their living skeletons began to appear in various places of the castle. The curse also affected the king himself, who jumped from the castle tower in a state of madness. The only living being in the castle remained the princess, who fell into an eternal sleep. She can only be saved by the one who uses a magical weapon to kill all the spirits of the executed criminals and prepare a magical elixir in the alchemist's workshop that will bring the princess back to life.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "DSA Computer Graphics", "publishers": "Ultrasoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmUSsixSE-0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165820-kliatba-noci\n"}
