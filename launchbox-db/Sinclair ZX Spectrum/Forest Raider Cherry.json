{"altername_name": [], "name": "Forest Raider Cherry", "overview": "Cherry picking. It was once such a nice, gentle past-time. No matter what the season, it was always possible to gather the fruits of nature and make jam from granny's family recipe, while she remained in the cottage and knitted scarves for the local fawns. But the Mysterious Forest has changed since granny's day, and now every step from the woodland path is a dangerous venture. A whole load of beasties have taken residence in the woods, including Sinister Snakes, Rabid Rabbits, and Beastly Bats, so fruity conserve is the last thing on your mind. It's not just the beasties that are new here. Dark magic now prevails, but you have decided to use it to your advantage. Collect enough cherries, and gems will sprout from the ground. Quickly now, for the clock is ticking and you have a fortune to gather. Maybe then you can procure the assistance of some hunky hero, to rid the forest of this menace!
