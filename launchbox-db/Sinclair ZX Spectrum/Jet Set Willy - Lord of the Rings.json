{"altername_name": [], "name": "Jet Set Willy: Lord of the Rings", "overview": "Taking over a year and a half of development time, Jet Set Willy: Lord of the Rings is a homage to both Jet Set Willy and the classic Tolkien series of novels. Each room is based on a different chapter of one of the books. Taking on the role of Frodo Baggins, your task is to unmake the One Ring created by the Dark Lord Sauron. To do this he must cast the Ring into the fires in which it was forged, in Mount Doom in the land of Mordor. If the Ring is unmade, Sauron will be vanquished forever; if Sauron regains possession of the Ring, he will rule Middle-earth forever and turn it all to evil and darkness. While Frodo is the main character, there is the opportunity to play as other characters in some of the later rooms. To complete the game, you have to collect the 256 flashing items distributed across the rooms, which makes Sauron disappear. Then you can get through the Barad-dur, and make for the Grey Havens. After you go over the sea, you can return to Mordor and unmake the Ring by running - not walking - into the fire of Mount Doom. Available as both 'Hard' and Easy' versions - this was truly a magnum opus and another example of how creative the JSW rom hacking community could be.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "2000", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Broadsoft", "publishers": "", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNz3efJS9H8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165218-jet-set-willy-lord-of-the-rings\n"}
