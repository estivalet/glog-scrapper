{"altername_name": ["Casino Royal"], "name": "Ca$ino Royal", "overview": "Casino Royal features two gambling games: Roulette and Pontoon (blackjack). Roulette is played by up to 6 people. When joining the table each player is given \u00a3500 worth in chips they must then use to place bets on the table, trying to predict which numbers will be produced by the roulette wheel. Pontoon is played alone against the bank. The player starts with a capital of \u00a3100 and must aim, when adding the value of the cards in their hands, to get a count of 21, or as near as possible of 21, without going over. Both games can take advantage of the Currah Microspeech extension to provide optional digitized sound effects.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Oxford Computer Publishing", "genres": "Casino", "max_players": "6", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147499-caino-royal\n"}
