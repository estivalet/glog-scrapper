{"altername_name": [], "name": "Rainy Day", "overview": "Rainy Day is a collection of three games that contains the following: Puzzle: A sliding puzzle game where you are presented with two pictures which are the same but the picture on the right is scrambled into 24 squares and one empty square. You move squares into the empty square to move the squares into the right places and match the picture on the left before a timer reaches zero. There are a choice of nine pictures to play. Codebreaker: Based on the game of Mastermind, you have to open a safe by choosing the right combination of five numbers made up of ten numbers (0-9) in the correct order in less than 15 attempts and before a timer reaches zero. Once you have selected your five numbers, the computer tells you which ones are correct in the right place and which ones are correct but in the wrong place. There are three difficulty levels (1-3) to choose. Reaction Tester: A ball sits at the top of the screen above a glass of water on the bottom of the screen. When the ball drops you press the number five and the ball stops. You are given your time as well as a judgement that includes sober as a judge, call a taxi or call an undertaker.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Roy Poole", "publishers": "CCS", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/146671-rainy-day\n"}
