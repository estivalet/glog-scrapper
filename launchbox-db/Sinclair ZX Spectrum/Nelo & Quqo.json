{"altername_name": ["Nelo & Quqo and the Last Butifarreisson", "Nelo & Quqo y la Ultima Butifarra"], "name": "Nelo & Quqo", "overview": "Nelo and quqo are two delinquents who sleep in disreputable and unhygienic places. One day Nelo woke with an appalling hangover without his inseparable buddy Quqo. When he tried to leave the bar he realized he couldn't - the night before he'd buggered up the telly to vex the boring old farts. El Pira, owner of the bar, wanted the damage to be put right first. So Nelo went down to the cellar to find the tool that could help him put the TV right. El pira told him that quqo was intent on robbing the bank which they had been planning the night before, '..son of bitch' Clearly the problem is to free quqo while the streets swarm with the ol' bill. We'll have to see how you fix and use the things that you find laying about. Will you help him in his mission?", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "2010", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "retroworks", "publishers": "Retroworks", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/150699-nelo-quqo\n"}
