{"altername_name": ["Wulfan the Barbarian"], "name": "Wolfan", "overview": "Only Wolfan the Barbarian can put things right in a land overflowing with evil and violence, by killing an enemy known as The Nasty One. As Wolfan, you must travel through this isometrically-viewed world to find and kill The Nameless One, restoring the peace of King Richard's reign. Fairlight is an obvious inspiration here, with the screens displayed in a variety of monochrome combinations. There are lots of objects to pick up and trade with other monsters, although many monsters are more keen to kill. Magic frogs allow you to slay wizards for a limited period, donkeys can be ridden to allow faster travel, and Soothsayers can reveal knowledge.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Bulldog Software", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/104113-wolfan\n"}
