{"altername_name": [], "name": "Poker Dice Simulator", "overview": "INTRODUCTION: This game was designed as a simple experiment in artificial intelligence; the computer would roll five dice, then decide whether or not it was necessary to continue, and if so, which dice it should keep and which to re-roll. HOW TO PLAY: The aim is to win all of your opponent's money by betting on a series of poker dice. After rolling the dice, select the ones you want to keep by pressing the corresponding number beneath the dice - selections are highlighted, and can be toggled in case you change your mind - then press Enter to roll the remaining dice.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Stephen Corry", "publishers": "Frozen Ice", "genres": "Casino", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/169157-poker-dice-simulator\n"}
