{"altername_name": ["ZOOM: Nomen Ludi"], "name": "Zzoom", "overview": "The object of the game is to protect a series of refugees from enemy aircraft, tanks and submarines. The player's view consists of a crosshairs upon a simple ground and sky horizon, with an altimeter, a shield indicator and a radar. Refugees walk along the horizon, and the player must fire his guns and missiles at enemy units to prevent them from killing the refugees. Score is gained by destroying enemy units, and for refugees crossing the screen safely. However, due to a bug in the score calculation for refugees, should the player not allow any (or very few) refugees to survive a stage he will be rewarded with a bonus far in excess of what would be scored had the refugees been saved To achieve this the player invariably has to shoot the refugees himself \u2013 which although not the point of the game can be just as challenging, as while doing this the enemy will still be launching missiles and shooting at the player.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Imagine Software", "publishers": "Imagine Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.21", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zzoom", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogbZ6k9yzl8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/29734-zzoom\n"}
