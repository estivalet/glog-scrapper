{"altername_name": [], "name": "Blade Warrior", "overview": "History says that in 1479, the evil Squire Helfyre's vicous dominance of the village of loxton came abruptly to an end. The townsfolk had had enough - over the preceding 40 years, Helfyre had cause many dark things to happen. Late one winters night, the populace marched on Helfyre's castle, dragging Him from his bed, swiftly decapitating him then burning the mutilated and lifeless corpse. How were the simple townsfolk to know that he would live on? Helfyre's faithful manservant recovered most of the charred remains and laid them in a secret tomb, from where Helfyre would carry on his black arts in the guise of a hideous and all powerful DEATH DEMON . . . Now, on the eve of the 200th anniversary of that terrible night, you the BLADE WARRIOR must reunite Helfyre's missing skill with the rest of his remains to finally lay the Demon to rest. The townsfolk will at last be released from their seemingly endless nightmare. Go now, BLADE WARRIOR, for it is ten minutes to the witching hour - you must complete your mission before the church clock strikes the hour and an unholy orgy of violence and destruction is released . . .", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Antony M.
