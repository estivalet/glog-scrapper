{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mighty Magus", "overview": "you have to get a wizard down through around thirty levels of dungeon, kill the dragon and back to the top again. There where an increasing number of monsters to fight on the way down and chests/rubbish piles to search for spellpower, life energy and magic items. Traps in the floor did various nasty things and have to be watched for carefully. The dungeon was automatically generated each time the game was played, only to top and bottom layers stayed the same. The number keys cast the spells (higher the number, more powerful the spell), and that spells make walls temporarily passable.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Neil D.
