{"altername_name": [], "name": "Painter", "overview": "Painter is a variation of the classic Make Trax originally created for the arcades. The main principle in both is basically the same: to paint the entire layout to advance to the next stage. The scenario is constituted by a single room composed by a grid of big paint pots. \"Patrick the Painter\", the character the player will play with, has to successfully surround each one of them by painting their adjacent layout with his aerosol spraying. When this happens the colour in the background of the pots changes from yellow to blue. Patrick's aerosol has only a limited supply of paint. He has to properly manage and economize its use while choosing which one is the better path to walk and therefore to paint. Ink rollers are the only threat present on the screen and a collision with one of these instantly knock-outs Patrick and causes him to loose one of his aerosols. If all the ink in the aerosol is sprayed before the entire layout of a scenario is painted, the game is immediately lost. The number of ink rollers present in each scenario increases when a level is completed. The maximum number of ink rollers present at the same time on a scenario is 4.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "A'n'F Software", "publishers": "A'n'F Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/117751-painter\n"}
