{"altername_name": ["Lala the Magical"], "name": "Lala Prologue", "overview": "Lala wanted to be a witch by all means, so she entered the Great Witch Academy, led by Mistress Morgana la Marrana, who admited her \u2019cause she didn\u2019t have any pupils because of the worldwide crisis. Morgana herself teached the very first basics of magic and sorcery to Lala, who was not a very good student. One day, Morgana ran out of chipped man bile, so she went to the supermarket to buy some and Lala had to stay on her own in the academy with all those machines and magic filters to her disposal. She began trying some spells, and as nothing happened, she just opened the windows so to freshen the air. But before she could be aware, all the pots with magical filters and chemicals flew off thru\u2019 the window scattering all around the surroundings.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "2010", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "The Mojon Twins", "publishers": "The Mojon Twins", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/150490-lala-prologue\n"}
