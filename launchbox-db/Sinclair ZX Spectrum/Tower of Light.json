{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tower of Light", "overview": "During the battles between good and evil, a particularly evil character decided to overthrow the Dark One and take up his role. Unfortunately for him, his efforts failed and he fled to an unsuspecting beautiful land. And so began the dark age: First of all he decided to call himself the Dark Lord, and to justify his title he plunged the land into eternal darkness. He then summoned all his evil followers to his empire, to be his servants. These servants wander throughout the land reporting back to their master anything out of the ordinary. The High Council, the followers of good, decided not to let this pass and that good should be restored back to the land. They decided that this was a task only a small company could perform. Four characters have been asked to carry out this task, each chosen for their special talents. A Wizard, A Human, An Elf, and a Dwarf. The choice is theirs to take this task or not.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Caris Software", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148643-tower-of-light\n"}
