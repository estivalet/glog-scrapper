{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Fall Guy", "overview": "Based on the television series of the same name, The Fall Guy has the player controlling a stuntman who is trying to film scenes for an upcoming movie. There are five scenes as follows: Scene 1: The player must make their way across railway cars, avoiding birds that throw rocks down at them, and jump across stove pipes. Scene 2: This scene has the player jumping over ore cars while avoiding a person throwing stones at you from the tracks. Scene 3: No one in sight. All the player needs to do here is jump from boat to boat without falling off. Scene 4: The player must jump from one tank to the next, avoiding the missiles that are aimed at them. Scene 5: Similar to Scene 2, but only this time, the player needs to jump from crate to crate, which are loaded into an \u201cElite\u201d truck. Getting the police hat awards points to them. If the player bumps into an obstacle or fall off whatever they are on, the player has to retake the shot. They have three takes per game. Also, as they roll the tape, the player uses up money and production costs, so the player cannot afford to make any mistakes. If the player manages to complete all five scenes, they move on to a more difficult level.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Elite Systems", "publishers": "Elite Systems", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.6", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78519-the-fall-guy\n"}
