{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bobby Bearing", "overview": "Bobby Bearing is an isometric 3D arcade adventure game released by The Edge in 1986 for the Sinclair Spectrum. Bobby and his family are ball bearings who live in Technofear, \"a land of the future made of steel, and inhabited by things of steel.\" Bobby's brothers have been led astray by their rogue cousin and are now lost in the Metaplanes outside their home - stunned and captured by the evil Bearings that inhabit the Planes. The player controls Bobby Bearing in his search for his four lost brothers and their cousin. He must avoid the evil Bearings, find his missing and unconscious relatives, and roll them out of the Metaplanes to safety. The mission must be accomplished before the time limit runs out, otherwise the game ends and Bobby's relatives are lost forever. A time penalty is incurred each time Bobby dies or is stunned. If Bobby is trapped and unable to leave a screen, pressing 'Q' will reset the screen at the cost of a time penalty. Air vents, Elevators, switches, crushers and evil Bearings can help or hinder Bobby in his quest.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Robert Figgins", "publishers": "The Edge", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.36", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Bearing", "video_link": "https://youtube.com/watch?v=zWG6utK3KCI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78805-bobby-bearing\n"}
