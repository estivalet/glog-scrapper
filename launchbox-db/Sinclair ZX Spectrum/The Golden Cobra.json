{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Golden Cobra", "overview": "You will be flown in to an old landing-strip that once served a gold mine which has long since been abandoned. The aircraft will return to collect you but can only wait a few days so you must be back at the airfield on time if you are to survive. You will travel through many locations in the valley and encounter various objects sine if which will be of no help and others will serve more than one purpose. You can examine these objects but can only carry so much at a time depending on the size and weight of the different items. It is hoped that you will find many hours of enjoyment in the finding and recovery of the idol and also the solving of difficulties along the way. Fame and fortune await you if you are successful! - GOOD LUCK!", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Brian Cavers", "publishers": "CCS", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyN91SpxfgQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148132-the-golden-cobra\n"}
