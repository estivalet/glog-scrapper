{"altername_name": ["Catterpillar"], "name": "Caterpillar", "overview": "The object of the game is to destroy the caterpillar as it weaves its ways through the mushroom field. There are many other creatures to help the caterpillar reach the players area and destroy you. When the player has been killed all the partly shot and poisoned mushrooms are rebuilt and the player receives one point for each. The creatures are removed and if the player has any bases left, then the caterpillar starts again at the top of the screen with all the shot segments rebuilt. The number of bases remaining are displayed at the top of the screen. If the player destroys all the segments, the game continues with another caterpillar entering the top of the screen. Each new wave will have half a caterpillar added up to a maximum of three caterpillars.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "CDS Microsystems", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/149629-caterpillar\n"}
