{"altername_name": [], "name": "BreakThru: The Arcade Game", "overview": "BreakThru is a 2D side-scrolling vehicle shooter. Your mission: race, jump, and blast your way through five levels (mountains, bridge, plains, city, and airfield) of enemy defenses to recapture the stolen jet fighter. A host of enemy soldiers, mines, vehicles, and aircraft will try to stop you, though. Oh yeah... and don't forget to watch out for those rocket attacks and falling rocks! BREAKTHRU Mountains: Encounter minefields and small groups of men who will attempt to delay and destroy your invading jeep. Landslides and rockfalls are to be avoided whilst lurking in the tunnel between two mountains are flamethrower tanks. BREAKTHRU Bridge: Defenders on the bridge, reinforced by missile firing armoured fighting vehicles, will try to prevent crossing. The bridge has been blown up and must be jumped in various locations. BREAKTHRU Prairie: Cross the prairie where the defences are more difficult and ultimately a water obstacle bars the plane. BREAKTHRU City: Encounter enemy hardware and if you survive the onslaught you finally BREAKTHRU to the plane. BREAKTHRU Airfield: Run to the plane avoiding flamethrowers and everything thrown at you that the enemy can muster.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Arc Developments", "publishers": "U.S. Gold", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.79", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BreakThru_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7j8LPk6tYw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/55660-breakthru-the-arcade-game\n"}
