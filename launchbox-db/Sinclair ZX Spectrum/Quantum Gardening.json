{"altername_name": [], "name": "Quantum Gardening", "overview": "The pig breeding season is once more at an end and Eadwig Addlethorpe has turned to his other passion at this time of year: growing tulips. Eadwig's garden is not like any you will have seen before, for he is relentlessly pursued around the trellises he erects by last year's crop of borlotti beans, and there are deadly giant bees roaming the area too. Thankfully Eadwig has devised an innovative method of dealing with these problems: quantum gardening. For any event at which there could be more than one possible outcome the universe splits into two or more alternate realities. In one universe team A might win the Interstellar croquet tournament, in the other it will be won by team B. Sometimes we even make a choice as to which of these alternate realities we should enter - should we take that new job as a yodelling dumpling arranger or stay in our present situation as a blancmange flinging trebuchet operator? Other events such as the weather seem random and out of our control. Eadwig, however, has dicovered that he has the ultimate power to decide which future alternate reality he enters - decisions which would not, on the face of it, be his to make. He may have a choice between a future where snails attack his plant, or one where it rains all day and the snails decide to go snorkelling instead. In order to ensure the best results Eadwig simply chooses to enter the version of the future where his plants thrive. It's free, completely organic, and no pygmies are harmed in the process.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/125307-quantum-gardening\n"}
