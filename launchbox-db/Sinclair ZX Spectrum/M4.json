{"altername_name": [], "name": "M4", "overview": "M4 is a simple Frogger clone developed entirely in BASIC. It was designed by Peter Shaw and published as a type-in game by Virgin Books in the book Games for Your ZX Spectrum in 1983. Instead of a traditional frog you play a little stick man. You start on the blue line on the bottom and your goal is to reach an identical blue line on the top. Also instead of crossing crocodiles and turtles in water once you reach the middle line, you just have to cross another line of cars.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Peter Shaw", "publishers": "Virgin Books", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/entry/15169/ZX-Spectrum/M4", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/140877-m4\n"}
