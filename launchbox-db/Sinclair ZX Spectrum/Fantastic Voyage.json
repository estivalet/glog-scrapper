{"altername_name": ["Blood 'n' Guts"], "name": "Fantastic Voyage", "overview": "At the end of the same year Quicksilva marketed a curious experiment by programmer John R. Edmonds that combines knowledge of the human body with the characteristics of an arcade exploration game. They advertised it under the name of \u201cBlood 'N' Guts\u201d from October 1984, they thought it would be a good idea for it to be endorsed by 20th Century Fox due to the similarity of part of the game's argument with that of the 1966 film \"Fantastic Voyage\", directed by Richard Fleischer and starring Stephen Boyd, Donald Pleasance and Raquel Welch, among others. They asked Edmonds to tweak both the storyline of their game and its graphics, for which he would need some help, as they tried to get the rights to buy from the film producer to publish the game under the name of the film. Once in 1985, a promotional campaign for the video game based on the film was developed and the specialized press took care of the rest. Hardly anyone mentioned the previous version and focused on the strengths and weaknesses of Quicksilva's \u201cFantastic Voyage\u201d. \"Blood 'N' Guts\" was soon replaced by the new version, already with the new title, as we have known it since then. Magazines waited for the new licensed version, before writing anything about the game, prior notice from the company. Today a copy of \"Blood 'N' Guts\", given the few quantities published, is considered collectible and highly sought after, and therefore at a high cost.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "QuickSilva", "publishers": "Quicksilva", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/145960-fantastic-voyage\n"}
