{"altername_name": ["3D Fighter"], "name": "3D Starstrike", "overview": "Based on the extremely successful Star Wars arcade cabinet, 3D Starstrike was pretty accurate for what was a very complex game at the time. Unlike many of the other 3D games being released at the time, accuracy and strategy were jettisoned in favour of old fashioned, blasting fun. Still plays a good game now and stands up well against the official Star Wars release on the CPC despite being released almost three years before it!", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Andrew Onions", "publishers": "Bumfun Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.30", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8lj99W7o84", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/29739-3d-starstrike\n"}
