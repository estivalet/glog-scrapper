{"altername_name": [], "name": "Coloristic", "overview": "It is the conversion of a mobile game called Coloristic 2 and developed by Daniel Krautwurst. The goal is to move a pointer across a checkered board, trying to paint a set number of squares. We cannot retrace our steps or go through already painted squares, so the difficulty lies in finding the necessary moves to complete the squares without getting caught. Things get complicated later, as more complex colors and boards are added. The conversion for ZX Spectrum is very successful, with a very elegant design, quite catchy 128k music and other details such as codes to continue the game from one of the 80 levels it incorporates.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "2020", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Daniel Krautwurst", "publishers": "Daniel Krautwurst", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/144749-coloristic\n"}
