{"altername_name": [], "name": "Robot Rumpus", "overview": "Help 'Rory Robot' stop the terrorist robots from gaining total control of the Robo-Complex. To do this, you need to collect the Power Gems from each room and escape through the door that will appear at the bottom of the screen. The fact that the Power Gems are in a different position in each room (the positions change again each time you play) makes life very difficult. If you manage to reach room 15, the terrorists get really angry and life becomes even more dangerous!", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Simon P.
