And now, this is humans' last attempt to avoid our own extinction. Planet ZMX-22 could still save us. Known as \"Exo-tical\", due to its exoplanet status and its particular and dangerous natural characteristics, it contains an inexhaustible source of energy belonging to an ancient extinct civilization. Many expeditions have tried it before, but today, the last spaceships will leave for Exo-tical and it will certainly be our last chance.
