{"altername_name": ["Zip-Zap"], "name": "Zip Zap", "overview": "The object of the game is to survive through as many sectors (levels) of the planet \"Hallucinor\" as possible. You must steer the runaway robot through the fuel cells to pick them up. After passing through one it automatically moves to its position around the Tele-Port so that it can provide power to activate the Tele-Portal. The Tele-Portal must be fully energized with all four fuel cells in position around the Tele-Portal so that you can be transported to the next sector. To be transported you simply steer the robot through the centre of the fully energized Tele-Portal. The Tele-Portal will automatically come down and transport you to the next sector. Use your laser blaster to defend yourself against the attacking aliens. The brakes can be used to reduce your speed by about one third enabling you to turn in a smaller circle to avoid the aliens. As you travel through more and more sectors of the planet, the aliens become more and more vicious and intelligent... so beware...", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ian Weatherburn", "publishers": "Imagine Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.33", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_Zap", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPI5RmpLN6c", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/29732-zip-zap\n"}
