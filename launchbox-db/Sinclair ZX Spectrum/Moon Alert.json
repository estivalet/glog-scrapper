The aliens drop bombs at you, which must be dodged.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ocean Software", "publishers": "Ocean Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70k20LB24ck", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78118-moon-alert\n"}
