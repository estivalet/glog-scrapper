{"altername_name": [], "name": "Championship Baseball", "overview": "In this traditional baseball simulation, gameplay takes place mainly on a split screen.One side shows an overview of the field, the other showing the batter, with the latter view disappearing when the ball is hit. The game requires you to \"draft\" a team before play, composing the best possible squad based on each player's skill attributes. The game also allows a semblance of managerial control, and has an optional batting practice mode to warm up. It then allows you to play individual games, or participate in a 4 division, 24-team championship.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "GameStar", "publishers": "Activision", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "0.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Championship_Baseball", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/AUTRLW5VcXE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147500-championship-baseball\n"}
