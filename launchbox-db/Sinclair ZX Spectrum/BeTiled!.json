In his laboratory, he has developed a technology to stabilize the crystals, and to store the energy as it is released, and all with the aim of becoming the Master of the Universe. In this endeavor, he has the help of his faithful but inept servant, LoppoNoroccidental, who has been entrusted with the task of supplying stabilizing elements to the mixture. But the mad scientist has found several pitfalls that he did not have: Although the technique is highly perfected, the crystals become unstable in contact with oxygen: The manipulation must be extremely fast, to avoid that they end up exploding and destroying the laboratory. And, on the other hand, the higher the purity of the essential crystal, the more number of bonds between them is necessary, or the required energy is not obtained. The initial success of their studies has attracted the attention of the galaxy X-32, from where they will not hesitate to send their best agent to hinder the evil plans of the evil Cyril.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "2007", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Computer Emuzone", "publishers": "Computer Emuzone", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/144448-betiled\n"}
