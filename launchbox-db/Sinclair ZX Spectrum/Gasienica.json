{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gasienica", "overview": "Gasienica (Caterpillar) is an action game based on the \"Snake\" concept. The player controls a multi-segmented caterpillar, moving it around a playing field with food and rocks strewn about. Colliding with a rock, the level boundaries, or oneself makes the caterpillar lose a life; consuming a piece of food gives score and lengthens the caterpillar. Eating all the food allows the caterpillar to go to the next level.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "", "developers": "Marek Sosnowski", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147943-gasienica\n"}
