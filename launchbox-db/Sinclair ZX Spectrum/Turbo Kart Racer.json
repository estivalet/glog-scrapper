{"altername_name": [], "name": "Turbo Kart Racer", "overview": "Grab a Go-Kart and race it against three other racers to become champion over four tracks. To progress to the next track, the player must win each race. As well as normal acceleration, the Go-Kart is also fitted with a turbo which is limited so use it sparingly. Other things to keep an eye on is fuel levels, damage, engine, and tires. Scattered on the tracks are icons which can help keep the kart on the road. These include fuel, tires, spanners, fuel, and extra traction for steering. Turbo Kart Racer is a racing game viewed from above at a elevated angle where the screen shows a small part of the track. As well as the main playing area to see gauges. The keyboard and joystick can be used to steer the kart as well as accelerate, brake, and use the turbo.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Chris Elliott", "publishers": "Players Software", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.38", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/124009-turbo-kart-racer\n"}
