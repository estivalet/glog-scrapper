{"altername_name": [], "name": "WEC Le Mans", "overview": "WEC Le Mans is a racing simulation arcade game released in 1986 by Konami. It was the first racing video game to depict the 24 Hours of Le Mans. The Lap of Le Mans is split up into three sections, during which the time of day changes from day to dusk, dusk to night, and night to dawn. The game attempted to realistically simulate car driving, with the car jumping up and down, turning back and forth, and spinning up to 180 degrees, with an emphasis on acceleration, braking, and gear shifting, along with the need for counter-steering to avoid spin-outs. It also featured accurately simulated courses approved by the Automobile Club de l'Ouest, and used force feedback to simulate road vibration in the form of a vibrating steering wheel that reacts to the driver's acceleration and off-road bumps. The game is known as being very difficult to complete, the tracks width remains constant at 3 lanes of racing, and any slight contact with an opposing race car will result in either a spin, or a spectacular flip in the air. Going off the course and running wide at a corner will also end in a spin.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sentient Software", "publishers": "Imagine", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78700-wec-le-mans\n"}
