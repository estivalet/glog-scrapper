{"altername_name": ["Scalextric"], "name": "Scalextric: The Computer Edition", "overview": "Scalextric is a one or two player racing game based on the popular Hornby slot care racing system. The game is a simple two car, split screen racing game. Cars cannot come off the track but they do lose speed when driving along the track edge or when skidding in the chicanes. Cars can crash, a crash is when one car hits another from behind at a speed that's in excess of 20 mph. In a crash such as this the car that's behind automatically loses the race. However if the cars are level the race does allow one driver to move sideways to push the other player out of the way, either to make passing easier or to distract the other player. Each race can be for one or two players and when racing against the computer the player an select one of three difficulty levels to play against. Races can be from 1 to 99 laps long and the player has a choice of racing on one of the 2 supplied circuits or they can design their own.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Leisure Genius", "publishers": "Leisure Genius", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78014-scalextric-the-computer-edition\n"}
