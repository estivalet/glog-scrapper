{"altername_name": ["Turbo Cup"], "name": "Turbo Cup Challenge", "overview": "Based on sportscar and Paris-Dakar racer Ren\u00e9 Metge and his Porsche 944 Turbo, Turbo Cup is a racing game viewed from above and behind the car, in a forced perspective. Instead of the sand of the Dakar race, the game features four conventional French racetracks - Paul Ricard, Nogaro, Magny-Cours and Dijon-Prenois. After completing a qualifying lap you race against 21 similar cars. Contact with cars from behind causes you to spin but does not affect your rival, although side-on contact is usually beneficial. There are hazards off the track to avoid, and hitting the grass at speed causes a spin.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Loriciels", "publishers": "Loriciels", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5rvOi1c10c", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113431-turbo-cup-challenge\n"}
