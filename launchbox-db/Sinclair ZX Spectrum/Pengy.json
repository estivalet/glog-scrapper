{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pengy", "overview": "PENGY is controlled by an AGF or KEMPSTON joystick or by A-UP Z-DOWN M-RIGHT N-LEFT 1-PAUSE 2-RESTART The remaining keys on the bottom row make PENGY push an adjacent ice block. The maze contains normal blue blocks, bonus purple blocks and flashing yellow blocks which are frozen Snobees. When PENGY pushes an ice block it will either slide or melt. PENGY must destroy the Snobees either by crushing them with ice blocks, or when they are green and dizzy, by running over them. If the Snobees trap PENGY by a wall, pushing the wall will cause temporary dizziness in the nearby Snobees. The Snobees are courageous when in a swarm, but cowardly on their own, and the last bee has the tendency to fly away before PENGY can kill him. Bonuses are won by pushing the three bonus blocks together in a line, crushing two or more bees with one block, and by clearing each maze quickly. Each maze cleared brings more faster and deadly Sno-bees.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dominic Wood", "publishers": "Micromania", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/zFJKXbbKnhY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148416-pengy\n"}
