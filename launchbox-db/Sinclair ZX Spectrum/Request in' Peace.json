{"altername_name": [], "name": "Request in' Peace", "overview": "Help our hero stay alive until day break, by appeasing the Lost Souls with gifts and other demanded objects. As each grave opens, the souls within make their requests known. Fetch and deliver the requested objects and the grave will seal. Wait too long and the grave may release one of its many unhappy denizens to taunt you. Successfully complete all the errands to move up through the levels and get one step closer to the gates that exit the cemetery... Fail, and you risk being doomed to stay, forever running errands for all eternity, in a closed loop of inescapable time... Join the damned, or serve them - that is your choice... Around the grave yard are scattered all the objects demanded, but collecting them may prove a challenge. Our hero can only carry one object at a time. Some objects require the use of other objects before the can be collected (eg: The Magic Wand opens sealed doors), and some objects come in parts (eg: Relic Coins). On every level, you should avoid the many wandering denziens, whose contact will impede our heroes\ufffd errand quest. The consequences of denizen contact varies, from the harmless stealing of objects, to the poisoning of blood that leaves your hero stunned, blinded, or wandering and confused. All contact is generally discouraged, except in two instances: In the first, if a player waits long enough, a demon is summoned. As demons crave power more than anything else, the gift of the Magic wand will earn your hero more respect - but only if you can reach him before he leaves the grave yard altogether... In the second, the Damned may release an ectoplasmic electro-static discharge that may agitate the normally peaceful graves around you. Ground this willo-the-wisp quickly and you might save yourself some hassle... Serve them and you'll live, Serve them well, and you may gain much much more... Now how can one resist a deal with the Devil like that, huh?", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "2013", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Climacus", "publishers": "Climacus", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151142-request-in-peace\n"}
