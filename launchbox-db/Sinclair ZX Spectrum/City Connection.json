{"altername_name": [], "name": "City Connection", "overview": "It is an adaptation of the arcade City Connection (Jaleco, 1985), which never had an official version for the system... Back in 1986 or 1987, I was learning Assembler with the Machine Code course published by Microhobby. So I started to make a basic car game, with a horizontal scroll done in machine code. [\u2026] The game was left unfinished, and it was left there lost on tape. I then ditched the Spectrum, and didn't re-engage again until two or three years ago. After all this time, I no longer remembered this program that I left unfinished. About eleven months ago, rescuing old tapes I found one with several versions of a program called \"car\". It is currently finished and includes many of the characteristics of the original.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Manuel Lemos", "publishers": "Manuel Lemos", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/144715-city-connection\n"}
