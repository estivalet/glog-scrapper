{"altername_name": [], "name": "Magnets", "overview": "The main aim of Magnets is to give the user an understanding of the polarity of magnets (i.e. that they have North and South poles) and their behaviour (i.e. that like poles repel and unlike poles attract). The program also demonstrates that the power of attraction and repulsion depends on the strength of the magnet. It is important to realise that the behaviour of real magnets is very complex. In order to make the model simpler Magnets is played on a draughtboard, giving the magnets freedom to attract or repel in 2 dimensions only. In playing the game, the user has to consider the basic principles of magnetic behaviour, and plan a strategy according to the position and the strength of each of the magnets on the board.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Five Ways Software", "publishers": "Macmillan Software", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148317-magnets\n"}
