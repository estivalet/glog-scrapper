{"altername_name": [], "name": "European 5-A-Side", "overview": "Five a side football is played indoors, in a walled arena which causes the ball to rebound at an angle when fired against it. This game gives you the chance to play this, either against a friend or the computer. The action is viewed top-down, with a slight angle giving a 3D effect, which is especially noticeable when the ball is in the air. You control the player nearest to the ball, including the goalkeeper once the ball reaches the 6-yard area, and can pass or shoot from any distance. The length of the match can be altered, as can the colour of the pitch.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Silverbird Software", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/105901-european-5-a-side\n"}
