{"altername_name": [], "name": "Zombie Zombie", "overview": "Zombie Zombie, the followup to Ant Attack is an action game that inherits the three freedom grades and isometric perspective from its predecessor. The freely explorable city is filled with zombies that threaten all human life. The player controls either a boy or a girl and the objective is to kill the zombies by luring them off the high points of the city. The player can jump down unlimited levels, but only up one. In order to create structures that allow the player to scale them, you have a helicopter at your disposal that can be used to move blocks around. Zombies are made to follow you by creeping up on them and touching them on the back. They can then be led to their doom by leading them over a wall of at least 3 blocks in height. Zombies can also be pushed away by using your blaster The perspective can be switched between four 90\u00b0 turned views and when all of three lives are lost, it's Game Over.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Spaceman", "publishers": "Quicksilva", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.43", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie_Zombie", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Xc5isZsKOM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/104063-zombie-zombie\n"}
