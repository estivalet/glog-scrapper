{"altername_name": [], "name": "Space Junk", "overview": "A strange signal has crossed the Solar System, damaging the mining bases that the human being has dispersed through space. All the robots and auxiliary machines have gone crazy and any object that approaches them will be considered as objective to eliminate. Your mission will be to destroy the six generators that power these machines at each base avoiding that they can overheat, explode and produce a chain reaction that could eliminate the Earth. Once finished your mission you will be able to return home. The enemies are indestructible except the cyan ones, if you shoot them three times they will be paralyzed for a short period of time. You must familiarize with the movement of your ship as it turns on its axis, so think your movements to face the generators or before entering the corridors. You can use wider spaces for change your direction.
