{"altername_name": ["Five in a Row"], "name": "5 in a Row", "overview": "A thought provoking strategy game for 1-3 players. Careful planning on where to place your marker will stop your opponents - or the computer - making a row before you. For added interest why not change the level of difficulty, or use co-ordinates to tell the computer where you want to move next. Whatever the age this game will provide many hours of competitive fun.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "K. G.
