{"altername_name": [], "name": "Alchemist", "overview": "The player controls a skilled alchemist, who has been summoned to defeat an evil warlock. The game takes place in the warlock's castle, with the objective of finding four pieces of a magic scroll. This will allow the alchemist to use the \"Spell of Destruction\" to defeat the warlock. The alchemist can transform into a golden eagle, requiring the use of spell energy. Transforming between the two is essential to completing the game: The alchemist can hurl lightning bolts and other spells, but the eagle form is required to negotiate steep hills or drops. The alchemist can only carry one item at a time and food needs to be found during the game to keep stamina levels up. Movement, bumping into objects, or transforming depletes stamina. Fighting monsters also reduces stamina although this can be mitigated by carrying an axe or sword.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ian Weatherburn", "publishers": "Imagine Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.08", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alchemist_(video_game)", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHPTUQJsAQQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/29675-alchemist\n"}
