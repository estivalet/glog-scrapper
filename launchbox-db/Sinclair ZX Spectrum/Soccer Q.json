{"altername_name": [], "name": "Soccer Q", "overview": "In order to succeed in making your team league and cup champions you must answer questions. You can't select your team but you can train them instead by answering questions. If you get the question correct then they improve, answer wrong and they get worse. To play a game against a team you have to answer questions as well. If they're attacking, get the question right and it's saved. Get it wrong and they score. Likewise if you are attacking, right means you score, wrong and it's saved. You start in Division 4 (League 2 here in 2012) and work your way up to Division 1 (Premiership). You also enter the F.A. Cup (still the same) and League Cup (Carling Cup). The game is just text, no graphics here. There are around 2000 questions in the database.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Cult Games", "genres": "Quiz", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/368363-soccer-q\n"}
