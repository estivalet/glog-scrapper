{"altername_name": [], "name": "Matching Pairs", "overview": "Matching Pairs is a game for one to two players where a 6 x 4 grid is full of pairs of squares with different colours and patterns hidden, and each player has to try to match the pairs by selecting two squares. If a player gets a matching pair then they have another go, but when a player gets a guess wrong then it is the next players turn. If playing a one player game then the idea is to match the pairs in the fewest amount of guesses. There are five levels to play but if one player or both players don't get all the matching pairs in a certain amount of turns then it is game over.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Sheila Hunt", "publishers": "CCS", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "0.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/146940-matching-pairs\n"}
