{"altername_name": [], "name": "Klax", "overview": "The concept is simple - catch the different coloured tiles as they advance towards you and flip each tile into one of five bins. The object is to make Klaxes: these are same coloured stacks or tiles, Horizontals, Diagonals and Rows of three. Once a Klax is made the tiles disappear, causing any tiles on top to drop down and replace them. For bonus points, set up the tiles to cause a chain reaction of Klaxes. Your paddle can hold a maximum of 5 tiles and once full, tiles will just drop past it. Similarly, each bin can hold 5 tiles, and when full you will not be able to flip any more tiles into it. The 'drop meter' in the centre of the screen shows how many tiles you failed to catch. Should you drop more tiles than you are allowed, or if all the bins become full at the same time, the game will end. A tile that flashes multiple colours is a 'wild' tile - capable of forming part of a number of Klaxes. For example, if you flipped a wild tile onto a stack of 2 blue tiles and it fell beside a horizontal line of 2 green tiles, both blue and green Klaxes would be made, and all 5 tiles would disappear. A speed up option is available which causes all the tiles on screen to hurtle towards you at high speed. Alternatively, use the Throw Option to flip a tile back up the screen in order to pick up a tile of another colour. Beware! You can only throw one tile at a time, and it will still come rolling back with all the other tiles as well! The game is played by completing Wave after Wave. Each Wave has its own set of criteria for you to meet such as surviving for a certain number of tiles, or getting a set number of diagonal Klaxes. You will be told about these at the beginning of each wave. Remember, the harder the Klax the more points you score. For example, diagonal Klaxes are worth more than vertical or horizontal ones.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Teque Software Development", "publishers": "Domark", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klax_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5G3d-TqXo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/55251-klax\n"}
