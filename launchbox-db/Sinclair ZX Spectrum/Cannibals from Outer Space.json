{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cannibals from Outer Space", "overview": "Dralon Sladdomnac Fast Food Emperor of Grebignurk is about to add a new item to his menu - the Earthlingburger. The ceaseless search for a Grebian Mudhogburger substitute for hungry space creatures has finally come to an end and a Planet Processor has been dispatched to Earth to collect the first shipment of Earthlings. You are fearless space hero Captain Birk and it's your job to save the Earth from being minced, flame grilled, and served in a sesame seed bun. You have beamed aboard the enemy ship with a squad of commandos who have landed in different places due to the difficulties involved in long range teleporting to moving targets. Members of the Cannibal League, a secret society of Earthmen, have joined the Garks in return for a legal supply of their favourite food. These men must be eliminated before they eliminate you. The ship has a self-destruct mechanism housed in a sealed bunker under heavy guard. This may only be activated by a key held by the emporer himself and cannot be deactivated. Ninety-nine seconds after activation the ship will be destroyed and you'll be a dead hero if you didn't find an escape shuttle.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "0.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/105027-cannibals-from-outer-space\n"}
