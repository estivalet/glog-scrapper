{"altername_name": [], "name": "FA Cup Football", "overview": "FA Cup Football is officially licensed by the English F.A, and lets you lead your English club side to the FA Cup victory. First you have to select your team and how many players will play the game (maximum is 8). You can select formation and between 3 different game strategies, which are: attacking, balanced and defensive. Sometimes you have to answer to some questions where you have 3 choices. For example, if your player wants to leave the club, what would you do? Like in the real F.A Cup, your opponent will be decided by a random draw. Before each match you will see your next opponent. In the game you'll see all the fixtures, and watch how the matches are going minute by minute. If your team wins, you continue to the next round (unless it was the final). Drawn matches result in replays; at this time infinite replays were used rather than penalty shoot outs. Random events such as player injuries or off-pitch problems often occur before replays.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kerian UK", "publishers": "Mastertronic", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "8", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/123051-fa-cup-football\n"}
