Quite possibly the best and most elaborate hoax in the history of the Spectrum, performed by the editors of Your Sinclair. \"'The most advanced domestic chore simulation yet to hit the home micro,' claims the advertising blurb. 'Awe inspiringly realistic with a near infinite number of randomly generation rural and suburban lawn scenarios.' Hollow advertising rhetoric? So much insincere profit chasing hype?... Not on your grass-box, matey: this game is ACE!\" This was released as an April Fool's joke, and the name was probably taking a potshot at Codemasters for their overuse of the word \"simulator\" in the titles of their games.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "April 1, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gardensoft", "publishers": "Your Sinclair", "genres": "Vehicle Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.6", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/90891-advanced-lawnmower-simulator\n"}
