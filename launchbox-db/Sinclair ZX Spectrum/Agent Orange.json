{"altername_name": [], "name": "Agent Orange", "overview": "Agent Orange is a horizontally scrolling top down view shoot-em-up. Eight planets have been infected by a strange weed planted by an alien life form. The weed is sucking the life out of the planet and needs to be destroyed. You control a ship with Agent Orange on board which when planted will kill the weed. When you land on a planet you can see the killer weed growing. Alien fighters try and stop you sowing Agent Orange. Any fighter destroyed leave behind a seed. Collect the seeds but be careful as carrying too many seeds cause your ship to crash. You can move the screen left and right. The joystick steers the ship while the fire button shoots your weapons. Holding down the fire button releases the Agent Orange.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "A&F Software", "publishers": "A&F Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.27", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_Orange_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh03bk-2N9M", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/46175-agent-orange\n"}
