{"altername_name": [], "name": "Star Searcher", "overview": "Our friendly alien has engine trouble. These Mk111 lithosaucers were never the most reliable of craft. A couple of trips around the galaxy and you've got to replace the delithium star crystals. So we find ourselves a nice little planet full of delithium mine workings and the rest should be easy. As soon as our ship touches down we scramble out and dig our way towards the crystals, located inside the pummellers. But be quick, because the local inhabitants will be blasting their robotank cannon at your saucer in no time at all. Avoid the red rocks - they'll not only slow you down but crush you to a pulp if you try to go under them. Once you have the crystals zoom into the air chamber and - well, your problems are only half over. Now you have to get back to your ship on the surface, jumping from rock to rock collecting crystals on the way as quickly as you can. It's a tough life cruising the spaceways, but with practice you'll do it.
