{"altername_name": [], "name": "Street Gang Football", "overview": "A street-wise football simulator where the teams are rough and the rules don't apply. Two of the meanest gangs this side of the Bronx take to the streets of a downtown ghetto to kick and fight their way to the goal. All the features of Street Football plus all the features of a mean beat-em-up - and more! The field of action is a fully detailed downtown street - cars, buildings, pavements, wasteground, potholes and walls all have to be negotiated before you can get near the goal. The teams foul and fight each other to gain the advantage. They may even decide to play with a tin can if the ball bursts!", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Codemasters", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/370786-street-gang-football\n"}
