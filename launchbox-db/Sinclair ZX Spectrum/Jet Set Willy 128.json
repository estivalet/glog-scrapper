{"altername_name": ["Jet Set Willy 128K"], "name": "Jet Set Willy 128", "overview": "Not the 128th installment of the fan made Jet Set Willy hacks (although it might be...), the 128 in this case is for 128k. The extra ram space utilizes a better soundtrack and some more rooms but is a more faithful rendition of the original Matthew Smith games than a number of the hacks out there. Like the original sequel, this is a platform game where all the rooms can be freely traversed from the start. Each room has its own hazards, such as spikes, guardians (ranging from demonic heads to giant penknives), and ropes which can be climbed and grasped in mid-air. Touching a monster or a stationary hazard, or falling a great distance, causes instant loss of a life and places Willy back at the room entrance. The route through the house must be navigated carefully, due to the multiple entrances to some rooms - this is perhaps the first action game where mapping is an advantage.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "John Elliott", "publishers": "", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i5A5SOvq1w", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165216-jet-set-willy-128\n"}
