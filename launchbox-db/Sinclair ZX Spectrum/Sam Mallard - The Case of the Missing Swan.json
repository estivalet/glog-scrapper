{"altername_name": ["Sam Mallard: El Caso del Cisne Desaparecido"], "name": "Sam Mallard: The Case of the Missing Swan", "overview": "The clock had turned midnight and I was just about to leave my office when there was a knock on my door. It was a Mr. Swan, owner of the Swanline shipping company, he explained that his wife was missing and the police had told him that \"Unless they can prove outright that there was an involuntary disappearance, they just file paperwork.\" He said he'd pay me a grand upfront if I could find his wife by morning, no question asked. That may be a suspiciously large reward for a simple missing person case, but I haven't had that many jobs lately and my purse is getting thin, so who am I to ask questions?", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "2016", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ersh", "publishers": "", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/126640-sam-mallard-the-case-of-the-missing-swan\n"}
