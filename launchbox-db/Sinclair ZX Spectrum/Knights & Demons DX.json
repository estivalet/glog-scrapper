{"altername_name": [], "name": "Knights & Demons DX", "overview": "The war between Light and Darkness has begun! Each battle must be fought until either the last knight or demon perishes on the battlefield... In other words, your mission is to fill the complete board with knights or demons only (depending on the side you choose) before time runs out. Whenever you fire a spell over a certain position, its occupant is transformed from demon to knight or vice-versa. However eachblast causes a limited chain reaction, inducing a similar transformation at the neighbor positions immediately above, below, left and right, in the shape of a cross. Alternatively you may throw a pike that only transformsthe occupant of the target position, without affecting its neighbors. However the pikesupply is limited... so use them wisely! Additional pikes can be obtained as reward for completing challenges the gods may offer you occasionally. At this time, if the requested sacrifice is too high, you may exercise your free will and simply ignore it. The outcome of each battle affectsthe war balance, displayed at the bottom of the screen. War is over when the balance is completely shifted towards Good or Evil. The game has 3 different finales, depending on the side and difficulty you choose.Good luck...
