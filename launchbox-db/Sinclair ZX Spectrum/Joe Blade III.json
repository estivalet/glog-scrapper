{"altername_name": [], "name": "Joe Blade III", "overview": "Joe Blade is the title of a series of budget-price platform games written by Colin Swinbourne and published by Players. All three titles were flick-screen adventures, in which the player controls the title character through a number of rooms, dispatching enemies and rescuing innocent people. The manner of this varies between the three games. Joe Blade 3 returned to the first title's formula, arming Blade with a machine gun. Exclusively released for the ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC, it included Commodore 64 instructions in its inlay, but no Commodore 64 version was ever released.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Colin Swinbourne", "publishers": "Players Premier", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Blade", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/102956-joe-blade-iii\n"}
