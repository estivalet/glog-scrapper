{"altername_name": [], "name": "Football Manager 3", "overview": "Football Manager 3 is a managerial simulation in which the player is responsible for the athletic success of a soccer team in Great Britain. The game is controlled via menus which are reached by clicking on graphics in a visualized office. The focus lies on the athletic aspect, e.g. tactics, training (can be set separately for each athlete ) or lineup, the financial aspect is mostly restricted to buying and selling athletes on the transfer market. Of course each athlete has a number of statistics associated which influence his performance on the field. The matches are shown in one of two two non-scrolling perspectives, either top-down or slightly angled from the side, on which relatively small player icons do their work.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bedrock Software", "publishers": "Addictive Games", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_Manager_(1982_series)#Football_Manager_3", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/rM9a8BwD5qo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148068-football-manager-3\n"}
