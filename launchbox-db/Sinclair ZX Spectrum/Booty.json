{"altername_name": [], "name": "Booty", "overview": "The player takes on the role of a cabin boy who attempts to steal a horde of treasure from his pirate masters. A variety of hazards must be avoided including pirates, parrots and booby-trapped treasure. Should the player managed to collect all the treasure, he is given 45 seconds to find a final key, which will restart the game. There are a total of 20 screens in the game which contain a mixture of collectable treasure, doors to other screens, and doors which act as obstacles and can only be unlocked by collecting the appropriate numbered key. Some rooms contain non-player character pirates, contact with which will cause the loss of one of the player's three lives.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Firebird Software", "publishers": "Firebird Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.11", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booty_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCWXblEPVdA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/29684-booty\n"}
