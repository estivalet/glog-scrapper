{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Black Hole", "overview": "A single-screen shooter, this game puts the player in control of a small spaceship at the left hand side of the screen. A black hole pulses in the centre of the screen whilst alien spaceships stream relentlessly up and down, appearing and disappearing at the top and bottom of the screen. With two long range guns (the bullets from which are bent towards or away from the black hole) and a short range gun (whose bullets are unaffected by the black hole), the player has 6 lives to rack up as high a score as possible against the continuous alien hoard, lives being lost any time the player's ship isn't able to avoid the impact of an incoming alien spaceship.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Quest Microsoftware", "publishers": "Quest Microsoftware", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/98vOJyrsCQg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147444-the-black-hole\n"}
