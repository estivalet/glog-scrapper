There are the game options offered: play against the computer, against another player or two of them. When you choose one of these the computer deals the cards. They show the name of the territory you're in charge of and the kind of army you have in it. In this context, you must bear in mind that when it comes to a destroyer, five armies are assigned, if it's a reactor the armies are four, and if a tank, three. In every turn, the player can choose from attacking, placing armies or requesting information. When it decides to attack, it will appear on the left side of the screen the picture of the country that is being attacked, and at the right side, the attacker. Then throw the dice that will determine who is the victor, (bear in mind that you can throw as many dices as armies you dispose of in the territory.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Dinamic Software", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "3", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/2OiBElQw17A", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148322-mapsnatch\n"}
