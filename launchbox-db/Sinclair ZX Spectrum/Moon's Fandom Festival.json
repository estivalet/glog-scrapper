She has been invited to the Petunia Town Fandom Festival, a very 80's-90's retro festival where the stands are related with movies and tv series of those decades. Everything is ready for the first day! Moon is going to show her brand new game, indeed named \"Moon's Fandom Festival\". Everything is well until she goes to the locker where her beloved ZX Spectrum 48k and her new game are... but, oh! she has forgotten the digital password!!! Fortunately, the colleages of the other stands can help... but initially they are not very friendly. Moon will have to gain their respect if she wants to recover the password.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "August 7, 2019", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "iadvd", "publishers": "iadvd", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/150625-moons-fandom-festival\n"}
