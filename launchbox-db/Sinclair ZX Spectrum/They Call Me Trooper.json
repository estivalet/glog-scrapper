{"altername_name": [], "name": "They Call Me Trooper", "overview": "The year is 2108. The annual conference to discuss planetary peace is to take place on the planet Therop. The Theropi, intent on their secret plans to dominate the entire galactic system, have betrayed the members and placed each of them through their irreversible brain-drain machine, thus turning highly trained combatants into deadly exterminators. You, Major R.A. Trooper, Squad Captain for earth members, have managed to escape the brain-drain. It is your task to escape from the planet Therop and warn the galactic defence commission. The other luckless members, all intensively trained in unarmed combat, have been programmed to track you down and destroy you. There is only one priority in your mind above sentiment or compassion.
