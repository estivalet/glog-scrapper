{"altername_name": [], "name": "Firebirds", "overview": "Firebirds is based on the the arcade game Phoenix. Your goal is to repel an invasion of an alien species related to birds. You command an armed spaceship which you can manoeuvre with right and left directions. In each level you have to destroy an entire set of a specific type of monster bird which increasingly has more backup forces supporting it. The final showdown is to confront a grotesque aviary mother ship with a very devilish appearance. After the final enemy is destroyed, the game repeats itself with increased difficulty. Original aspects are mostly found on the technical side, as the game mixes a characteristic sound with some psychedelic graphics.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Graeme Devine", "publishers": "Softek", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.71", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/119467-firebirds\n"}
