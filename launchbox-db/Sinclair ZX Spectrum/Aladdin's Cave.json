{"altername_name": [], "name": "Aladdin's Cave", "overview": "Aladdins Cave is an arcade maze game published by Artic Computing. Just when you thought it was safe to go back into the Mansion, those awfully nice people at Artic have brought out another JSW clone. Actually Aladdin, Son of Willy isn't all that bad. There are some fairly fiendish rooms to get through and Artic has added stings to the tail. Firstly, you can change into a dolphin, genie or whatever, which makes collecting objects much easier. The old trick of picking up the easy pieces and coming back won't work on this one. If you leave a room before you've picked it clean, you lose all your other pieces.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "D.J.
