{"altername_name": ["100 KM"], "name": "100 Kilometri", "overview": "A weird idea around bike racing, using 'Trashman' graphics on the first and last part. The keys are: Q-speed up A-speed down P-change leader If you keep the speed around 30 and keep the P key pressed all the way thru the game, you reach the end with no problems.

I mean keyboard!", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Federico Fantazzini", "publishers": "Load'N'Run", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgM1BB_o9ZI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/150170-100-kilometri\n"}
