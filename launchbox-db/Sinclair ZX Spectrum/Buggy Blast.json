{"altername_name": [], "name": "Buggy Blast", "overview": "For over three centuries, the planet ENDRA has been inhabited by the LURGONS. The key to their power is held in the CENTRAL LURGON CORRIDOR (Sector 8). A pilot skilled enough to gain entry to this sector and destroy 20 Lurgons will cause a power reversal that will consume the whole complex. Because of the highly dangerous nature of this mission, a system of Cycredit Ratings is used to ensure, as closely as possible, that pilots do not attempt to make attacks in sectors beyond their capabilities. At each stage of the mission the Buggy will launch and locate the correct sector automatically - no pilot control is required. All systems are powered by an ARGON GAS CRYSTAL CONVERTER -mpilots must watch the Energy Counter and return to the Mother Ship in time to refuel. This involves avoiding or destroying the MINE JAMMERS, and delicate docking manoeuvres with the Mother Ship.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "David Lowe", "publishers": "Firebird Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/105025-buggy-blast\n"}
