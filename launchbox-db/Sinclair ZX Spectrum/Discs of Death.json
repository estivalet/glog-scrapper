{"altername_name": [], "name": "Discs of Death", "overview": "Discs of Death is an action game similar to the arcade game Discs of Tron. The game takes place in the 25th century where the player competes against an alien warrior in a competition to become the disc warrior champion. The game is played from a third person perspective and like in Tron the aim is to take out the opponent by throwing disks at him. Aiming is done with a laser sight that can be moved right and left. Upon hitting a wall the disc ricochets until it returns to the player. For defense reflector shields can be used to block discs but are limited in supply. Each player stands on platforms (there are two or three depending on level) and the characters automatically jumps between them when reaching the edges. Some levels have additional features such as force fields and homing discs.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ian Rich", "publishers": "Artic Computing", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/118567-discs-of-death\n"}
