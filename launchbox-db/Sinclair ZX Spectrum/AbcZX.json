{"altername_name": [], "name": "AbcZX", "overview": "Formerly, back in 1978 or so, there was a revolution in stationery, a kind of \"Perestroika kitsch\" that made it possible to find licorice gum \"Cosmos\", transparent and removable alarm clocks, glue of the demon \"Buh\", with its bag with colored pebbles to make mosaics, colored strawberries containing pica pica, bags of \"Peta-zetas\", psycho-warlike kalkitos, sweets of \"Snipe\" paste of mint or lemon-lime, (of almost the same color in its wrapping to encourage confusion when buying them). All these artifacts were but obvious signs of the arrival of the most sensational of them all ... Tacha\u00e1n !!! The yellow plastic tablet with the roji-white letters of the Spanish alphabet. It consisted of the game of 15 in alphabetical version. Recently I saw those tablets in a stationery of those that have a lot of bullshit from the year of the pear, like semicircles, the three maps of the peninsula in a plastic envelope, and other things like that ... I told myself that I could versionar that endearing game. Finally, the intention was to leave a game that evoke such nostalgia and at the same time make a bundle in the Bytemaniacos contest.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "2007", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Carlos Monroe Roig", "publishers": "Compiuter Soft", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.8", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEnKlUAbwKs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/57684-abczx\n"}
