{"altername_name": ["Cesta bojovn\u00edka"], "name": "Cesta bojovnika", "overview": "The player controls a young warrior who has to find 6 diamonds and then return to the beginning of his journey. However, the diamonds are locked in the bricks, so you have to find the key to each chest first. Along the way, he meets various enemies with whom he fights karate style. Among the enemies will appear, for example, a brejlovic, a ninja or a fighter with a stick. Enemy placement is random, so every game is different. After the player has brought the diamonds to the destination, the path to the castle opens, where he must obtain the amulet and then fight his way to freedom.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Karel Mal\u00fd", "publishers": "Ultrasoft", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cesta_bojovn%C3%ADka", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxt9NsqQAp0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165778-cesta-bojovnika\n"}
