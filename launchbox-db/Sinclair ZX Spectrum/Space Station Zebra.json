{"altername_name": [], "name": "Space Station Zebra", "overview": "There's only one thing worse than being lost in space... being found! Space Station Zebra is the furthest outpost of the galaxy, spinning silently in space until the aliens come... As it spins, the last survivor prepares for what could be the final onslaught. The energy reserves are low and all but one lazgun has been knocked out of action. And as he stares into space watching the stars and planets go by his radar screen flickers into life. On the dark side of the station something is stirring. He checks the rotation speed and slows the station down, the shield damage indicators show that seven more hits will finish the station. Energy levels are low but the lazgun light is still on and as the tell tale flash on the radar circles in, he manoeuvres the mighty base into position for the final conflict.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Pat W.
