{"altername_name": ["Bedlam Blaster"], "name": "Bedlam (AWA Software)", "overview": "Bedlam is a top down maze shoot 'em up. It is set on the planet Bovryll, where you are trapped in an asylum and must escape by shooting the alien guards down. Enemies follow pre-planned paths so can be picked off in a strategic manner, especially as the early waves don't fire at you. The controls involve pressing the directional key once to face a certain direction, and a second time to make the move.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Steve Hughes", "publishers": "AWA Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBQBVK8pZ98", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/117801-bedlam-awa-software\n"}
