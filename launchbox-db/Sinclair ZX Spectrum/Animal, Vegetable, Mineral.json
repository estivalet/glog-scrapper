{"altername_name": ["Animal Vegetable Mineral"], "name": "Animal, Vegetable, Mineral", "overview": "Animal Vegetable Mineral is a version of an 'after dinner' game in which players have to guess a mystery object by asking questions to which the answer is either Yes or No. In this game, the player thinks of an object and the game tries to guess it. The game comes with a very limited range of items, 'knowing' just two objects in each category. When the player submits an item the game does not have in its database, the player is asked how the new item differs from the best answer the game could give. This information is then stored, and so the game's repertoire grows. The game allows the player to review, edit, and store the database.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Arnold Wheaton Software", "publishers": "Arnold Wheaton Software", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/369523-animal-vegetable-mineral\n"}
