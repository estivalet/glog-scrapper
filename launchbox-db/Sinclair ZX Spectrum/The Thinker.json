{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Thinker", "overview": "The object of the game is to remove the large red block through the hole at the bottom of the puzzle. This is achieved by moving the blocks into spaces left by the movement of other blocks. On skill levels 2-5, if you take too long to make your move, the computer will move a block of it's choice. (This will always be against the best interest of the player.) The higher the skill level, the less time you have to make your move. If you make an illegal move, the computer will warn you. Do it too often and you are in for a nasty surprise.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ian Hook", "publishers": "Atlantis Software Ltd.", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/144474-the-thinker\n"}
