{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dinky Digger", "overview": "The object of the game is to clear the play area of all monsters and cherries. Unfortunately the monsters are trying to prevent Dinky from reaching this goal. To defend himself Dinky can try to avoid the monsters, but this is very often fruitless. However, all is not lost, for Dinky can throw his crystal ball at THEM. The ball travels in the direction he is running and kills the monsters on impact. The crystal ball may not always return immediately, so he must be sure that every throw counts. A second defense is to run beneath an apple allowing h to fall on a pursuing monster. But timing is critical and beware - Dinky may get flattened himself. The ultimate prize for Dinky is the lime cake at the center of the play area. Caution must be used in claiming the cake as it marks the entrance to the monsters' lair. After completing a play area, the following play area will be even faster and more challenging!", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ragrob", "publishers": "Postern", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "0.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4HQlfkE-EI&t=46s", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/118545-dinky-digger\n"}
