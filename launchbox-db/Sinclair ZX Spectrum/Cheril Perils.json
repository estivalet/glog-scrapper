{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cheril Perils", "overview": "Cheril, thanks to her strenght and intelligence, was able to say goodbye to her homeland, the jungle of Badajoz, travel accross the dusty paths full of monsters, and arrive to the big city. Nevertheless, she repented at once of her decision: the pharmaceutic enterprise \u201cParasol\u201d, founded in the 60s by a couple of aberrating mad doctors, had developed a special virus which could make people incredibly beautiful and they decided to make their tests on the poor city inhabitants. The problem wasn\u2019t the virus itself, which was awesomely well crafted and worked flawlessly, but the cistern truck which was used to transport it to the city: it was used to transport heavy morapio double-malt and wasn\u2019t properly cleaned after that. And, of course, everybody knows that beautifier virus plus morapio double malt makes infected people to become stupid brain-eating zombies. Cheril, completely unaware, arrived at the very same time the mayor of this town set up two enormous spiked boulders in the path which was used to enter and exit the city, after he had evacuated the very few \u201csane\u201d inhabitants. When she realised, she was trapped inside. She wanted to exit the city, but the mayor wouldn\u2019t remove the boulders while Zombies were still luring the city, so the only way for Cheril to escape from this doomed city is to slain the 60 zombies which walk around, so the mayor will remove the boulders and she can kiss this city goodbye!", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "2010", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "The Mojon Twins", "publishers": "The Mojon Twins", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/144653-cheril-perils\n"}
