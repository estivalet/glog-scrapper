{"altername_name": [], "name": "Chuckman", "overview": "Chuckman is a bomb disposal expert faced with a 60-screen maze with 8 bombs to neutralise. To do this, he must collect a toolkit, and can only carry one of these at a time. The paths to run along are yellow, and these also feature boots chasing you (these can be trapped in holes if you first collect a spade). There are also holes which can't be passed without a wheelbarrow to repair them, and regular earthquakes destroying parts of the paths. Each maze in generated randomly, and clearing all 8 bombs produces a new maze, with 3 skill levels influencing just how tough these are.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Add-On Electronics", "publishers": "Add-On Electronics", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/103127-chuckman\n"}
