{"altername_name": ["3D Starstrike II"], "name": "Starstrike II", "overview": "Having taken their 'inspiration' for the original 3D Starstrike from the arcade cabinet 'Star Wars' the natural assumption for the follow-up was that a facsimilie of 'The Empire Strikes Back' was on the cards... how wrong those assumptions were! Starstrike II built on the playability of the original but vastly improved the depth and variety of gameplay as well as improving on the graphics to create a sequel that truly excelled over it's already pretty good predecessor. Starstrike II was an innovative title that paved the way for Realtime's other 3D games that helped define a genre it has lost some of its shine following the later releases of the more accomplished Starglider but still plays a good game today.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Realtime Games Software", "publishers": "Realtime Games Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qrDU04TeCc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78188-starstrike-ii\n"}
