{"altername_name": [], "name": "Angler", "overview": "Angler is a fishing game where a river is viewed from the side. The player controls a boat left and right along the surface and has to catch the fish that swim back and forth in rows. With the press of a button the line will be cast and it will drop until the button is released, it hits a fish or reaches the river bed. To catch a fish the hook has to land exactly in front of it. In each game the player has 100 casts and has to catch as much fish as possible before they run out. In addition to fishes there are crabs which should be avoided since they eat fish that has been caught. To get rid of a crab it is necessary to catch one of the larger fish which in turn can eat the crab.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dirk Olivier", "publishers": "Virgin Games Ltd", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.43", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angler_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnt0cKU-ryY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/117862-angler\n"}
