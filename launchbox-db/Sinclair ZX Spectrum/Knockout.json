{"altername_name": [], "name": "Knockout", "overview": "Not all games have to contain Aliens, Lasers or spaceships, and we have produced this for people who just want simple but absorbing fun. Up to 4 players (turn based), or play against your Spectrum. The goal of the game is to your ball around the maze and into the sections formed by the green dividing lines. Ignoring the triangle shape, the first section scores 10 points, the second 20, then 40, 80, and 160. The yellow band is out of play, this scores no point.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mikro-Gen", "publishers": "Mikro-Gen", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFb-Ff0j0dk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/370019-knockout\n"}
