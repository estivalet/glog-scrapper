The player is the titular pakacuda fish and has to make his way through the maze and eat all the smaller fishes he comes across. The pakacuda is not only a predator but a prey too. He has to avoid the octopuses that chase him around the maze. If he comes into contact with an octopus he will lose one life. To protect himself the player has to eat eels that provides him with a charge enough to take on the octopuses. He is charged only during a limited time though and once it's over the defeated octopuses will reappear.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Rabbit Software", "publishers": "Rabbit Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "0.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXJsv0WHc0Q", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/110583-pakacuda\n"}
