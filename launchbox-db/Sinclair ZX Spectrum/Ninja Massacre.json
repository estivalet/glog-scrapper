{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ninja Massacre", "overview": "Ninja Massacre is a 1 or 2 player Gauntlet clone. As a ninja you must move around a maze collecting treasure, power-ups and killing all baddies. There are 50 levels to complete with a password after each one so you don't have to start at level one again. In 2 player mode both you and the other player play at the same time. The game is viewed from above but with the ninjas and baddies viewed from the side. A small part of the maze is shown at a time, scrolling as you move around. The joystick moves your ninja while the fire button throws your ninja stars. The keyboard can also be used.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "TAG Computer Games", "publishers": "Codemasters", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "1.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1DeALH3pQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/91823-ninja-massacre\n"}
