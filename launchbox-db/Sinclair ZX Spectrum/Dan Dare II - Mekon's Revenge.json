{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dan Dare II: Mekon's Revenge", "overview": "After more than a year's silence the Mekon stirs again from his hideout in deep space. His ambition to be ruler of Earth has not shaken in its resolve. The Mekon's last onslaught on the unsuspecting inhabitants of Earth was courageously foiled by Colonel Dan Dare and his chums. A giant atomic asteroid was propelled towards Earth; the Mekon's ransom was the precious freedom of the Earthlings or their total destruction! Dan boarded the asteroid and initiated its powerful self-destruct mechanism, escaping just in time to see the asteroid blast into thousands of harmless pieces! This time the Mekon has instigated immense scientific development and has produced a new, genetically engineered race... the SUPERTREENS! He has constructed a space ship to launch his dastardly creations on the Earth! The powers and abilities of the Supertreens would be many hundred times greater than normal Treens. The population of Earth would be killed or help captive within hours if the Mekon is successful in his launch of the Supertreens at just the right distance from Earth. Even before the Mekon jammed all of Earth's communication channels and issued his derisory message, Dan had assembled a full Space Fleet. There is only one way to defeat the Mekon - face to face!", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gang of Five", "publishers": "Virgin Games", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjLxUyHm7PM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/53563-dan-dare-ii-mekons-revenge\n"}
