{"altername_name": [], "name": "Granny's Garden", "overview": "An indelible memory for the entire '80s cohort of UK schoolchildren, this educational game, originally released in 1983 on the BBC Micro, solicits textual input from the player regarding the correct approach and technique for rescuing three pairs of royal children from a wicked witch. A variety of puzzle types with a wide and whimsical supporting cast kept classes of kids debating the correct course of action through an array of different environments, progress through each tracked courtesy of a password system. Some 15 or so years later, the game's developers eventually released a multimedia-enhanced remake of it for modern operating systems.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "4Mation Educational Resources", "publishers": "", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.3", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granny's_Garden", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/30711-grannys-garden\n"}
