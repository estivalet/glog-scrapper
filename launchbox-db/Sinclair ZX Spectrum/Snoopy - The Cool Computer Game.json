{"altername_name": ["Snoopy"], "name": "Snoopy: The Cool Computer Game", "overview": "Sally's little brother, Linus, has had his precious security blanket stolen, and is likely to be break down unless he gets it back soon. There are several suspects as to who could have stolen the moth-eaten rag, but there isn't enough evidence to convict someone of the beastly crime. Controlling Snoopy, you must take up the case, and wander around the many flick-screen locations, gathering objects and solving puzzles, until you can eventually locate and return the blanket to Linus - however, time is of the essence, and unless Linus gets his blanket within forty-five minutes, he will surely collapse of a broken heart. Your adventures will see you pottering all over the small town where the gang live, and the game features all of the gang members - Lucy, Sally, Peppermint Patty, and Marcie - in cameo roles.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "The Edge", "publishers": "The Edge", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/121818-snoopy-the-cool-computer-game\n"}
