{"altername_name": [], "name": "Chequered Flag", "overview": "Chequered Flag is a racing video game developed by Steve Kelly for Psion Software Ltd and published by Sinclair Research Ltd in 1983. It was the first driving game published for the ZX Spectrum and one of the first computer car simulators. Chequered Flag allows a player to select a racing track and one of three cars; two with manual gears and one automatic. Two of the cars are named Ferretti and McFaster, in reference to Ferrari and McLaren, who had come first and second in the 1982 Formula One season. Tracks available include Brands Hatch, Circuit de Monaco, \u00d6sterreichring, Autodromo Nazionale Monza, Circuit Paul Ricard, Silverstone Circuit and 4 fictitious circuits. The game is viewed in first-person perspective, from the driver's seat, with each car having a different dashboard layout. With no other cars to race, the aim is to complete laps in the best time possible, avoiding road hazards such as oil and broken glass. The player must also economise fuel and avoid the engine overheating. The game was one of the first to feature pit stops, which would repair damage and take on fuel.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Steve Kelly", "publishers": "Psion Software", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.27", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chequered_Flag_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAIbXJ83-Eo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/29693-chequered-flag\n"}
