The scenes include desert chases, forest rallying and Grand Canyon jumps. There are 7 levels in total, each teeming with \u2018bad guys\u2019 and scenery obstacles. You score points for each enemy you shoot down. Unusually, you get bonuses for crashing anything up to twice (as this can be perceived to maximize the action stakes for the film), but a third crash means Game Over.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Codemasters", "publishers": "Codemasters", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/82836-super-stunt-man\n"}
