{"altername_name": [], "name": "Raider of the Cursed Mine", "overview": "This is a maze game The game was recently upgraded to have 30 levels to play through. Each level shows a cross section through a mine with several floors visible and three lifts. Your miner (nice animation) must walk through the mine, using the lifts, and collect all the diamonds littered about whilst avoiding the spiders, ghost and boulder-throwing troll. When all the gems have been collected a lamp appears at bottom left which must be collected before progressing to the next level. Not a fast game, and at first it doesn't seem addictive either, but the ease with which you progress is matched by the ease with which you seem to lose lives. Getting to the 30th level rewards you with a picture of the surface. Nice graphics and sound, the clever player lines up all his lifts first.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Arcade Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "0.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RM5hlAa5u4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/115283-raider-of-the-cursed-mine\n"}
