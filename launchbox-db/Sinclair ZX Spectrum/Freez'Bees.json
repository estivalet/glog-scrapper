{"altername_name": ["Frozen Penguin"], "name": "Freez'Bees", "overview": "This action game takes its basic gameplay from Pengo, with 10 different speeds of play. It sets you as a penguin aiming to kill off a swarm of bees by pushing bricks so as to hit them as they move around, without letting them touch you. If a brick hits another brick or the wall without hitting a bee, it stops where it is, thereby changing the layout of the level and perhaps making it easier or harder to reach or avoid the bees. Before the bees hatch, their pods are highlighted in red - if you can touch these before they hatch, you get a points bonus and limit the number of bees to be faced. After completing each screen you may get a bonus, if you complete it fast enough.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Grisewood & Dempsey Computer Publishing", "publishers": "Silversoft Ltd", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOG9evlPZD0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/54500-freezbees\n"}
