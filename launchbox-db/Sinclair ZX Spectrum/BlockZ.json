If a block comes to rest touching one or more blocks then they will disappear. Make all the blocks disappear against the clock to complete the level. You get 5 chances to restart if you mess it up. You can also resume your game from the highest level you reached in your current gaming session, however your score will start at zero and you will be starting from a harder level.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "2020", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Raymond Russell", "publishers": "Raymond Russell", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/144510-blockz\n"}
