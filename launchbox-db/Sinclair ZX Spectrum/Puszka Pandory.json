{"altername_name": [], "name": "Puszka Pandory", "overview": "Puszka Pandory (English: Pandora's Box) is a Polish computer text game created in 1986 by Marcin Borkowski for the ZX Spectrum computer. The game achieved popularity after trading on the Grzybowska Commodity Exchange (including trade from a lot of pirates, which were rampant in the country at the time due to a Communist approach to copyright). The first version of the game was written in BASIC, and was wiped after the tape was accidentally placed into a tape recorder. Borkowski lost enthusiasm for the game and didn't have a second attempt. He returned to the project in 1986 when house sitting for a friend. The text compression on the ZX Spectrum computer (due to the fact that it only had 48 kilobytes of memory) imposed many restrictions on programmers, and the game was created as a challenge to see if these restrictions could be bypassed.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Marcin Borkowski", "publishers": "Marcin Borkowski", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puszka_Pandory_(gra_komputerowa)", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/7_-EZiKWw-0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/154406-puszka-pandory\n"}
