{"altername_name": [], "name": "Psycho Soldier", "overview": "Sequel to Athena, the 2D side-scroller which starred a stylized Manga version of the Greek goddess Athena as she set out to find adventure in the mortal world. This game features Athena Asamiya, a descendant of Princess Athena, who uses her new psychic powers (hence the game's title, Psycho Soldier) to clear a post-apocalyptic world of its mutant inhabitants with the help of her friend Kensu, thus allowing simultaneous two players gameplay. The gameplay consists of the usual run and jump fare typical of the genre with the added feature of a constantly scrolling background, which, added to the many \"option\"-style power-ups and Athena's own psychic blasts make the game a strange shooter/platformer hybrid.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Source the Software House", "publishers": "Erbe Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psycho_Soldier", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiArgSGJqi4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/81796-psycho-soldier\n"}
