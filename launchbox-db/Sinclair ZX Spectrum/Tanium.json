The chance has come once again from Intergalactic Federation to destroy an alien force who have invaded and taken over the planet Tanium. In your 'Quariad' stealth fighter you must fly over the surface of the planet over various levels shooting and avoiding various waves of alien ships. At the end of a level you will face a serpent like creature who needs destroying. Touching or getting shot from an alien craft will lose you one of three lives. Lose them all and it's game over. Tanium is a horizontal scrolling shoot-em-up viewed from the side with the screen constantly scrolling.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "One Week Productions", "publishers": "Players Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "0.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/123605-tanium\n"}
