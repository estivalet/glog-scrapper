There are 7 levels of gameplay, each featuring a skate park and then a cross-country section with a top-down view. In the skate park you have to collect all the flags, without leaving the tarmac too much, and within a strict time limit. In the cross-country event you must skate between a series of flags. This time there are hazards such as trees and buildings to avoid hitting.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Codemasters", "publishers": "Codemasters", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsI33rSsZg8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/122550-pro-skateboard-simulator\n"}
