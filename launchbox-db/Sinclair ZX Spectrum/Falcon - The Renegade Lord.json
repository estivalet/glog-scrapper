{"altername_name": [], "name": "Falcon: The Renegade Lord", "overview": "This arcade game features 8 different \"time zones\" comprising some 70 screens of fast and furious action. You are Falcon, a special agent of TIME, the Temporal Investigative and Monitoring Executive, a person with exceptional talents and skills. Your time machine, Falcon's Wing, allows you to travel through null-space to the past and the future. Falcon's Wing is equipped with CAIN (Cybernetic Artificial Intelligence Nexus) which is one of the most advanced computers ever devised. CAIN is linked to TIME'S massive memory banks, accessible at any point in space or time by means of your holophone. CAIN keeps you informed of others' movements within the time zones and you can pursue the renegade Lord to defeat his time-meddling. When you exit Falcon's wing, you wear a back-mounted jetpac and can closely explore the many atmospheric time zones. Key time artifacts may well have been moved around or disrupted by the renegade Lord and you will have to be alert and put to right any situation that may jeopardise future events. As well as an ever-ready trigger finger you can call upon powers of Thinkstrike and Power of Will to defeat any hostiles you may encounter. Based on the popular FALCON book series, this game captures the elements of combat and time travel with superb graphics and exciting game play.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Sentient Software", "publishers": "Virgin Games", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/94938-falcon-the-renegade-lord\n"}
