{"altername_name": [], "name": "Nigel Mansell's World Championship", "overview": "Timing smiled on Gremlin with this licensed Formula 1 simulation, as Nigel's long quest for a championship had finally come good. The game was pitched somewhere in between a full-blown simulation like F1 GP and action games like Continental Circus. Only 12 cars were in each race, which could last from between 3 and 20 laps. Before each race you can customize wing downforce, gear ratio, tyre selection and fuel load choices \u2013 pitstops are a standard feature of the longer races. The 16-bit versions include a unique 'Improve With Mansell' mode, in which a digitized version of Nigel's head appears in the top corner of the screen, offering instructions and praise.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Gremlin Graphics Software Ltd.", "publishers": "Gremlin Graphics Software", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.33", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Mansell%27s_World_Championship_Racing", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/gojEruSmnok", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133946-nigel-mansells-world-championship\n"}
