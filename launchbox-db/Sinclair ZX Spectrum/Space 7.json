{"altername_name": [], "name": "Space 7", "overview": "You chug around this place looking for the special mega Space 7 Control Computer. And no, I\u2019m not going to tell you what this looks like or where you can find it. You\u2019ll just have to take my word for it that when you come across it you\u2019ll certainly recognise it - it, erm, looks like a big control computer. You move around by using O and P to aim yourself, then hitting Q to get some speed up. It\u2019s pretty easy and you should have no trouble if you keep your speed down. Going too fast is the only thing that can really muck you up. So remember, kids - speed kills. Oh, and one other thing that can also kill you is the enemy. This is a bit of a downer cos there are loads of enemies and you've thus got a very high chance of being killed. They patrol certain areas so you can dodge them if you\u2019re clever, but if they so much as graze you, you\u2019re dead meat, or plastic or whatever. Pressing M transforms you into the special high-speed mode, but to collect useful objects (such as explosives) you must be in normal android mode. The rest of Space 7 you can find out for yourselves. You know the scenario, you know what you\u2019ve got to do. Now go off and do it. Oh, and jolly good luck - the rest of the universe is counting j on you.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Graham D.
