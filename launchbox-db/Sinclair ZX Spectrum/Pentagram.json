{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pentagram", "overview": "Having escaped from the curse of the werewulf in Knight Lore, Sabreman is back to his old exploring habits again. Disguised as a wizard, he must search the haunted forest for the long-lost Pentagram... Probably best thought of as being like SABRE WULF but in isometric 3D. Sabreman must track down the missing parts of the magic Pentagram, which must then be united and bathed in the waters from a well that lurks behind a wall of mantraps - runes must be found too, and then the Pentagram finally becomes Sabreman's personal property. The actual gameplay is very similar to Knight Lore, except that this time Sabreman can defend himself by hurling magical fireballs at the various enemies. Puzzles are frequent and deadly - objects, such as tables, logs and blocks of stone, can be moved by pushing them or by blasting them with magic, in order to access difficult-to-reach locations. The items to be collected aren't always in the same locations - the placement seems to be semi-random. As they are gathered up, they appear in the left-hand status area, under the lives remaining icon.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Chris Stamper", "publishers": "Ultimate Play the Game", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagram_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/57337-pentagram\n"}
