Each player controls between twenty and thirty characters with individual characteristics and armed with various weapons. In each scenario, each player's units are deployed manually before play commences. The computer can be in three different modes during the game; cursor mode, movement mode or ranged combat mode. Rebelstar Raiders does not feature a computer-controlled opponent, so it is strictly a two-player game.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Julian Gollop", "publishers": "Red Shift Ltd", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/115296-rebelstar-raiders\n"}
