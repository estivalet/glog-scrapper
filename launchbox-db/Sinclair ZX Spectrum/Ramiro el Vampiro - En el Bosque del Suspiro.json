Just like The Caped Crusader, which had two different games in the retail tape and a third one in a covertape! Ramire was making peace with her daugher. To get on well with her, Ramire allows his daughter to bring a friend to a slumber party. The girls are having a real good time doing Rick Astley playbacks and hanging from the lamps, but soon enough they feel really hungry. It is well know that the best food for adolescent vampires is a good dish of bloody mushrooms from the forest near Cheshire (province of Badajoz). There are quite a lot of bloody mushrooms in the forest, but can be collected only during daylight. Luckily enough, the rearm charm is still working so Ramire is able to stay a while under the sun rays. But not for long, remember? Besides, his friend the Wimpy Wizard, has told him about a special kind of mushrooms. There are four of them and grow in the crypts beneath the forest: the four mushrooms with tits. So Ramire decides not to get back home until he gets 10 bloody mushrooms and 4 mushrooms with tits.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "2022", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "The Mojon Twins", "publishers": "The Mojon Twins", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/166747-ramiro-el-vampiro-en-el-bosque-del-suspiro\n"}
