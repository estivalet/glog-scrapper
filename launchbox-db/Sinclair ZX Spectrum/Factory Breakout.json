{"altername_name": [], "name": "Factory Breakout", "overview": "Steve Crow\u2018s second game, Factory Breakout, was published by Poppy Soft in 1984. It is a game with three distinct sections, the second and third of which repeat with greater difficulty. The first section (played just once per game) is an eight-directional shooter where you have to stop lasers from reaching you until a timer runs down. The second section is a simple \u2018dodge-the-lasers-down-a-corridor\u2019 game, and the third section is a Pac-Man style platform game where you have to fall through holes in the floor to make them disappear, while at the same time avoiding chasing monsters. Factory Breakout does have some very nice, colourful and cute graphics, and is very playable. As a 1984 release it further indicated that Steve Crow was a programmer/designer to be watched. His next game \u2013 Wizard\u2019s Lair \u2013 really cemented that fact.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Poppy Soft", "publishers": "Poppy Soft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6WGDFZhUA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113469-factory-breakout\n"}
