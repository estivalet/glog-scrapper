{"altername_name": [], "name": "Knot in 3D", "overview": "Light Cycles games involve guiding a beam of light around a screen, against opponents who do the same thing. The aim is to corner an opponent so as to cause him to run into your trail. What they rarely involve is 3D graphics; in this variant they do. Your beam is either yellow or green, while opposition 'Chaser' beams are red and blue. Hitting a beam invokes Faults, gradually reducing this line to zero, which means Game Over. A guide to the Density of space (how many lines there are) is also on screen, alongside your score, which advances when another beam hits yours. The longer you survive, the more chasers are added. There are three speed levels available.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "New Generation Software Ltd.", "publishers": "New Generation Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/112491-knot-in-3d\n"}
