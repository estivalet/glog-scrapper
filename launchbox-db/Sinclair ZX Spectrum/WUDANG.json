{"altername_name": [], "name": "WUDANG", "overview": "In 1281, China is ruled by Kublai Kahn, the first emperor of the Yuan dinasty. Influenced by a force unknown to him (*), Kublai adopted a sympathetic position towards Buddhism, and a persecution position towards its rival religion, the Taoism. In the process, he ordered to burn taoist texts like the Daozang, and forced taoists to convert to buddhism. This persecution included taoist monasteries present in Wudang mountains, specially the Purple Cloud Temple, which was converted to a buddhist temple, and also set as home of a powerful noble dedicated to tea trading. One of the taoist monks refused to convert, for which he has been incarcerated in one of the subterranean dungeons of the complex, for later execution. His best friend, Qi Wen Wei, has managed to escape from persecution, but as a good taoist and Wudang quan master, he consider friendship as the most important value, so he has returned to Wudang to rescue him. Your task is to help Qi Wen Wei to rescue his best friend, fighting the imperial guards that patrol the complex.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "April 10, 2020", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "WORLD XXI SOFT", "publishers": "WORLD XXI SOFT", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtube.com/watch?v=U3FCqSjHwdw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/127597-wudang\n"}
