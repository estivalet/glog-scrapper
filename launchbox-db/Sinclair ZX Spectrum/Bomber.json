{"altername_name": ["City Bomber"], "name": "Bomber", "overview": "Bomber (called City Bomber on the title screen) is a one-key arcade game, similar to Blitz. You pilot a small airplane and your mission is to bomb the city so you can land safely. It is a one-key game, so you don't control the plane, you can only drop bombs by pressing the space bar. The plane moves from left to right across the screen, and slowly descends every time it wraps back to the left side. At the start of the game you can choose a skill level from 1 (easiest) through 5 (hardest), and an entry wave, also 1 through 5. A higher skill level means the buildings are higher, thus more bombs are needed before you can land.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "LLamasoft", "publishers": "LLamasoft", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4qg08JXtfE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/145525-bomber\n"}
