To avoid the terrible tragedy that this could entail, you must traverse the entire space to go to the grocery store in La Otra Punta, a planetary system located on the other side of the domain of the evil Petruccio Prepuccio, a well-known interstellar mobster who lives off traffic. of compresses. Petruccio's evil henchmen, blond Japanese trained in the harsh art of Kamikazism, have been fooled by the Martian Pinreleros, who have led them to believe that Marifrisky was actually the winner of the previous year's Venus wet t-shirt contest. Because of this, they launch with the whole team against our heroine's poor ship. Luckily for Marifrisky, the missiles piloted by Petruccio's henchmen are loaded with coffee, and when they burst, they will spill into space. That will help her to hold on until she reaches the grocery store (since the night before she had a spree at Sugarpop that left her freaking out). Help Marifrisky get all the coffee you can !!", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "2008", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Computer Emuzone", "publishers": "Computer Emuzone", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151296-shoot-redux\n"}
