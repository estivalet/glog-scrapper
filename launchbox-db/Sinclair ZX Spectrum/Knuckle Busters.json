{"altername_name": [], "name": "Knuckle Busters", "overview": "By 2133, crime is so out-of-control that a more advanced solution than prison is required - offenders have their minds and bodies reprogrammed to turn them into constructive and subservient citizens. As one of the few to refuse such treatment, you escape, and must find your way to freedom, through the six areas of the city, and ultimately through the city walls. You have a limited amount of time to finally escape from the city, as it is set to self-destruct. Enemies to take on with your punches and kicks include the guards and five other Re-Formed people. You must find enough food and water to sustain you as you go, as well as keys to escape and bonus items (often hidden) such as extra energy and points bonuses.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Beam Software", "publishers": "Melbourne House", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/121894-knuckle-busters\n"}
