{"altername_name": ["Soccer Boss"], "name": "The Boss", "overview": "Take control of a football team in Division 4 of the English league and guide them to the top. You start with a squad of 12 players, whose names can be changed, but have room for 15 players in total, with chances to buy and sell players. You can take out a bank loan, the level of which depends on your division. The team's formation can be customised, and as outfield players are not limited to a single position, you can customise the team's strengths and weaknesses in quite a precise way. Matches are played out by listing scorers as they happen, and are followed by a full list of the division's other results. Finances change after each match to do such as wages, gate receipts, and include incidents which are outside of your control, like staff members stealing from the gate and illegal player approaches.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Harry Whitehouse", "publishers": "Peaksoft", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/D1bTLwR8390", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147452-the-boss\n"}
