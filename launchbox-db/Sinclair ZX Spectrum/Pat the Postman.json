{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pat the Postman", "overview": "Pat has to collect Parcels from the house and get them on to the mail train. The only trouble is he's forgotten which houses he has to go to! Watch the Post Office burn as he runs for the Fire Brigade. Will he be in time? Amateur or Professional, Hall of Fame, increasing difficulty. INSTRUCTION CARD: On starting the game the screen will display twelve houses which Pat the Postman must visit to collect his parcels. The amount to be collected depends on whether AMATEUR or PROFESSIONALis selected beforehand. Pat must run along the roads, using keys 5,6,7 and 8 to control his direction, avoding any cars in order to visit the houses. On entering a house, if he is lucky and chooses one with a parcel then the computer will emit a light pipping sound and then Pat must take the parcel and deposit it inside his Post Office. If, however, he enters an empty house then an alarm will sound and his Post Office will burst into flames. Pat has to then rush to the Fire Station doorway. On reaching this point a fire engine will drive out and extinguish the flames, but if Pat is to late the Post Office will burn down, resulting in loss of life. If Pat manages to collect all his parcels then he must throw them to the mail train (using '0' key). If Pat is accurate enough and all his parcels are in the train he can start collecting more. NOTE : Bonus parcels may appear in the road, these are not deposited at the Post Office but collecting them will improve your score.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78008-pat-the-postman\n"}
