{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Malignant Gore", "overview": "Omicron Shadow Facility X... Total biological containment breach... Remote security turrets activated... The outbreak happened so fast there was no time to contain it. The biological entity codenamed 'MG101 - The Malignant Gore' consumed everything in its path. By the time the alarm system activated, only one survivor remained- a lone scientist blinded by panic. If he can get to the mainframe computer and input the self-destruct sequence, perhaps we can destroy MG101 forever. It is a suicide mission, but left untended the Malignant Gore will continue to spread until it has consumed all life on Earth. This is our only chance. Your job is to man the gun turrets and guide our survivor through the contaminated rooms of the Omicron Shadow Facility. Each turret only holds 6 bullets, so use them wisely. If you make a mistake you can use a temporal sphere to reset time and try again. These spheres are very rare, so use them sparingly. If you run out, all hope is lost!", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "2019", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tom Dentith", "publishers": "Sanctum Games", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdcC16JrJbo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/150553-the-malignant-gore\n"}
