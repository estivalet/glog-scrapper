{"altername_name": [], "name": "Apollo 11", "overview": "Apollo 11 is a variant of Lunar Lander where the player's task is to land the Lunar Exploration Module (LEM) on the moon. The game is side scrolling and when beginning the LEM is moving to the right over a mountainous terrain. To be able to land the player has to rotate it and use thrust to stop it from crashing into the ground. There are four instruments on the screen which indicate if landing is safe: vertical speed, horizontal speed, rotational speed and attitude. Next to each instrument is a light that can be either green or red. To land the module all the lights have to be green. It's also necessary to keep track of fuel as the module will crash if it runs out. When landing a score is given based on how much fuel is left and how small the landing site is.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ian Rich", "publishers": "Darkstar", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/124353-apollo-11\n"}
