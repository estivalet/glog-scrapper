{"altername_name": ["007: Licence to Kill", "007: Con Licencia para Matar"], "name": "Licence to Kill", "overview": "Become James Bond in his latest adventure and destroy the evil drug smuggler Sanchez. Guide 007 as he fights it out on Cray Cay, over Miami bay and underwater on his way to the final confrontation in 18-wheel oil tankers. Defeat Sanchez and give Bond what he wants most -- REVENGE. On every level, you'll have a control panel on the right hand side of the screen. You'll always be shown the number of lives you have left, and you'll also see important information about the level you're playing -- number of bullets, amount of oxygen, time remaining, etc. At certain times, a reticle will appear telling you to jump, shoot, etc. -- press \"fire\" to do this. Once you have mastered each scene, improve your score by going round again -- but this time it will be much harder.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Quixel", "publishers": "Domark", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.83", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/007:_Licence_to_Kill", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/55526-licence-to-kill\n"}
