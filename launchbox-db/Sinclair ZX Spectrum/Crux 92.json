{"altername_name": ["Crux `92"], "name": "Crux 92", "overview": "The plot is set in the Crux constellation. Here, the IKERI spaceship is to find new deposits of Filia, which is the main feature of the 23rd century. The problem arises when the ship needs to resupply. For such purposes, structures are built on smaller plains to modify the atmosphere so that it is similar to that on Earth. These structures are manned by robots of low intelligence who are subordinate to the main robot. However, on one of the planets, the main robot rebelled and built a huge sixty-story protective complex. In order for IKERI to land on this planet and resupply, the protagonist must destroy the main robot and activate the destruction system on each floor. Each level is one floor divided into 14X10 squares. The player must guide the robots, which are moving in a circle, to one of the mines. He can do this by changing the path using the red moving objects. After destroying the robots, the player still has to activate the destruction system in order to go to the next level.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Marek Trefn\u00fd", "publishers": "Ultrasoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjVLR1BbQtY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165777-crux-92\n"}
