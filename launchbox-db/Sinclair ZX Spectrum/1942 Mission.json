{"altername_name": [], "name": "1942 Mission", "overview": "You are a British agent in 1942, relaxing in the BRIEFING ROOM having received the instructions for your next mission. You will make your way to a GERMAN CAMP from where you must escape with the secret ROCKET FUEL PLANS. It is known these are kept in a strong SAFE but the exact location of this is not known. Some assistance may be provided by a GERMAN GUARD called SCHMIDT who is a DOUBLE agent so SCOTCH could be of some use if you meet him. You commence with an ENERGY factor of 100 and if this falls below ZERO you will be unable to continue.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tom D.
