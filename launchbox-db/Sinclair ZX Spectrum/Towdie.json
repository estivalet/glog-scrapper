{"altername_name": [], "name": "Towdie", "overview": "The player guides Towdie, a juvenile-troll-like character, through an interior and exterior of a castle in an attempt to save the kingdom of Alkria from the evil dragon Quido. The locations are all situated in or around the castle and are fantastical in nature, many loosely inspired by fairy tales. Movement from one room (screen) to the next is through flip-screen such that when Towdie touches the outer edge of one room (screen) he appears at the beginning of the adjacent room. The individual rooms consist of platforms, stairs and ropes with Towdie able to both walk and jump to navigate the castle and its obstacles. Towdie can hold up to four items at once which are then used at specific locations to solve puzzles and advance through the game. At the start of the game the player has a full health bar, which goes down in dangerous situations and once depleted the game is over. The health bar can be replenished by finding and eating Amanita mushrooms scattered throughout the castle.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ultrasoft", "publishers": "Ultrasoft", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/112858-towdie\n"}
