{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pumpkin Poe", "overview": "Many, many years ago, a young boy named Poe was transformed into a scarecrow for stealing candies from the home of a powerful sorcerer. However, the gods of magic were angry with the wizard for using this magic in such a way so they made a deal with Poe. Every Halloween night, he will be brought to life and must try to steal all the wizard's candies again. If he manages to do so, and amuse the gods, then they will force the wizard to break the curse and make him human once more! Be prepared to dodge and bounce over the denizens of the underworld, who are all ready to do the bidding of the old sorcerer in their quest to put a stop to your antics! Make your way through many different areas as you try to break the curse that has lain over you for so long. Experience all the thrills and chills of Halloween night in this charming (and chilling) platformer from Ariel Endaraues.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "October 30, 2017", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ariel Endaraues", "publishers": "Ariel Endaraues", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/150995-pumpkin-poe\n"}
