{"altername_name": [], "name": "Space Racer", "overview": "Space Racer is an action racing game with a sci-fi theme. The player controls a futuristic hoverbike, competing against computer-controlled vehicles of a similar kind. The races take place in outer space-themed environments, resembling surfaces of alien planets. The player should try to avoid collision with the other bikes to get to the finish line first; a more violent way of solving the same problem involves shooting at the opponents. The altitude of the hoverbike depends on its speed - the faster it goes, the farther away from the ground it is, and vice versa.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Loriciels", "publishers": "Loriciels", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/123130-space-racer\n"}
