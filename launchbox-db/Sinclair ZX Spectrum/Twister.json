{"altername_name": ["Twister: Mother of Charlotte", "Twister: Mother of Harlots"], "name": "Twister", "overview": "The evil Twister has a plan to ruin humanity, and only you can stop her. This involves travelling through your inner thoughts to gather the required symbols. The first level is platform-based and scrolls into the screen, with platforms arranged as with the grid in hopscotch, with one in the middle followed by one to either the left and right, then another in the middle. You must collect crystals, as well as packs of 8 shots (you start with 20), whilst shooting as many of Charlotte's minions as you can. On the second level you must collect 'Ultimate Power' by collecting each of those 13 levels, from a 3D room with full floor and ceiling interaction, by quickly swapping between the 2 surfaces, shooting and avoiding enemies in the process. Level four (of six) adds a rocket launcher, allowing you to move around the whole screen. Eventually you must face down and shoot the Twister in the throat to kill her.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sensible Software", "publishers": "System 3 Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.62", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQMC8TWIUPo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/92632-twister\n"}
