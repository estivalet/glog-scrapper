{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gnasher", "overview": "Gnasher is a game based on the classic Pac-Man. Like most other Pac-Man clones gameplay stays very close to the original tried and tested formula. The player controls a chomping yellow blob, Gnasher, and must manoeuvre Gnasher around a maze chomping on dots. When all the dots have been cleared the player progresses to the next level. In the centre of the maze are four ghosts who will chase Gnasher and, if Gnasher is caught one of his three lives are lost. Around the maze are four energy pills that Gnasher can eat. For a short time after eating one of these pills the ghosts turn blue and are vulnerable allowing Gnasher to eat them and gain bonus points.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jon Nixon", "publishers": "Mastertronic", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "0.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/lO3RcRxm9l0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148121-gnasher\n"}
