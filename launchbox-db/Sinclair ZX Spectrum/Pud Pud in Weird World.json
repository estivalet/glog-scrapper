{"altername_name": ["Pud Pud"], "name": "Pud Pud in Weird World", "overview": "Pud Pud in Weird World (also known simply as Pud Pud) is a computer game published by Ocean Software in 1984 for the ZX Spectrum. The player controls Pud Pud (who resembles a round pudding with wings or feet depending on whether he's walking or flying) and must explore the maze-like Weird World. Pud Pud has a limited amount of energy which needs to be topped up by eating certain creatures that live in Weird World although other creatures, which drain his energy if eaten, must be avoided. If Pud Pud runs out of energy he loses one of his three lives. Mrs Pud Pud occasionally appears on the screen and is similar to Pud Pud but white and wearing high heels. If she touches Pud Pud he loses a life instantly, regardless of his energy status although the player will receive a bonus score based on how much energy was remaining when Mrs Pud Pud delivered her kiss. Pud Pud can obtain an extra life by collecting all ten hidden puddings. The puddings are spread randomly through the maze with only one being in the maze at a time. When all ten are collected, Pud Pud can escape Weird World.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Christine Smith", "publishers": "Ocean Software Ltd.", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pud_Pud_in_Weird_World", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_e7w4ITin8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/17375-pud-pud-in-weird-world\n"}
