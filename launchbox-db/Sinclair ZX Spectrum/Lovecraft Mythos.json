{"altername_name": [], "name": "Lovecraft Mythos", "overview": "The primal horrors have awoken! The entire cosmos is destined to be consumed in unspeakable despair while humanity is powerless against beings who defy the rules of the Universe itself. Or is it? Our only hope rests in the hands of a single individual. With just his trusty Colt, guts of steel, no sanity remaining and an uncanny resemblance to the late Charles Bronson, he alone will rise to the ocassion and prove his worth against monsters feebler minds are unable to comprehend. The Game Lovecraft Mythos is a survival platformer. Collect 9 keys to advance to the next screen, trying to avoid the eldritch monsters which will continuously respawn around you. Shooting a monster will kill it instantly, but be wary of the limited ammo. Try to conserve it as much as possible. You can only survive a limited number of hits, represented by the hearts at the top left corner. Every time you clear a screen, your remaining life and ammo will be restored. In addition, the game will always start at the last screen you reached. Progress through the 8 existing screens to win honor and glory, which will be useless because the game will start again from the first screen and you'll die anyway.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "January 1, 2019", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ancient Bytes", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Horror", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R98jUA1D55c", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/115558-lovecraft-mythos\n"}
