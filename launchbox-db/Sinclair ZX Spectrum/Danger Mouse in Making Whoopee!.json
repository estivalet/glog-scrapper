{"altername_name": [], "name": "Danger Mouse in Making Whoopee!", "overview": "Based on the animated series, this game has Danger Mouse trying to foil Baron Greenback's latest attempt at world domination through hundreds of whoopee cushions which he'll place on United Nations seats to cause chaos. The evil toad has also kidnapped your friend Penfold whom you must rescue. It consists of two parts: a 3D maze, and platforming areas. Driving your Mousemobile around town, you must find warehouses with items you can use to give to characters so that they will not block your path. There are also store rooms where you can exchange items. You then will find electricity stations and gas factories that you must stop from powering the Baron's Whoopee Works which is also your final goal. Each location found then has you play as a platformer where you must run, jump, climb in order to find the objects you need. In the Whoopee Works, you must pop enough whoopie cushions in order to foil the Baron's plan.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Creative Sparks", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/102933-danger-mouse-in-making-whoopee\n"}
