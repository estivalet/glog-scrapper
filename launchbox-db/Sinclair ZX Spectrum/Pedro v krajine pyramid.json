{"altername_name": ["Pedro 3 - v krajine pyramid"], "name": "Pedro v krajine pyramid", "overview": "After the successful and glorious return from the haunted castle in the Carpathians, Pedro thought that he had had enough of dangerous expeditions. That's why he decided to take a break from everything for a few weeks and go on a well-deserved vacation. Together with their friend Gina, they agreed to visit the land of pyramids and sphinxes, Egypt. However, it quickly became apparent that while Pedro wasn't really looking for any adventure this time, adventure found him. Immediately after arriving at the hotel, his girlfriend disappeared somewhere. When Pedro returned to his room, the phone began to ring. A muffled voice informed him that his girlfriend had been kidnapped and that if he did not do what was demanded of him, he would never see her again. The kidnappers demand that he penetrate through a secret passage into the pyramid of Pharaoh Cheops, where a mysterious flying creature of non-terrestrial origin is supposed to be located. From this creature, Pedro must get an egg, which must be delivered to the kidnappers within three days, otherwise he will never see his beloved Gina. Pedro already knew that many adventurers had gone in search of this mysterious creature in the past, but none of them had returned alive, so he had never attempted it himself. But now he doesn't have much of a choice.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gold Storm", "publishers": "Ultrasoft", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT9ztMaGukk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165832-pedro-v-krajine-pyramid\n"}
