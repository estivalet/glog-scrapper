{"altername_name": [], "name": "Master of Magic", "overview": "Thelric the Wizard has kidnapped you by beaming you into his world, and will only set you free if you recover for him the Amulet of Immortality. The game engine is menu-driven, using the joystick to select options from menus to activate each of the game's main functions. The screen display has both top down and side-view representations of what is going on around you, plus measures of your mind and body health, and an inventory. To help, Thelric teaches you four spells - a magic missile to attack creatures, a burn spell which works over a wide radius, a spell to drain enemy energy, and a magical shield. Additional weapons (including daggers and a mace) and potions can be collected throughout your quest.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "James Wilson", "publishers": "Mastertronic Added Dimension", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.62", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Magic_(1985_video_game)", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/6nJmAgJv7WE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148324-master-of-magic\n"}
