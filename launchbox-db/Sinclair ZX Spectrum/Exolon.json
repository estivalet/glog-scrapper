{"altername_name": [], "name": "Exolon", "overview": "As a heavily armed humanoid, you blast, battle, bound and blunder your way over more than hundred screens of blood curdling action. Release a deadly grenade to devastate a birth pod and shoot the hordes of aliens that slither and scramble to overwelm you. Rocket a gun emplacement and pneumatic hammers hurl you end over end back across the screen. And in a new twist, some of the screens can be played as a vulnerable but athletic Vitorc or as Exolon, a lumbering but powerful exoskeleton.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Nick Jones", "publishers": "Hewson Consultants Ltd", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.33", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exolon", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/53569-exolon\n"}
