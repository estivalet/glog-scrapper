{"altername_name": [], "name": "Jawz", "overview": "Jawz is a race against time underwater hunting game. At the upper part of the screen there are several objects which resemble the Atlantic Portuguese man o' war firing lethal darts bellow. At the middle of the screen a school of little sharks swims from one side to another trying to evade the player's sight. They could be useful as a shield for the player's targeting apparatus from the fired darts above. To successively conclude the level the player needs to hit all sharks of the school before the clocked time reaches the zero. The scenario of the game is always the same, but the level of difficulty will increase each time a level is completed.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "dk'tronics", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/tFwAVvOtqBU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148267-jawz\n"}
