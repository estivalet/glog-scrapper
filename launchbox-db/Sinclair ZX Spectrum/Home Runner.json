{"altername_name": [], "name": "Home Runner", "overview": "The goal of the game is to get the man to run from the base of the screen to his house (located in the part from the top right). To achieve this, he will have to avoid being bitten by the giant spiders that They voraciously try to reach you. They start at the top of the screen, and They descend through holes, filling them in their path. But To do this, another hole will appear on the same level. While all this happens, a BONUS counter is decreasing, so, when you get home, you'll have the remaining bonuses. The faster you get it, the more points you earn.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Steve Gardener", "publishers": "Britannia Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148161-home-runner\n"}
