{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mutant Ant Attack", "overview": "Your miniaturised laser tank is under attack from marauding ants which have mutated into a super-species.. Your mission is to destroy them, wave after wave as they relentlessly march towards you bent on your total destruction. So says the inlay. It's a little misleading as it conjures up the idea of animated ants homing in on your tank, which isn't quite what happens. Mutant Ant Attack is actually a grid game played out on a screen which wraps around both vertically and horizontally. Your tank and the mutant ants all move along the green lines of the grid. Should you fire, the missile travels off the screen and re-enters on the same line from behind. It's therefore essential to get off that line as fast as possible after firing if you don't want to blow yourself up. The ants are character blocks with detail in them. They form up in lines and march about, the line gradually breaking up into clumps of individuals. The ants don't actually make a beeline (sorry) for you and content themselves with marching around, performing neat military manoeuvres along the grids.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/125296-mutant-ant-attack\n"}
