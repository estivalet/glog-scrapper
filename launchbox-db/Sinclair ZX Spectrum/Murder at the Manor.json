Quietly scaling the wall the thief reaches the Squire's bedroom... The Squire, dosing in an arm chair is disturbed. He sits up alert, but uncertain. From above, sharp taps are heard. He decides to investigate and,grabbing a sharp poker, cautiously ascends the stair. Meanwhile the thief's attempt to open the safe is a failure. In desperation he searches the room, looking for other valuables. A small notebook is his only find, in which, surprisingly, the safe combination is given. Ripping the page from the book, the safe is opened and robbed. Opening the door, the Squire spots the thief making towards the window. Pulling him back into the room a fierce fight ensues. However, the Squire, an older man, is soon overpowered and falls to the ground dead. The murderer now makes good his escape scattering the pieces of notepaper throughout the area to avoid detection. Next day, the murderer fits back into his usual life style, confident he will never be detected. But unknowingly a vital clue remains in the safe, if only it can be opened...", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Gemtime", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148361-murder-at-the-manor\n"}
