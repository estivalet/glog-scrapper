{"altername_name": [], "name": "Binary Land", "overview": "Binary Land is a game created in 1984 by Kikuta Masaaki and published by the Hudson Soft company for various Japanese computers such as MSX and later reverted in 1985 for the Famicom console (Japanese Nintendo NES), this time changing its human characters for penguins. With quite original mechanics, the game proposed us to control the two characters at the same time but in a horizontally symmetrical way, the objective of the game being to lead them through the labyrinths avoiding obstacles and enemies until they reached, together and at the same time, to meet the end of level. The game consists of 100 levels (although there are certain patterns that are repeated throughout them), and when you complete them the game starts over from scratch. An arcade game from the 80s where the objective was to try to get the highest score.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "2020", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Joflof", "publishers": "Joflof", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/144455-binary-land\n"}
