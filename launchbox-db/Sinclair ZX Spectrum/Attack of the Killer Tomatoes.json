{"altername_name": [], "name": "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes", "overview": "There's Wimp in at 9, and just about to begin another day's work, when he discovers that the tomatoes have mutated. In his fight against the clock Wimp must nab the Killer Tomatoes and hole them before they pip him to the post. Then there's the Pizza Parlours who have to be supplied regularly with puree from the bouncing ones; and it's a long trek to those crushers. Being a wimp though, there are several objects scattered around to help him in his bloody fight. As a bit of a cheat, he can gain more time by finding some punch cards and clocking in, if he can remember where to find the machine. But he'll have to discover which object will allow him to defeat the might of the bouncing, time consuming, killer tomatoes.
