You are at home waiting for your unemployment check when it arrives with a bit of a surprise attached to it.

Waiting in line at the post office to correct the mistake, young prince William, who's mother Diana is also waiting in order to collect her wedding allowance, grabs your check and runs away with it. In your quest to recover the check, you meet various members of the Royal Family, the Prime Minister and the Archbishop of Canterbury. H. R. H. is a traditional text adventure made using the Quill adventure generation software from Gilsoft.
