{"altername_name": ["Way of the Exploding Fist"], "name": "The Way of the Exploding Fist", "overview": "This menacingly-titled beat 'em up was the first in many martial arts titles from Australia's Melbourne House. Sixteen different moves are on offer, ranging from standard kicks to jumps, somersaults and roundhouse kicks. The move executed each time is defined based on the character's direction, the joystick/keyboard positioning, and on whether the fire button is depressed, in a system which became standard on single-button control systems. To win each bout you must score 2 Yin-Yangs - a perfectly executed kick/punch scores a full one, whereas a less forceful contact offers half a point - the best moves also offer more points. In the one-player game, you advance through a Dan by winning two successive bouts, and a single win for the opponent means game over. The champion in a two-player duel is decided by points after 4 rounds.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Beam Software", "publishers": "Melbourne House", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.27", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Way_of_the_Exploding_Fist", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA5b8Zhdb7c", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/52998-the-way-of-the-exploding-fist\n"}
