{"altername_name": [], "name": "Quondam", "overview": "You\u2019re in control of a fighter plane far in the future, flying through the tunnels of the Quondam Matrix, viewed from overhead. Located throughout the matrix are 43 hangars, of which 15 contain pieces of a jigsaw. Your objective is to fly to all 15 hangars collect the right jigsaw pieces and slot them all together to create the Quondam picture. The other 28 hangars house weapon supplies, entering these accesses either a homing missile or a shield for your plane. Vicious aliens in many shapes and forms also fly through the Quondam matrix firing at you with their weaponry. Happily you can do the same to them and shoot them to the ground.
