{"altername_name": [], "name": "Galaxy Attack", "overview": "This is a real zaparoony of a game with loads of playability, but be warned, you need to be an alien with three hands or a 15-digit Uruggian for keyboard control. The program comes in three parts: in space as you approach the Uruggian's planet, you must destroy their waves of fighters by centering the sight cross hairs; then on the planet's surface, where your landed ship is surrounded by walkers and fighter; and then the finale attack on the orbiting mother ship. Control response is good, colour and sound excellent, and the simple response is good, colour and sound excellent, and the simple 3-dimensional aliens work well. Recommended.
