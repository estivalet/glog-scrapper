{"altername_name": [], "name": "Muncher!", "overview": "Muncher! is a Pac Man variant. The main change here is that the booth in the center contains bonus fruit, instead of launching the ghosts, and also a key must be picked up in order to open it and grab the fruit inside. As always, the player must avoid the ghosts and collect the dots, with power-pills available so as to make the ghosts edible, for bonus points and to buy some time.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/125302-muncher\n"}
