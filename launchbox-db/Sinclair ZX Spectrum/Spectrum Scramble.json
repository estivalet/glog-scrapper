{"altername_name": ["Scramble (Profisoft)"], "name": "Spectrum Scramble", "overview": "This version of Scramble uses only the missile stage. That does not detract from its playability and in some ways it is more difficult than its bigger brother. The missiles are certainly larger and the large player ship is an easy target. An unusual feature is that you can steer the ship diagonally. although if you use those control keys as well as the others you could become confused.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Profisoft GmbH", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8ntzUi4RTM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/115418-spectrum-scramble\n"}
