{"altername_name": [], "name": "Chimera", "overview": "Chimera is an action-adventure game written by Shahid Ahmad and published by Firebird in 1985. A huge spaceship threatens to destroy Earth. One person must board the vessel and activate its self-destruct mechanism to make it explode, saving Earth. In Chimera, the player moves through an isometric maze of 8 x 8 screens. The player must try to gain access to hidden or blocked areas of the spaceship, often searching for items in order to circumvent various obstacles. Once the obstacles are disabled, the player may use items to create a warhead and carry it to one of the \"blue\" rooms of the ship. Upon activation of all four warheads, the player must reach the green room in order to complete the quest. The player must also attend to his water and food reserves, which run out faster when carrying something or when in a hot room. Both water and food can be found in the maze occasionally. If the reserves run out, or if the player tries to disable an obstacle with an incorrect item, the player dies and has lost the game.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Firebird Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.8", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimera_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/92134-chimera\n"}
