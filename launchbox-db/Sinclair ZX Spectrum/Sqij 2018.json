{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sqij 2018", "overview": "Sqij has an interesting story. It was originally released for the C64 in 1986. It also recieved an official \u201cport\u201d for the ZX Spectrum in 1987, but that version has famously been called \u201cthe worst Spectrum game ever\u201c, so I\u2019ve taken it upon myself to remake the C64 version for the ZX Spectrum. Read more about the original Spectrum version at the bottom of this page. So what is Sqij? Well, at its feathery heart the game is a multi-screen maze game. You play as Sqij \u2013 a bird tasked with collecting the lost pieces of a tree \u2013 and bringing them to a holy cave where it can grow. The caverns are full of nasties you\u2019ll have to dispose of, and you\u2019ll also have to find keys to unlock barriers that block parts of the caves.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "January 3, 2018", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "TARDIS Remakes", "publishers": "RGCD & Psytronik Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDJro6L9XR8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/105941-sqij-2018\n"}
