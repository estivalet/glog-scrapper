Every cabinet, every motherboard and every ROM has started to vanish from the world as he slowly gathers his collection together. Gamers are angry, and have sent you to the castle to get them back so humanity can once again enjoy these classics. Dr Game has locked the games deep inside his sinister castle; a maze of rooms, passages and locked doors. Some of the rooms he has made to look like the games he has already collected, so be prepared as you venture inside.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "November 25, 2020", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "", "developers": "Paul Jenkinson", "publishers": "Paul Jenkinson", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyKRojqIZdk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/158128-the-castle-of-dr-game\n"}
