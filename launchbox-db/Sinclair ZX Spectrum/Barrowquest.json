{"altername_name": ["Barrow Quest"], "name": "Barrowquest", "overview": "The screen display divides into four parts. The top two lines of the display give power and stamina scores and a verbal description of the player's current location. Initially, power is set at 100, but it may be increased by winning fights, by entering charmed places or by finding power enhancing objects. Stamina is initially set to 200 and cannot be increased beyond this point. It will, however, decrease as the game continues and when it reaches 0 the game will end. Stamina can be increased either by Eating (the player presses t to eat) or by resting at a hotel in one of the Borderland Towns. Food and Hotel rests cost money. The Player begins with 200 crowns, but may find more, in the form of Barrow Treasure, as the game progresses.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "John Sherry", "publishers": "CCS", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Giw2zkouKQo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/103024-barrowquest\n"}
