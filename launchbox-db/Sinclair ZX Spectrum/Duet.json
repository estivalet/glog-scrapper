{"altername_name": ["Commando '87"], "name": "Duet", "overview": "After much delay and name changes (Commando '86 and Commando '87), this game was ultimately published on the 6-Pak compilation as Duet. Choose your tactics. Either go it alone and rely on your stealth and cunning to penetrate enemy territory or be part of a human machine - a crack Commando pair where survival means co-operation and teamwork. Whatever your method, the brief remains the same - collect vital documents from each area and return safely. The task is not an easy one. With minefields to avoid, tanks and foot patrols to out maneuver, the odds are heavily against you. So grit your teeth and prepare for combat!", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Hit-Pak", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/O5fqCk7FHnE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147723-duet\n"}
