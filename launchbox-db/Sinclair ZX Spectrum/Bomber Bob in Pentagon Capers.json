Jump your caped superhero Bomber Bob around a series of 50 rooms in the Pentagon, avoiding meanies and collecting bombs planted by evil Kaptain Kleptor. Each room is titled with an appalling pun.

Like many Speccy games of the time, it starts out very easy but quickly becomes insanely difficult.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Timothy Closs", "publishers": "Bug-Byte Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/OWR0uuxO2UY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147451-bomber-bob-in-pentagon-capers\n"}
