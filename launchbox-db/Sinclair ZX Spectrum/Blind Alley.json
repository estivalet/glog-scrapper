{"altername_name": [], "name": "Blind Alley", "overview": "Blind Alley depicts a sport set nearly a millennium from now, in which you are in control of a spacecraft and must defeat opposing craft. Gameplay resembles the Tron Light Cycles game, being played out on a grid, with more and more ships as the game progresses. Each craft has its own motion trail, which remains on the screen throughout the game, and a round is lost by a ship which hits one of these trails or the screen border. Control is directional rather than rotational, so attempting to reverse is fatal. This version has no 2-player mode, but supports Kempston joysticks and runs within 16K of memory.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Sunshine Books", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/114943-blind-alley\n"}
