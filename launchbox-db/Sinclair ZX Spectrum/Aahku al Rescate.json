{"altername_name": [], "name": "Aahku al Rescate", "overview": "Grognors always have been peaceful creatures. Although their fangs and their pointed ears, they always have been beloved by Green Land people. They only can speak three words, they like to eat \"serranito\" (typical Andalusian sandwich) and their hobbit is to bit pieces of plaster in a compulsively way. They are quiet and harmless by nature and when they fall in love, it's forever. But Grognors have got enemies too...the awful \"Stick-o-man\", the infamous \"Maximus Krab\" and, the worst of all of them, the unpredictable \"Littliwormy\" are gathering to tease Aahku (our favourite grognor), caging his girlfriend Aljka. Can you help to our hero? Just one more thing. Did I tell you that grognors can't swim?", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "2011", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Baron Ashler", "publishers": "Kabuto Factory", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.68", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/57683-aahku-al-rescate\n"}
