{"altername_name": ["Do-Do and the Sno-Bees", "Do-Do"], "name": "DoDo", "overview": "DoDo is a rather slow-paced clone of Sega's Pengo. You're a man in the middle of a screen filled with blocks, and with enemies approaching you from all directions. Your only way to take out the enemies is to push the blocks at them, thereby crushing them. The nasties are able to crush blocks which are not moving, though, so that you must hurry so as not to run out of blocks to use either as a weapon or a cover.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gary Capewell", "publishers": "Blaby Computer Games", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/119053-dodo\n"}
