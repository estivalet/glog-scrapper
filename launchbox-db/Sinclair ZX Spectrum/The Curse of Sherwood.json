{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Curse of Sherwood", "overview": "Sherwood Forest has been taken over by the evil and ruthless Cult of Sagalia. Robin and his men fight on bravely, but the odds are stacked against them. You, as Friar Tuck are their only chance of survival. Solve the clues hidden in the rhyme and destroy the evil force. Robin Hood and his merry men are confronted with their biggest challenge to date! The evil Cult of Sagalia has taken control of Sherwood Forest instilling fear into the hearts of the forest dwellers. They are relying on you as Friar Tuck, Robin and the rest of the band to rid the forest of this evil force and then get back to normal pursuits like robbing the rich to give to the poor! In the meantime Robin and his men battle valiantly on, but the odds are definitely stacked against them. Werewolves roam the forest day and night watching and waiting for any likely looking prey (actually they're not particularly fussy!). Hideous animated skeletons appear when they're least expected and should you be unfortunate enough to come across one of the Priests of Salagia, well, your days are numbered! Already one attempt to rid the forest of the Cult has failed. You had arranged to meet the Bishop of Derby to try to carry out an exorcism. When he failed to arrive on time you set out to look for him and at the edge of the forest you find his body, he had been slain by a black arrow. But on his body you notice a piece of blood stained parchment bearing the following rhyme, could this possibly be the answer?", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Derek Brewster", "publishers": "Mastertronic Ltd.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/93895-the-curse-of-sherwood\n"}
