{"altername_name": [], "name": "Peter Shilton's Handball Maradona", "overview": "Rather than attempting to simulate the whole game of football, this title concentrated on the goalkeeper's task of saving shots. In each match you will face a succession of shots from different distances and angles, and aim to save as many as possible. 16 teams were included for you to select your team and opposition from. There's a practice mode, and a skill challenge, where you move up through the game by saving 4 successive shots. The C64 version has a little sampled speech and extra sound.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Roger Womack", "publishers": "Bug-Byte Software", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LhsgzNuuyc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/125278-peter-shiltons-handball-maradona\n"}
