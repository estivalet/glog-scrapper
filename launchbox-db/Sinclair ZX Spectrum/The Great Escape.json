{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Great Escape", "overview": "The Great Escape is a video game which shares a title and similar plot to the movie The Great Escape. It was programmed by Denton Designs, who went on to produce the similarly acclaimed Where Time Stood Still. It was published by Ocean in 1986 for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC and DOS. The gaming environment is displayed in isometric 2.5D with the player's character initially in bed at the beginning of a day in the camp. The prisoner has a daily routine, along with all the other prisoners, which includes roll call, exercising, mealtimes and bedtime. The other prisoners will follow this routine and, if the player does not control the main character for a short period of time, their character will join in the routine. There are soldiers guarding the camp and they will attack the player if he is seen out of routine (prison guards only detect prisoners in their line of sight).", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Denton Designs", "publishers": "Ocean Software Ltd.", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.73", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Escape_(1986_video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKNzSiiyN8g&t=442s", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/53000-the-great-escape\n"}
