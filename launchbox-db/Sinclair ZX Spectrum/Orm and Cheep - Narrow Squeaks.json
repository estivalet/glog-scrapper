{"altername_name": [], "name": "Orm and Cheep: Narrow Squeaks", "overview": "Orm and Cheep: Narrow Squeaks is a game based on the British children's puppet TV show from the 80s on CITV, where the two main characters are friends, Orm (Worm) and Cheep (Bird). The game is split into four mini-games with the first three single-screen side-view games and the last one is a vertically-scrolling game where the screen scrolls upwards constantly viewed from an elevated angle. Before you start the game you have to play a Reaction test to find out the difficulty of the game. The words Orm and Cheep are at the start of the screen and move down one at a time. You have to stop each word as close to a line by pressing a key. After each game has been played you are giving a score by removing squares from a picture and the better your score, the more of the picture you see.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/115467-orm-and-cheep-narrow-squeaks\n"}
