{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tribble Trubble", "overview": "Brian Skywalker is a tribble farmer on the planet Noom. When on a mission to round up wild tribbles to increase his stock, his Noomrover runs out of fuel and Brian is forced to herd his captured tribble back to base on foot. Luckily, tribbles are (fairly) obedient and if they are close to Brian they will go in the direction he is facing. Brian himself is pratically indestructible, but various tribble-zapping hazards must be overcome before the pair can return safely to base.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jim Scarlett", "publishers": "Software Projects", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/92002-tribble-trubble\n"}
