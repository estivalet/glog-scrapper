{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tremor", "overview": "Tremor is an arcade action maze game. You control a Miracloid droid around a 400-room map, avoiding 20 types of enemy whilst collecting 10 jewel-shaped \"qigit\" objects. Each \"qigit\" must be dropped onto an associated dock, somewhere else on the map. Controls are left/right/thrust/jump/fire (similar to JetPac). There are power-ups etc. in some rooms. Gameplay is mainly about exploration, with some quick reactions called for when enemies spawn in tricky situations. You can only hold 3 objects at any one time, so a certain amount of swapping and dropping objects is required. The game intro featured some 1-bit sampled speech.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Timothy Closs", "publishers": "Americana Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/123968-tremor\n"}
