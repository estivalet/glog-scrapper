{"altername_name": [], "name": "Jumbly", "overview": "There are 11 slider puzzles in the game consisting of 20 squares. Select a puzzle by its title and press J to jumble it up. Use the direction keys to move the blocks adjacent to the empty space and unscramble the puzzle. The game is made harder because most pictures are animated and many designs move from square to square; you can use the View key to freeze the picture as it should look, and squares in the wrong position are in black and white. If you take more than the target number of moves to complete the puzzle, you will be given the chance to try again with an increased target.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Don Priestley", "publishers": "dk'tronics", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/121871-jumbly\n"}
