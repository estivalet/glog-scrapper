{"altername_name": ["They Stole a Million"], "name": "They $tole a Million", "overview": "TSAM looks like an management game but, on account of numerous logic/strategic elements, it overcomes that genre. Also it can't be classified as clear strategy. Considering the action elements which can be interwoven in this type of game, like controlling the crew in pitstop in CRL's Formula One, TSAM is far beyond any other. The game is consisted of two parts, first one we can call \"preparation stage\" while second is a place where you plan and commit robbery. Players interface is realised as four directional moving through nested menus that pop out when we request them with the fire key as validation. Via keyboard we can use keys from 6 to 0, if Sinclair joystick is selected. In the game you take a role of gang boss, perspective newcomer in the world of crime, who builds his career by successive entering in more and more risky deals.
