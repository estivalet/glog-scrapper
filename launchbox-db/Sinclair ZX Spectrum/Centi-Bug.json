{"altername_name": ["Centipede"], "name": "Centi-Bug", "overview": "This is a straightforward clone of the arcade game Centipede. A long slithering alien being gradually moves down a gridded playing area and must be shot out before it can reach the bottom, with the ability to move your ship in all 4 compass directions. Curiously, it doesn't seem to be possible to get a joystick to work in this, despite the chance to define keys.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "dk'tronics", "publishers": "dk'tronics", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78516-centi-bug\n"}
