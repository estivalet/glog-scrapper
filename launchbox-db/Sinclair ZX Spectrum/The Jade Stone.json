You, Amora, daughter of Lord Senidea, are engaged to Amanton, an attractive guy who is, however, a bit of a wimp. On hearing that the evil Mallumo of Kradoom is about to declare war against your dad, Amanton declared that he would sort out said villain, in the hope of improving his standing with your father. With a limp wave, he trotted off towards Kradoom, and hasn't been heard of since. That was until today, when a ghastly Putron (a servant of Maliumo) delivered a ransom note to your dad..... The note read \"Amanton held prisoner. Will release him in exchange for your daughter or your kingdom. Signed Mallumo.\" Enraged your father screams \"Idiotic future son-in-law! Suppose I'll have to rescue him!\" and before either you or Sajo, the Lords' adviser, can stop him, your dad goes east, shouting \"CALL OUT THE ARMY!\"..... Sajo shakes his at the sight of the army heading into battle and whispers to you \"THE JADE STONE is the only thing that can stop Maliumo and that has been lost for many a year now.\" Assist Amora to locate the \"JADE STONE\" and thus find the means to destroy Mallumo.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Linda Wright", "publishers": "Marlin Games", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148266-the-jade-stone\n"}
