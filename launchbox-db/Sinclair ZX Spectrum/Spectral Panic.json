{"altername_name": [], "name": "Spectral Panic", "overview": "Based on a well-known arcade game, this program has your little character running along several layers of walls, climbing ladders and generally being chased silly by vicious green meanies. In order to survive you will have to destroy all the aliens by digging pits and luring the unsuspecting nasties into them. Once the alien is in the pit, you must beat him about the head until he dies. WHAT A GAS Unfortunately, things are not all in your favour - you only have a limited amount of oxygen, so that excessive movement or taking too long will lead to your demise. Needless to say, if you are captured you will lose a life. Superb graphics, colour and sound all combine to make this an exciting game - it will have you sitting on the edge of your seat, but keep calm and don't panic!", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hewson Consultants", "publishers": "Hewson Consultants", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/115272-spectral-panic\n"}
