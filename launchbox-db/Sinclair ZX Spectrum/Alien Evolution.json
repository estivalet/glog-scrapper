{"altername_name": [], "name": "Alien Evolution", "overview": "We are in a time after a nuclear holocaust, and the face of the earth and its very hostile site unable to support the existence of human life. Long ago, the survivors retreated about underground complexes, and now, after many years of exhaustive research they have created a android, CYBORG 64, which can be the solution to your problems. These problems are based on the fact that a race of strange aliens have left Earth, they have installed in it and no longer want to leave. Although CYBORG will continue to exterminate the first aliens will have to fight next with another wave of them, which will emerge from lso remnants of lso first. This process will continue during four different evolution of the aliens, each one smarter than the previous one. CYBORG will have to face five times the number of the first enemies, which he defeated at the beginning of his struggles. You see lso problemitas... You need a lot of skill and nerves of steel to help CYBORG in his fight. It's played looking down to the surface of the planet; there are transporters that will take you from one place to another. You will have to choose your weapons carefully, since some only kill a certain type of alien. Sometimes it may be useful to catch one or more aliens. This can be done by moving the blocks through the screen.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Marco Paulo Carrasco", "publishers": "Gremlin Graphics Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.35", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/102226-alien-evolution\n"}
