{"altername_name": [], "name": "Space Command", "overview": "Your task is to guide and protect the Asteroid with its domed city through many star systems. You may encounter Alien life-forms whose orders are to seek and destroy you and the domed city. The city is protected by a two stage force field whose energy banks become weaker after many impacts. The Defence Computer is programmed to automatically lower the force field to protect the populated areas only, leaving the rotating radar and communications dish open to alien attack. If it is hit you lose a life. The space craft you pilot is equipped with the finest lasers to shoot the Aliens. The strength of the laser is indicated by the analogue scale in the bottom right-hand of the screen. Heavy use of the laser will deplete it and it will no longer function until it has time to charge up. There is also an analogue scale at the bottom left-hand of the screen to indicate your fuel status. Fuel is an exnaustable source of power therefore if you use it all up you will be unable to manoeuvre the spacecraft left or right. In order to traverse to another Star System you must beat off all the Alien Lifeforms in the current Star System. A successful mission (ie the elimination of a complete set of Aliens) and you will be credited with an extra life up to a maximum of nine.
