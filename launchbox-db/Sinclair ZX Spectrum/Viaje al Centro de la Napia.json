{"altername_name": [], "name": "Viaje al Centro de la Napia", "overview": "Miguelito was everything but a whiz. That\u2019s why, on the first day her mum took him to the special class for adolescents still in 2nd grade at the primary school (the famous SCFASISGATPS), he felt a little bit lost among so many geniuses, so many books, and su much science. He just sat down in his hexagonal desk, down headed and looking straight to the floor, kind of ashamed. The teacher was babling about something barely understandable. He had a severe headache and was getting seriously bored. In front of him, a brand new box of wooden pencils (brand Alpino), just bought, stared at him defiantly. So Miguelito began burying one by one all the pencils inside his nose. He thought he was really good at this, as he held several records since he was at the kindergarden. She just wanted to blow off his personal record and try to introduce the whole box of twelve pencils! Well, he was now a pupil at the SCFASISGATPS. That was another level, he had to take the challenge. After he buried the white pencil, the last one still left in the box, he suddenly felt how he stopped hearing his teacher and the picture turned blurred. Miguelito closed his eyes and fell down his desk, plunged into a deep coma. When he woke up, he was in front of a huge, enormous nasal orifice. He didn\u2019t know how he got there, he was just positive that, if he didn\u2019t remove the twelve pencils from his skull, he could never escape from that nightmare\u2026", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "2010", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ubhres Productions", "publishers": "Ubhres Productions", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151823-viaje-al-centro-de-la-napia\n"}
