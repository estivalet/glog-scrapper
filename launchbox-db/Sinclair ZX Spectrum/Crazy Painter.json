{"altername_name": ["Slap Dab"], "name": "Crazy Painter", "overview": "Crazy Painter aka Slap Dab is a clone of Amidar. It initially had the same name, but was renamed to avoid legal difficulties before its release by Superior. The player controls a creature and needs to paint levels divided into rectangles of various sizes. They are painted by moving over the bordering edges, colouring them. When a rectangle is traced entirely, it is filled with a colour. Meanwhile enemies that roam the edges need to be avoided. There is also a limited amount of jumps used to get out of tricky situations. The character has a number of lives and the game keeps tracks of the score.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Iain Bullock", "publishers": "Sinclair Programs", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lirSSkebOEI&t=83s", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/52422-crazy-painter\n"}
