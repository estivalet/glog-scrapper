{"altername_name": ["Los Demonios de Valaquia"], "name": "Cursed Demons Of Wallachia", "overview": "From the diary of Professor Abraham Van Helsing: \"I stand before the dark gates of Count Dracula's castle, with my gold cross in hand and determination in my heart. My mission is to find and destroy the succubi that infest this place before the Count returns from his nightly hunt for new victims. I have no stakes, so I'll have to search for them throughout the castle. But I'm certain I can find everything I need to accomplish my task. With my gold cross in hand, I'll move through the dark corridors and sinister rooms, facing the cursed demons that serve their master. I must find the coffins that house the succubi and drive wooden stakes into their hearts to end their reign of terror. The garlic cloves will help me to keep evil away from me. I also have to defeat the cursed demons that serve Dracula and roam the entire castle. To escape this place, I have to find the opposite drawbridge from the one I entered and break the curse that prevents me from escaping. I can only flee once I've defeated all the succubi, obtained all the garlic cloves, and destroyed all the cursed demons. I know the task won't be easy, but I'm willing to face any danger to complete my mission. I must be cunning and brave, and not let fear stop me. Time is short, Count Dracula could return at any moment, but I'm determined to succeed in this dangerous adventure and leave this place alive\".", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "April 28, 2023", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Furillo Productions", "publishers": "Furillo Productions", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pelG_n4vO8w", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/368263-cursed-demons-of-wallachia\n"}
