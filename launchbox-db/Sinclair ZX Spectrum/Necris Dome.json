With a growing population and resources, especially land, becoming ever more scarce it was decided that all of earth's dead would be placed in an orbiting cemetery known as the Necris Dome. This dome was staffed by robots, or mandroids, with one Arch-mandroid being in overall control. For many years all was well but gradually rumours about the Necris Dome began to emerge, he has begun to think for himself and is building weapons with which to attack Earth. Earth has been at peace for many years and all weapons have been banned so to counter this threat the player, taking on the role of a Special Forces operative, is smuggled on board the satellite with orders to investigate and neutralise the threat. The game starts with the player arriving on board the station in a casket.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Codemasters", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78812-necris-dome\n"}
