{"altername_name": [], "name": "Stop Ball", "overview": "There are two types of screens, each with dIfferent objects, these alternate as you play the game. On the first screen you need to keep the ball up in the air, by manoeuvering your bat so that the ball bounces on the bat rather than on the ground, you can drop a single block at any point on the grid where you think the hall will bounce so that you can cover the other areas of the grid. You do this by pressing fire. When the time runs out you move onto the next screen, this is of the second type, here you score points for visiting the gates that are situated in the corners, and in the form of a cross in the centre. You die if you collide with any of the balls that are bouncing around. When you have visited each of the four corners, you move onto the next screen.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dro Soft", "publishers": "Dro Soft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "0.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113367-stop-ball\n"}
