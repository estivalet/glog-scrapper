{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gulpman", "overview": "Gulpman is a small man that you must guide around one of a selection of mazes eating fruit. Once a level is clear of fruit, you start again only everything is a bit faster. Four nasty faces are on your tail and must be avoided at all costs, or they rob you of one of your lives. However, you do have a limited number of laser blasts which when activated fire out in all four directions around Gulpman, sending any nasty face they touch back to its starting corner.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "John A.
