{"altername_name": [], "name": "Freedom Fighter", "overview": "An alien invasion force is approaching your home planet, and your peaceful people have but one weapon... one hope... Will your skills be enough to fly the Freedom Fighter? You must fight off the invading alien hordes, before they take over your planet. You will be attacked by waves of alien fighters, who will swoop down and fire a hail of missiles at you. Along with the alien attack craft, concussion bombs have been fired at you, and if they are allowed to reach the bottom of the screen you will be killed. To stop them doing this you must pick them up in your craft and they will be disarmed. At the end of each wave you must face an alien mother-ship which will take several hits to destroy.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jon Paul Eldridge", "publishers": "The Power House", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.88", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGEvEjt_SMk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/119521-freedom-fighter\n"}
