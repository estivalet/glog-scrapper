{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Wombles", "overview": "The Wombles is an action game, that was developed by Enigma Variations for Alternative Software, and released on the Sinclair ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC and Commodore 64 in 1990; it is based on the FilmFair television series of the same name (which aired upon BBC1 from 1973 to 1975, but had been brought back into the public consciousness by a sketch on Central Television's Spitting Image, in the previous year). Also, even though all the Wombles are on the front of the cassette's inlay card, only three of them actually appear in the game itself - Orinoco (he is controlled by the player), Great Uncle Bulgaria (he gives him his instructions), and Wellington (he tries to steal things from Orinoco).", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Enigma Variations", "publishers": "Alternative Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/104112-the-wombles\n"}
