{"altername_name": [], "name": "Don't Panic", "overview": "Climbing into your Droid Loader, you leave the safety of your space cargo vessel to locate and return various radioactive items to the ship's hold. Armed only with a decontamination laser you suddenly come face to face with the raving monster that haunts the loading bay... DON'T PANIC! The Game: You are in control of a Droid, whose job it is to load a space cargo vessel with various items scattered around a multi-level loading bay. The cargo has been contaminated with deadly toxin which can only be removed with a shot from the Droid's decontamination laser. Purified cargo can be nudged along the loading platforms with more shots from the laser, to eventually fall down the shaft and into the ship's hold. Coloured sections of platforms can be used as elevators. When loaded with sufficient cargo, the space vessel will take off and on to the next screen. From Screen 2 onwards, mutant toads will appear - these can be knocked off the end of a platform with well-timed shot. Meanwhile, you must avoid - at all costs - the indestructable alien that haunts the loading bays and who is feeling rather H-U-N-G-R-Y!", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Andrew Rogers", "publishers": "Firebird Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/54504-dont-panic\n"}
