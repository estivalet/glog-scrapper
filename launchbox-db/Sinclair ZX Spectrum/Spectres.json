{"altername_name": [], "name": "Spectres", "overview": "Spectres is a Pac-Man styled game in which the payer takes on the role of Eddie who's job description probably says he's a 'Maze Maintenance worker.' Eddie is an electrician. His job is to replace all the light bulbs in a maze, a maze that's naturally enough populated by ghosts. As the player / Eddie walks around the maze they leave a trail of light bulbs behind them. When Eddie reaches a generator all light bulbs currently placed will light up, this makes any ghosts in the lit areas vulnerable. However, when the generator burns out it disappears and takes all the bulbs with it. When a ghost catches Eddie it takes him to the centre of the maze where there's a pen with an electrified fence. Eddie enters, a life is lost, and providing there are lives left, the game resumes with all previously placed light bulbs still in position. Points are scored for light bulbs placed and ghosts captured.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Bug-Byte Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.12", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/29729-spectres\n"}
