To escape he must collect barrels with ingredients necessary to make fuel, and find letters for passwords on terminals to unlock a space shuttle... and of course he must avoid enemies, who's touch is lethal. Technically Luna Atac is a platform game, but the hero can't actually jump, special elevators must be used to travel between platforms. He has limited energy, each contact with enemies or spikes deplete it (and restarts his position on screen). When all the energy is gone, the game is over.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atlantis Software", "publishers": "Atlantis Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/96848-luna-atac\n"}
