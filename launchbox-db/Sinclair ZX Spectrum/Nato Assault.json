{"altername_name": [], "name": "Nato Assault", "overview": "An essential game from Astros Productions for those busy people amongst you, scared away from wargaming by struggles of marathon proportions, simply to learn the game and win. Here (in this single player game), you are drawn into combat almost immediately, with defeat or victory less than an hour away - is this a chilling reflection on future war? Despite the description in the clearly written manual, which sets the battle in the future, there is little in the battle plan and weaponry that differs from a tank encounter in the Second World War.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/121802-nato-assault\n"}
