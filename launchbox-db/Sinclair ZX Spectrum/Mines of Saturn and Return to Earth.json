{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mines of Saturn and Return to Earth", "overview": "Mines of Saturn and Return to Earth is a double games pack of two text adventures that follow each other in story. Both games have text on the screen describing each location you are in and you type in commands with the keyboard to interact with your surroundings. The two games are: Mines of Saturn: During a routine orbit of Saturn you encounter a radiation storm which forces you into the rings causing you to lose your ships energy. The only solution is to make an emergency landing on the planet's surface which was successful and luckily you landed next to an old abandoned mine full Di-Lithium Crystals. Your mission now is to enter the mine and collect enough crystals to re-fuel your ship and leave Saturn. Return to Earth: After managing to get away from Saturn you reach Earth Station 1 but can't get radio contact. After a dangerous manual docking sequence with the station, you discover it abandoned with the control room destroyed. You need to somehow get in touch with Earth, letting them know of your location but be careful, there is evidence of alien life-forms.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Saturn Developments Limited", "publishers": "Mikro-Gen Ltd.", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/166984-mines-of-saturn-and-return-to-earth\n"}
