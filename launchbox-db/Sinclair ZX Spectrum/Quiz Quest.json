{"altername_name": [], "name": "Quiz Quest", "overview": "Quiz Quest is a trivia game with questions in five categories: pop, sport, general knowledge (easy and hard) and TV. In each category there are about 200 questions but included is also a program that allows the player to create new questions. The game concept is based on the game Quiz Cards by Waddington Games. The player has to answer correctly a sequence of eight questions. For each question there are three alternatives to choose from. After all eight questions have been answered the player is given a report on the number of errors made and will then return to the first incorrectly answered question from where a new sequence begins. The game goes on until all the original eight questions have been answered correctly. The aim is to do so in the shortest possible time.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Alligata Software", "genres": "Quiz", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/125306-quiz-quest\n"}
