{"altername_name": ["Los Amores de Brunilda"], "name": "Brunilda", "overview": "The first time I arrived at this town I realized that something strange was around the head of its inhabitants. He breathed that cold dusk air that is beginning to put into the body. Everyone began to pick up in their homes, closing at lime and singing so that night they would not surprise them defenseless before their twisted terrors. It was as if this town had no soul, as if it had moved away from God and had abandoned superstition. That feeling I tried to forget but my partner could not. He was quite younger and he still did not dominate his terrors. But really, my biggest concern was to look for a place to spend the night; More than by monsters and demons, for the cold, another night more to serene and my bones would give me the tin to Santiago.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "December 23, 2013", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "retroworks", "publishers": "Monument Microgames", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/128092-brunilda\n"}
