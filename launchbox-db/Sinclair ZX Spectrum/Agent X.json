{"altername_name": ["Agent X in the Brain Drain Caper"], "name": "Agent X", "overview": "There are four sections of the game, each loaded separately. The first level sees Agent X driving a car which travels along a diagonally scrolling road, and is under constant attack from other road users who try to ram it off the road or trap it behind obstacles. The player can make the car jump to avoid crashes. The next level is a basic fighting game; enemies approach from the left and right and must be defeated by kicking or punching them. The third level is a first-person target shooting game in which various objects are hurled towards the screen and must be shot. The final level involves the player controlling Agent X in a helicopter, avoiding missiles and crushers. The player must negotiate a cave complex using the helicopter, collect a bomb, then return it through the caves to destroy the professor's headquarters.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Software Creations", "publishers": "Mastertronic", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.97", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_X_(1986_video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78770-agent-x\n"}
