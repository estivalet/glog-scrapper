{"altername_name": [], "name": "Astro Blaster", "overview": "Astro Blaster is an unofficial adaptation of the arcade Astro Blaster, a traditional spacial shoot-em-up game which combines some elements of arcade classics such as Galaxians and Asteroids, also including the concept of a final \"boss\" as the passage for the next level. The player manoeuvres an armoured spaceship on a left/right axis while floating on deep space. The arsenal of the spaceship is capable of completely destroying an enemy with a single shot. Each stage is constituted by 2 sets of 5 different enemy armadas, a meteor storm and the final boss: a heavy armoured giant Asteroidal spaceship. Also in the traditional arcade line, after you succeed completing the 5 armadas, the process repeats itself turning the game-play increasingly more difficult after each stage is complete.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Glenn Flood", "publishers": "Investronica S.A.", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2PiEY9PpDM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/117887-astro-blaster\n"}
