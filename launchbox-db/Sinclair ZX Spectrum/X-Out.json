{"altername_name": [], "name": "X-Out", "overview": "X-Out is a horizontally scrolling shoot-'em-up. Unlike most comparable games (e.g. R-Type), the game is not set in outer space or even in the air - instead, the fight between good and evil is underwater. Through five levels, the player has to shoot countless enemies, complete with the obligatory mid-level and end-level bosses. After having completed a level, the player gets to purchase new weapons; instead of simply buying upgrades, it is possible to customize the ship by placing new weapons anywhere on it.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Arc Developments", "publishers": "Rainbow Arts", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/104076-x-out\n"}
