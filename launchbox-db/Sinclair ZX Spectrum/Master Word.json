{"altername_name": [], "name": "Master Word", "overview": "Choose the number of letters - from two to six - for your challenge. Then pit your wits against the computer, or another player, to find the mystery word. After each attempt the computer reports how many letters you have guessed correctly in the right place, and how many correct, but in the wrong place. There are ten goes for each problem, and the computer clock ticks away as you strive to find the answer. There are thousands of words in the program. You can enter your own words too. Whatever your age this mind-expanding game will provide hours of absorbing entertainment - and strengthen your word power too!", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Hill MacGibbon", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/r3UUFZhSEyg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148325-master-word\n"}
