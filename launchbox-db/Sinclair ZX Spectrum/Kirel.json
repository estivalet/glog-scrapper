{"altername_name": ["Kirel"], "name": "Kirel", "overview": "Kirel is a 2.5D isometric puzzle game (the gameplay is in full 3D, camera can be rotated by 90 degrees). The player controls the \"Kirel\" creature, and he must catch bombs, and find exit items to get to the next level. Kirel can manipulate environment blocks, but only one at a time, and can not jump to a height/lower greater than 1 block. He also must avoid monsters - they are almost unkillable, unless Kirel has a special item. Every contact with them quickly drains Kirel's stamina - our creature can find food items to easily kill enemies. The game has 70 levels.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Zafi Chip", "publishers": "Zafi Chip", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.12", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113027-kirel\n"}
