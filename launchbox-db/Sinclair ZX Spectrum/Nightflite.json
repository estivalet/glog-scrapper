{"altername_name": [], "name": "Nightflite", "overview": "Full flight simulation was offered in this innovative early release. Landing at night (so as to keep the graphics simple and the running speed high on a 3.54Mhz system), you must take off, climb, control the plane mid air, and then land successfully. As well as basic steering, rudders, flaps, wheels and airspeed come under your control. There are five different flight challenges featured, including navigation as well as flight skills, plus a rolling demo on startup. A full instrument panel is provided for each of these, allowing you to judge speeds and distances.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mike Male", "publishers": "Hewson Consultants", "genres": "Flight Simulator", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/73u95S6fE8Q", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147135-nightflite\n"}
