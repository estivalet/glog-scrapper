{"altername_name": ["Mountie Mick's Death Ride"], "name": "Mountie Mick's Deathride", "overview": "Mountie Mick's Deathride is a platformer in which the player takes the role of Mountie Mick who has to stop bandits from raiding nine trains. The screen automatically scrolls from right to left which means he has to keep moving until the front of the train is reached. Then he swings onto a handcart to get to the next level. There are many obstacles on the way, examples being jumps between wagons, gas leaks or dark tunnels. Collected gas masks and torches help to survive the two latter. However, most of the time Mick has to deal with the bandits themselves. Those try to kill him, but this can be avoided by dodging the bullets, shooting back or jumping on their heads. Also both parties have grenades to their disposal.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Timedata Ltd.", "publishers": "Reakt\u00f6r Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/122221-mountie-micks-deathride\n"}
