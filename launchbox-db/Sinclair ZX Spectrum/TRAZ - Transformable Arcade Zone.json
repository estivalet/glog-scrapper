{"altername_name": ["TRAZ"], "name": "TRAZ: Transformable Arcade Zone", "overview": "Transformable Arcade Zone is a Breakout clone with multiple paddles, 64 levels and a built-in level construction set. Each level can have different set of paddles, sometimes one at the top and one at the bottom, sometimes one left one right, sometimes four stacked-up etc. This gives each level a distinctly new gameplay. There are unbreakable blocks, monster generators (also unbreakable) and glass refractors that change the balls movement angle as it passes through. After a level is cleared, the player must choose the next level by moving on a 8x8 grid of levels.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nigel Speight", "publishers": "Cascade Games", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/134280-traz-transformable-arcade-zone\n"}
