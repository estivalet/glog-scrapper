{"altername_name": [], "name": "Rapid Fire", "overview": "An undercover cop must destroy a warehouse owned by a group of bank robbers. This is achieved by reaching the master level where the central power electrode is stored, but in order to reach this level, the previous levels must be negotiated. The cop also has to shoot various thugs with his machine gun, which overheats after heavy use. At the end of some levels, a plasma computer needs to be destroyed before the cop can proceed to the next level. This is done by shooting the rotating plasma vent where bolts are fired toward the cop.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Roger Womack", "publishers": "Mastertronic Ltd.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "0.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/115289-rapid-fire\n"}
