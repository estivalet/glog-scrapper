{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tarantula", "overview": "Throughout the game you are equipped with a jetpac allowing you more manoeuvrability than the insects. On most screens this advantage must be used to persuade the insects to go one way, and at the last moment you quickly change direction, leaving the insects going the wrong way, while you destroy their eggs and escape unscathed. You will also find that the order in which you destroy the eggs makes a difference in the survival stakes, as certain eggs destroyed reveal even more insects to evade. You will find that not all screens are immediately hostile, some will allow you a few more seconds grace before the insects attack and you may even find the odd sanctuary where you can have a rest to collect your thoughts.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mike Westlake", "publishers": "Creative Sparks", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/122888-tarantula\n"}
