{"altername_name": [], "name": "Fish!", "overview": "JUST WHEN YOU THOUGHT IT WAS SAFE TO GET OUT OF THE WATER: The tide is turning in the teeming metropolis of Fishworld. The oceans and seas are boiling off into space. The Seven Deadly Fins - an interdimensional group of anarchists - are on the loose. The project has been sabotaged... And you're a goldfish. Tough. But then life's like that. Sometimes you're dealt a real deal. Toast falls buttered-side down. Phones ring when you're in the bath. And there's always chili sauce on your kebab. From rain-soaked forests and London recording studios to the farthest reaches of time and space, Fish! will bemuse, dazzle and thrill you before confusing, razzling and killing you. Fish! is brought to you by Magnetic Scrolls, authors of such classic award-winning adventures as The Pawn and The Guild of Thieves. It's full of what you're least expecting, lacking in all that's rational, and devoid of much that could reasonably be expected... So, dust down your tackle, dress up your flies, reel in a winner and play Fish!", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "magnetic Scrolls", "publishers": "Rainbird", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.17", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish!", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/88870-fish\n"}
