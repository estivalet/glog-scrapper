{"altername_name": [], "name": "Riding the Rapids", "overview": "Paddle through the wild waters of 4 different courses avoiding hazards, such as rocks, islands & land banks to beat the course record. You must negotiate all the gates, keeping the red poles always to the right. If you hit a pole, you shall receive a 5 sec penalty. If you miss a gate altogether, a 10 sec penalty shall be incurred. Paddle fast for the best possible time, but be careful to avoid running out of energy. If you capsize, paddle frantically in all directions to right yourself. Good Luck and be careful, those wild waters are just waiting to get you.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Andrew Severn", "publishers": "Players Software", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_Zjsjg8P4M", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/115313-riding-the-rapids\n"}
