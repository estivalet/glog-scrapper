{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mister Gas", "overview": "MISTER GAS is a nice bubble from the upper reaches of the cava, which has been socially reduced to any soda factory by a leak in the piping system. Such humiliation cannot be allowed by the most traveling bubble on this side of MISSISSIPPI. Being reduced from being one of the wealthiest bubbles on the market to being a vulgar component of soda! Being ingested by the jet-set and being able to climb their privileged heads or be swallowed by anyone from the common people, and then simply be expelled! Or worse still be mixed with wine! She! Thought and designed to satisfy the most exquisite palates in the country. To avoid being the laughingstock of his own, he must reach the rusty tap that ends in the proper conduit for his privileged status.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Xortrapa Soft", "publishers": "Xortrapa Soft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/ZQJknEvnjjg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148355-mister-gas\n"}
