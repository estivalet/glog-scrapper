The objective is to increase assets to \u00a3500,000 in 50 to 75 weeks (depending on difficulty). The game is text based and played by entering commands.

For each week three decisions can be made. Possible options include buying land, seeds, tractors and harvesters, hiring labourers, planting seeds, fertilising, harvesting, irrigating, spraying against insects and selling crops.
