{"altername_name": [], "name": "Woods of Winter", "overview": "Woods of Winter is a text based adventure game where your goal is to escape from the woods to the safety of a castle. To manage this, you will need to traverse deep gorges, brave vicious wild boars, cross a moat, and find a key to unlock the castle entrance. The cold is a continual problem, and you must find a place to warm up every so often or you will freeze to death. The game map is shown graphically, with small icons depicting the areas as they are explored, and lines representing possible exits connecting the areas. Your current position on the map is highlighted by a flashing cursor. The main text region provides feedback to your text instructions and describes the items present in each scene. A more detailed text description of the surroundings, along with a graphical depiction (a larger version of the icons) is available with the press of a key. Cryptic location specific hints are available just by typing HELP.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Andrew Patrick", "publishers": "CRL (Computer Rentals Limited)", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/145660-woods-of-winter\n"}
