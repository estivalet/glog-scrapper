{"altername_name": [], "name": "Kemshu", "overview": "You start on a square board that is split into 100 multi-coloured squares. The aim is to change all the colours on the board to a single target colour, indicated in the right of the screen. This is achieved by sliding the columns and rows of tiles until an uncorrected coloured square is surrounded by squares of the target colour. Changing the colour of all the squares within the given time limit gains access to the next level. A status box to the right of the screen shows the present score, percentage of screen area covered, time limit and the target colour.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nick Fleming", "publishers": "Cult Games", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJhJ9oQL77I", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/121877-kemshu\n"}
