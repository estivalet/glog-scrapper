{"altername_name": [], "name": "Nanako in Classic Japanese Monster Castle", "overview": "Mya, witch apprentice and Nanako\u2019s younger sister, decided to break all rules in palace and, disobbeying his mentor\u2019s orders, parted away to He\u00fan Tower to improve her knowledge in dark magic. The old tower, surrounded by a magic halo knitted by God only knows who, was populated by a whole army of karakasas among a multitude of other kinds of tzukogamis (inanimated objects which become conscious after they are more than 100 years old). Commonly, they are not hostile at all but, the way Mya broke into the tower made them get very angry and become really dangerous. Poor Mya refugeed in a chamber located at the top of the tower, unable to descend the 25 floors and return home, surviving miserably during several weeks. Nanako, heavily worried about his sister\u2019s disappeareance, made some research and soon discovered a dim clue which led her to follow her Sister\u2019s path to the Heun Tower. Her mental connection with Mya made the rest. With firm step, Nanako entered the tower to rescue her sister. She just had to find her so they could together create a connection to be teleported to a safe place. Then main problem was to dodge all those karakasa to get to Mya!", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "2007", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "The Mojon Twins", "publishers": "The Mojon Twins", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/150698-nanako-in-classic-japanese-monster-castle\n"}
