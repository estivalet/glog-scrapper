{"altername_name": ["Aventura Original, La"], "name": "La Aventura Original", "overview": "In the mid-70s a unique phenomenon occurred in the history of computers: two Americans, Willie Crowther and Don Woods wrote the first adventure by computer, it was the Original Adventure. It was written in FORTRAN for a DEC PDP-10 and it occupied more than 300 K of memory. Soon it became a cult for elite programmers who could, or knew, access the databank where it was located. Like any cult, it had its first martyrs: several important programmers were fired for being so \"hooked\" on it that they were found late at night playing it, while they were supposed to do overtime. In the United States it was the base that inspired Scott Adams to start making his famous adventures. In Britain, Peter Austin, founder of Level 9, the most prestigious English adventure house, confesses to having been driven by it since its inception (one of his first adventures was his version of the Original Adventure). In our country, without it, there would be no company of Adventures AD, or sections on adventures in major magazines, it was what gave impetus to Andres Samudio to get fully into this world. Now we hope you are part of that Universal Brotherhood, because the first game of AD, the result of 8 long months of research and work, had to be: The Original Adventure.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Aventuras AD", "publishers": "Aventuras AD", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Aventura_Original", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/53948-la-aventura-original\n"}
