{"altername_name": [], "name": "Road Toad", "overview": "As can be surmised by the attentive punter, Road Toad is a clone of Frogger for the 16K Spectrum. The graphics are bold, with a three lane road with little space for the frog (or toad) to manoeuvre, and a snake on the other side of the road to make life more dangerous before it's time tocross the river. The game takes place on time, and you must make it over in less than 100 time units, which are tangibly shorter than a second.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "dk'tronics", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/115340-road-toad\n"}
