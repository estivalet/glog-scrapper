{"altername_name": ["Asterix y el Caldero Magico"], "name": "Asterix and the Magic Cauldron", "overview": "Goscinny and Uderzo\u2019s cartoon characters are from the only Gaullish village in 50BC able to resist the Roman invasion. They can do this due to Getafix the druid\u2019s magic potion, however the cauldron used to make this has been smashed into several pieces. Can brave Asterix and overweight Obelix find the pieces? In this arcade adventure, it all comes down to you. The fifty screens you must explore take in your home village, a Roman encampment, and the forests in between. You have five pieces of wild boar, and these are used as you become hungry. Contact with wild boars or Roman soldiers triggers a one-on-one fight with punches and kicks. Defeating a boar earns you another piece of food, to restore energy once all lives are gone. Some sections are blocked until you collect their keys.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Beam Software", "publishers": "Melbourne House", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.17", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterix_and_the_Magic_Cauldron", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy4iY-FCQes", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/28474-asterix-and-the-magic-cauldron\n"}
