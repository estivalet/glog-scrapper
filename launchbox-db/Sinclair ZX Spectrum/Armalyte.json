{"altername_name": ["Armalyte Demo"], "name": "Armalyte", "overview": "Originally Published for the ZX in Demo form in Your Sinclair - covertape from magazine issue #65 - 1991/May. Somewhat finished as longer play ROM Hack in the mid 90's using level and sprite information from the Commodore to approximate the full eight levels. In the Delta region of space, the remnants of a long forgotten war remain - far beyond what those in the Terran system were used to. This technology is potentially valuable, but retrieving it from the 8 sectors will involve a lot of blasting and dodging. Armalyte is a left-to-right horizontally-scrolling shooter and was marketed as the sequel to Delta, even though that one was done by different developers. Extra weapons are gained by shooting crystals and then collecting the resultant pod. Weapons on offer including lasers firing vertically and outwardly, as well as faster weaponry recharging. Weapons upgrades are not lost when dying, but they are taken away at the start of a new level, except for the batteries and the generators that are reduced one level above the initial one, if applicable.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "May 6, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Cyberdyne Systems", "publishers": "Your Sinclair", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/157903-armalyte\n"}
