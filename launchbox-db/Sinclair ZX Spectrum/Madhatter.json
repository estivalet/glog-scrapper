{"altername_name": [], "name": "Madhatter", "overview": "Madhatter is a game which has lithe if anything to do with Alice in Wonderland. The title is very much an excuse for a simple idea. The scenario seems mad enough; it's the Madhatter's Un-Birthday and some friends are supposed to be coming for tea. Unfortunately the place is in a dreadful mess and must be tidied up. The mess seems to be made from sweets and chocolate rolls, the very things he needs for the tea. The object of the game is go around picking up ten sweets for each roll and hitting the top of the screen. Each time you do this a roll appears in the score line and after five have appeared you go onto the next screen. The unpleasant side of life here are the mice, which steal sweets (and don't forget you need ten sweets for every roll), the vacuum cleaner on the right of the screen which kills on contact, and other objects which fly across at random, also killing. And that's about it.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "0.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/125131-madhatter\n"}
