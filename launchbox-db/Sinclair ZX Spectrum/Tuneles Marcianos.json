{"altername_name": ["Tuneles marcianos"], "name": "Tuneles Marcianos", "overview": "Although clearly a distant cousin of Jetpac, Tuneles maintains it's credibility by framing the action in a format not entirely dissimilar to Fantasy's Ziggy hit, The Pyramid. Screens of uglies alternate with a display of inter-locking cells which reveal your current game position. The ultimate aim of the game is to travel to the final cell located in the upper left hand corner of the screen.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "ventamatic", "publishers": "Ventamatic", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/112762-tuneles-marcianos\n"}
