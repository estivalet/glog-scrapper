{"altername_name": [], "name": "Broodslayer", "overview": "Broodslayer is an arcade adventure viewed from above with the screen showing a small part of the surrounding area with the screen scrolling when you move. You play the role of a warrior in a territory called the Outland, whose quest is to find the nest belonging to a Broodsmother and destroy her thus stopping her Broodlings from overrunning the land. The land is made up of plains, rivers, forests and swamps, with a Labyrinth of Chaos to explore as well as dark tunnels, temples and towers which contain items to collect and use. As you explore you will encounter Broodlings who fire venom at you, and you have to press a number on your keyboard to use your shield to match the direction of the venom. If you use the shield then the venom bounces off and kills the Broodling, if you don't use the shield in time then you lose part of your power and the Broodling disappears. If your power reaches zero or you walk into a wall then it is game over but your progress can be saved. You are armed with a sword and this is needed to defeat the Broodsmother when her nest is located.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "John Sherry", "publishers": "CCS", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/6U3CLYm78XA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147447-broodslayer\n"}
