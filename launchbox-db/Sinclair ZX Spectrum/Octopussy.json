{"altername_name": [], "name": "Octopussy", "overview": "Based on the James Bond film of the same name, Octopussy does not copy the complete story, but only its first third. The structure of the game is based around finding objects and solving puzzles to move the story along. Players can control James Bond, complete in white tuxedo, and use the 'Fire' button to display a menu to manipulate an object (pick it up, attempt to use it, or throw it away). Despite being unlicensed and not part of the official James Bond videogame canon, the game was released in Slovakia complete with cassette inlay and full instructions in 1992. Some time afterward, an English-language version was also made available.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Bytepack", "publishers": "Ultrasoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/95481-octopussy\n"}
