{"altername_name": [], "name": "Fred's Fan Factory", "overview": "Fred's Fan is an ingenious game in which the balloon men float upwards. By rushing along the bottom passage you can switch fans on and off to blow them safely past dangerous spikes and whirling enemies, through the safe passages, and up to freedom. The gentle pace at which the balloons move is no guide to the speed of the game, for you will have to sprint from one switch to the next in order to save all your balloons.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Pat W.
