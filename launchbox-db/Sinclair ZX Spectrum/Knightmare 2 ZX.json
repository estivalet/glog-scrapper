{"altername_name": [], "name": "Knightmare 2 ZX", "overview": "In keeping with the original MSX game, this game is also a platformer, but otherwise radically departs from the second installment format originally designed for MSX and known as The Maze Of Galius. Unlike the previous version released in 2012, this new installment has been specifically designed for all 48k Spectrum and is perfectly compatible on all models. There are ten levels, a fight against Galius at the end of the game, a smooth side scrolling movement (maybe a little rough at the beginning, but you get used to it quickly), interesting backgrounds, masked close-ups and well-resolved oriental-style intro music.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "2015", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Climacus", "publishers": "Climacus", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/150309-knightmare-2-zx\n"}
