{"altername_name": [], "name": "Zythum", "overview": "The Zythum is a magical drink, which, when imbibed, generates unknown powers. It lies hidden in the depths of a forbidding castle, which can only be reached by crossing four extremely hostile territories, each of which is guarded by custodians who must never be allowed to touch you. You have 8 minutes to cross each land. If this time runs out, you will have failed in your quest and the game will end. If a custodian gets you, you will lose one of your 3 lives.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mirrorsoft", "publishers": "Mirrorsoft", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.62", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_MpUDO04Cs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/104055-zythum\n"}
