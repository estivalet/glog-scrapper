{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pac-Mania", "overview": "Pac-Mania is a one player game in which you manoeuvre Pac-Man through a World of 3-D mazes. Armed with unique BOUNCE power, Pac faces new challenges as he enters the worlds of Block Town, Pac-Man's Park, Sandbox Land and Jungly Steps. Start the game by selecting level 1, 2 or 4 - the higher the level the more difficult the game. Your objective is to eat all the dots and power pills in the mazes whilst at the same time avoiding those pesky ghosts. Boss ghost Clyde has recruited the talents of two new ghosts, Sue and Funky, making Pac's journey even more troublesome. However, eat a power pill and the ghosts will temporarily change colour, giving Pac the chance to munch his way to extra points. Pac also has the help of two \"special items\", a green and a red power pill. The GREEN pill adds temporary speed and the RED pill awards double points. FRUIT may also appear and when eaten will add bonus points to your score. If you are Pac-Maniac enough to have reached the next maze world before running out of lives, don't despair as there is the option to munch on!!", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Krisalis Software Ltd.", "publishers": "Grandslam Entertainments Ltd", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Mania", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/57227-pac-mania\n"}
