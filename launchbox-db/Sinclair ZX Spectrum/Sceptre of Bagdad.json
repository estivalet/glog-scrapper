{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sceptre of Bagdad", "overview": "You're Caliph - king of Iraq. An evil wizard from distant land broke into your palace, transforming it into a maze of traps and puzzles, and taking the sacred Sceptre of Bagdad. Unless you can recover it, your spell as ruler is finished. Featuring lots of enemies to dodge, platform-style jumps and object manipulation, the game resembles the Dizzy games, with a Jet Set Willy-influenced setting. There are many objects you need to use, but you can only carry two at a time. You have three lives with which to complete the game.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Productive Playtime", "publishers": "Atlantis Software Limited", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/112566-sceptre-of-bagdad\n"}
