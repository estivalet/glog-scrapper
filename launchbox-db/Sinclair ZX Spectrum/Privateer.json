{"altername_name": [], "name": "Privateer", "overview": "Privateer is a single player game with three distinctly different stages or missions. There are three levels of difficulty to the game. The player does not play the Privateer, instead they play the captain of a British gunboat sent to track and sink Privateers. Stage 1: Before the player can engage the privateers they must deal with a shore battery. The game asks for an elevation and the delay for how long after firing your shell explodes. When both numbers have been entered and the shell has fired, a graphic shows the track of the projectile. Stage 2: The objective is to get within a firing range of the privateer in varying wind conditions. Stage 3: The final battle is quite tactical as the player cannot return fire until their first mate, Mr Bush, reports that the guns are ready, making every shot crucial to the outcome of the fight.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "M.C.
