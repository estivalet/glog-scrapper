{"altername_name": ["F-19 Stealth Fighter"], "name": "Project Stealth Fighter", "overview": "The original 8-bit predecessor to the now better known F-19 Stealth Fighter. Take control of a top secret classified Lockheed F-19 and fly missions in Libya, the Persian Gulf, Scandinavia, and Central Europe, with a variety of selectable mission parameters such as rules of engagement, escalation of conflict, risk, type of target, and skill levels with regards to landing and fighting. Similar in scope and design to F-19 Stealth Fighter, but otherwise a completely different game, with graphics and physics more aligned with the capabilities of Gunship than with its 16-bit remake, completely lacking its speed, polygonal complexity, and features such as external chase camera, tactical views, and side/rear views. According to original co-designer Arnold Hendrick, \"The only thing borrowed from the C64 would be the game scenario concepts, military equipment research data, and perhaps some flight dynamics algorithms\".", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "MicroProse", "publishers": "MicroProse", "genres": "Flight Simulator", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/108196-project-stealth-fighter\n"}
