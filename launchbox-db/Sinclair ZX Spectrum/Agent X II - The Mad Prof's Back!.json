{"altername_name": [], "name": "Agent X II: The Mad Prof's Back!", "overview": "Agent X II is split into three different subgames. The first level is a side scrolling shoot 'em up in a similar vein to Gradius. Level 2 is a platform game, set in a tower of screens, each with three floors. Each screen contains a computer terminal, a floating code number, and an assortment of enemies. Agent X must jump from level to level collecting codes, entering them into the computers and killing the aliens. After three codes have been entered, a final code must be typed into the lowest terminal and a snake-like alien destroyed before the task is completed. The third and final level is a Breakout clone.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Software Creations", "publishers": "Mastertronic", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.24", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_X_II:_The_Mad_Prof%27s_Back", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3P1kK3S0oM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78771-agent-x-ii-the-mad-profs-back\n"}
