{"altername_name": [], "name": "Nicotine Nightmare", "overview": "Nicotine Nightmare is a game in which the protagonist has the main task to stop a tobacco industry from producing cigarettes. The game starts with a screen very similar to Pssst in which the hero has to extinguish some cigarettes with a watering can paying attention to a devil who from time to time re-ignites them. The following stages look like a more straightforward platformer in which the goal is to halt the cigarette production by simply turning off the machinery.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Atlantis Gold", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/n6dMdpXRZVY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148382-nicotine-nightmare\n"}
