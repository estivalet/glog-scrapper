{"altername_name": ["Raider"], "name": "Cavern Fighter", "overview": "Are you willing to plow through six levels of asteroids, alien ships and defense installations, and finally a Dicator's Lair, so as to save the sleepy English town of Watford? If not, you might be better to pass on this Scramble-inspired shoot 'em up. The caverns you fly through have the standard zig-zag walls, which must be avoided. There are no mid-level restart points, and only three lives, which makes things tougher.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "John K.
