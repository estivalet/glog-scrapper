While he is away at the annual Grand Meeting of Sorcerers you stumble across one of his old spell books. Calling Lan, your friend and helper, you decide to try one of the spells. Unfortunately all does not go well. During the spell a demon appears and none of your spells of banishment work. Eventually the demon speaks, 'I curse you weakling.' and with those words he is gone. Mortified you look to Lan for reassurance. Lan gives you the information you require to create the spell needed to banish the demon. You must: a) Find out the demon's name. b) Find the nature of the curse. c) Use the great staff of Zarenol. d) Get the tooth of a dragon. e) Find the Master's secret room.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "M.J.
