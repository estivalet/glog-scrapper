{"altername_name": [], "name": "Yahtzee (Pegasus Software)", "overview": "Yahtzie is a by-the-book early home implementation of the five-dice strategy game often known as Yahtzee. Up to four players can take part, with any number of them being human or CPU. The five dice are displayed from top to bottom on the right of the screen, with a scorecard with each player's scores is on the left. After rolling the five dice, you can see what the current totals would score you, and then choose which dice to roll again - R235 would re-roll the second, third and fifth dice. Each move option has a number next to it, moving down in sequence - S2 scores the second one (twos), S11 the eleventh (a large straight) and so on.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Pegasus Software", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/104074-yahtzee-pegasus-software\n"}
