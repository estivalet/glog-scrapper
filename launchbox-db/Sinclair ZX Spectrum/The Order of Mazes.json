{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Order of Mazes", "overview": "The game is a homage to many of my favourite Spectrum games, incorporating elements of each and adding some new ideas. The basic premise is to navigate your witch or wizard through 4 distinct levels of dastardly Mazes, filled with treasure and monsters, in order to find the 4 lost Emblems of ZedX which will open the exit so you can escape. At the end of the game you received a medal based on your performance in 4 areas: 1) completion time; 2) % of maze explored; 3) # monsters zapped; 4) cash collected. The top medal is platinum. The game features procedurally generated mazes so every game is different. It also has an inbuilt mini-map and checkpoint system to help with playability.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "2015", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tom Dalby", "publishers": "Tom Dalby", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151560-the-order-of-mazes\n"}
