{"altername_name": ["180 (Mikro-Gen)"], "name": "One Hundred and Eighty!", "overview": "One of the earliest darts simulations, the game has nine skill levels. Taking a shot involves two stages: First, players watch a cursor move around the board and press Enter to stop it on the desired number. After this, a small representation of the number's section, complete with double, treble and off-the-board areas, is shown - players press enter again to stop this in the desired place. As in real darts, the single-score area is largest, with higher scores being a smaller area to hit. The 'bust' rule is different to a real game of darts: busting loses a score from one dart, not the whole set of three, although it does end the player's turn. Otherwise, rules are the same as the real game - players toss darts at a board of scores, aiming for a score between 501 to zero, finishing with a double or the Bullseye. Not to be confused with the similar named game from Mastertronic.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Mikro-Gen", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKEtd71VFWA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/102111-one-hundred-and-eighty\n"}
