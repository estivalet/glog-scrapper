{"altername_name": [], "name": "Time Quest", "overview": "It is the year 2997 A.D. As you know world peace has been maintained for over half a millenium due to the foresight of our ancestors. Over 500 years ago the nations of Earth decided to remove all weapons of destrution by hiding them in the corridors of time. It has now become known to us that one man threatens the stability of the world by locating these weapons. Already he has perfected a vehicle capable of travelling within the time corridor and it is feared that he has begun his search. This man is ESMUND MADDISON. A Time Pursuit Vehicle has been developed at our research establishment but as yet has not been fully tested. Your mission is to use the T.P.V. to locate and stop Maddison. Failure will mean the end of civilisation as we know it and your death!", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "B.J.
