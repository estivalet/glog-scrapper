{"altername_name": [], "name": "Heathrow International Air Traffic Control", "overview": "Heathrow International Air Traffic Control faithfully simulates the job of a radar operator at two major international airports: London Heathrow and Schiphol Amsterdam. The objective is to safely land ten aircraft or more within a time limit of 30 minutes. The task is broken down into a number of selectable levels to allow the player to gradually develop his or her skills. The player must radio instructions to approaching planes, keeping them separated and avoiding collisions. If planes get too close, there is a collision risk warning. Too many warnings or actual collisions will fail the level.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Hewson Consultants", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/uD4Nod7nReA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/146680-heathrow-international-air-traffic-control\n"}
