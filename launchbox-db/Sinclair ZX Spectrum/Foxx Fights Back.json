{"altername_name": ["Fox Fights Back"], "name": "Foxx Fights Back", "overview": "Usually, it would be farmers who get sent out of the house by their lady to go off and shoot some potential food. Denton Designs reversed the roles here though, and put you in control of a fox, out for revenge. You'll be foraging both above and below ground, with rabbits and hens on offer to kill, and apples and milk (yes, I know foxes are purely carnivorous) can be collected. All of this must be brought back to the home before to complete each level. All manner of nasties are thrown at you, including eggs (from hens), nuts (from squirrels) and rocks (from badgers)", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Denton Designs", "publishers": "Image Works", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXYJxFRFJhI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/102118-foxx-fights-back\n"}
