{"altername_name": ["She Wampires"], "name": "The Astonishing Adventures of Mr. Weems and the She Vampires", "overview": "In this top-view shooter with similarities to Gauntlet, Mr. Weems has set out to kill the She Vampires in their mansion, which is split into six levels. These include many locked doors for which keys must be found, plus teleporters and secret paths. Weems' main foes are bats and monsters, strategically placed inside coffins, and regenerating when you re-enter a room. Contact with these drains his blood, although fortunately there are replacement vials of this to be found. He is armed with a garlic-firing gun, plus limited numbers of garlic pills, which make enemies avoid him. The first five levels feature the objects required to kill the She Vampires \u2014 a crucifix, large garlic piece, stake, mirror and mallet. Once they are killed, he must make his escape, facing all those bats and monsters again.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "The RamJam Corporation", "publishers": "Alternative Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Astonishing_Adventures_of_Mr._Weems_and_the_She_Vampires", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/EXZIvHejDSU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/144788-the-astonishing-adventures-of-mr-weems-and-the-she-vampires\n"}
