{"altername_name": [], "name": "Wonder Boy", "overview": "WONDER BOY starts off on a long and hazardous journey, his ultimate mission to rescue his girlfriend Tina, kidnapped by the evil KING. KING lives in a faraway place, across seven bizarre and treacherous territories. Each territory is made up of four lands and each land consists of four areas. When you have reached the end of each territory you will have to defeat a mad Ogre to progress to the next level. On your way, jump over various obstacles including boulders and bonfires and kill attacking nasties such as bees, snakes and killer frogs. Whenever you see a giant egg, open it, as it will always have something for you such as a skateboard or a fairy who may protect you for a while. Do not forget to boost your strength and collect bonus points by eating exotic fruit or (not so exotic) junk food.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Activision", "publishers": "Activision", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.6", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonder_Boy_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/54826-wonder-boy\n"}
