{"altername_name": [], "name": "Naanas", "overview": "In Naanas you play as a man who's trying to catch bananas that a naughty monkey is dropping from a canopy, whilst avoiding coconuts which make you lose a life if they hit you. You have 3 different movements in all - left, right and jump (this is needed if you miss a banana, as you lose a life if you slip on it). The game is played on a single screen, and you just have to keep going to see how high a score you can get.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Mikro-Gen", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148338-naanas\n"}
