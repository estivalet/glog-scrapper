{"altername_name": [], "name": "Whizz Kid", "overview": "Whizz Kid is a puzzle game. It is really a computer version of those flat plastic cases containing lettered blocks that may be slid around, always one less than available squares. In Whizz Kid you are presented with three squares containing nine spaces - a total of 27 in all between them. With the 26 letters of the alphabet, that leaves one blank square. The object is to take the randomly soiled letters and move them around to finish with a configuration which takes you correctly through the alphabet arranged A, B, C on the top line of the left hand block, D, E, F on the next and so on, with the black square left between M and N on the middle row of the middle block. Letters are moved by using the cursor keys and 0 to change from block to block. The less moves made, the higher your score, but the game is played against the clock with you setting the limit up to a maximum of nine minutes.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/104129-whizz-kid\n"}
