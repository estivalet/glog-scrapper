{"altername_name": [], "name": "Rad Ramp Racer", "overview": "Players race against the computer or another player in three courses, performing jumps and collecting tokens under two minutes, using either skates or BMX bikes. The action is split horizontally with the skate-wielding player competing in the top-half of the screen, while the bottom-half is occupied by the BMX rider. The player with the highest score wins. Rad Ramp Racer comes with a course designer, letting the player edit any of the three courses and playing them normally.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/115282-rad-ramp-racer\n"}
