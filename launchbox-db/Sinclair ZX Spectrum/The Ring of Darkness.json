{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Ring of Darkness", "overview": "Welcome to The Ring Of Darkness. You are about to enter a strange world of challenges, surprises and satisfying problems. This is a role playing adventure, so your first task will be to create your character. You will be able to choose your character's name and select from several types and skills. Different characters have very different attributes, and your choice will greatly effect the game. For instance, a warrior is strong, a thief may steal more effectively, and an elf is good at casting spells. When the adventure commences you are an insignificant traveller; weak, inexperienced, and alone in a dangerous and unfamiliar land. You know only that you are here to seek your fortune, and that your immediate concern is one of survival. May luck travel your path.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Wintersoft", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/xzk0NM4YP-0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148468-the-ring-of-darkness\n"}
