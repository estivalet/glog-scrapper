{"altername_name": [], "name": "Crusader", "overview": "I don't know what happened. I barely remember any details. I remember my passion for the crusaders. I always liked them. Between romantic and mysterious. I remember that night, precisely, I read the story of one of them. It was a curious story, bordering on legend. He even made sure it was true. (Was it, or should I say is?). It said something about a boy trapped in an enchanted castle and in a time to which he did not belong. It also said something about a time machine. Then I fell asleep: I'm still not sure if this could be true, the fact is that I woke up here, in this castle, dressed as a crusader, surrounded by ghosts and ghosts. I don't want to understand. I am reluctant to understand. Of course, if it were true ... if it were ... I would only have one hope ... the machine ... the time machine.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Genesis Soft", "publishers": "SPE", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/117793-crusader\n"}
