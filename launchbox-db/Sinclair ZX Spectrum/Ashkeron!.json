The quest has to be completed within a time limit. The presentation is mixed in nature, offering text passages accompanied by graphical representations on the top half of the screen. The scenes represent encounter locations as they happen, with no interaction. The parser is simple, and you can input commands to explore and investigate your surroundings while encounters with NPCs are basically dialog sequences, providing hints on your quest.
