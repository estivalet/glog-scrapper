{"altername_name": [], "name": "Subacuatic Deluxe", "overview": "Subacuatic Deluxe is a compilation of Subacuatic (Side A) + Subacuatic Reloaded (Side B) You have to search for the 4 artifacts scattered around the bottom of the sea. Once you have everything, carry them to your boat. That\u2019s your goal. You have to look after your oxygen reserves. Oxygen diminishes if you touch seaweeds or fancy underwater animals. And just being underwater diminishes it as well, but happily at a much slower pace. To recover it you wether go to the surface to breathe or find bubbles. Each bubbles grants you a \u201clife\u201d, this is, 100 extra oxygen units. You start the game with just 100 units and no extra \u201clives\u201d. So you know you have to look for oxygen!", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "2020", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "The Mojon Twins", "publishers": "The Mojon Twins", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151462-subacuatic-deluxe\n"}
