{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tyrant of Athens", "overview": "In Tyrant of Athens the player becomes the ruler of a Greek city-state. The game starts in Athens, Vth century BCE, surrounded by rival Greek cities and the hostile Persian Empire. The gameplay is similar to that of Hammurabi - each year the player must make decisions vital to the survival of the polis: choosing the number of troops to train, warships and merchant ships to built, units of food to export/import (to sustain the population), to how many allies grant the citizenship (yet they may desert or even rebel) - all of the above makes expenses from the treasury. You'll also respond to attacking armies/fleets (whether to fight back or pay them a tribute). The game plays up to 30 turns, but may end earlier if you suffer disasters and defeats.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "MC Lothlorien", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148659-tyrant-of-athens\n"}
