{"altername_name": [], "name": "Green Beret", "overview": "There are four distinct sections of gameplay, taking in a Missile Base, a Harbour, a Bridge, and an enemy Prison Camp. Extra weapons with limited ammunition can be collected along the way, which will make the task a lot easier. The level is divided into 3 horizontal levels, which can be moved between either by jumping or using ladders, and this gives a chance to avoid the more threatening mobs of enemy fighters.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "November 2, 1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Imagine", "publishers": "Erbe Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.14", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush%27n_Attack", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/16882-green-beret\n"}
