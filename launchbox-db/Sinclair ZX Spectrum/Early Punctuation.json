{"altername_name": [], "name": "Early Punctuation", "overview": "The program gives practice in the use of the full stop, comma, question mark and exclamation mark. It contains only brief examples of the use of the marks, being intended as an accompaniment to a lesson rather than as an alternative to one. A list of useful books to give further instruction and practice is given below. There are twenty sentences in the memory, which are selected at random. In completing the sentences, the student has to find the appropriate punctuation mark on the keyboard and press it when the moving figure is over the point in the sentence from which the mark has been omitted. It is unnecessary to operate any shift keys to print the punctuation marks. The student has to complete ten sentences correctly and is then rewarded with a short game. The exercise routine includes moving graphics, sound and the building-up of the picture which will form part of the final game.The program gives a final score and, if the printer is attached, will print a certificate with the student's name.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/102849-early-punctuation\n"}
