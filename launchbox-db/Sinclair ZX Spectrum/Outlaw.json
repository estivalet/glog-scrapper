{"altername_name": [], "name": "Outlaw", "overview": "The player takes the role of a bounty hunter who has to bring four desperadoes to justice. They can be tackled in any order and if all are defeated, a fifth level emerges. The gameplay offers no surprises: shooting masses of enemies until reaching the end of the level. The player can shoot barrels to receive extras, e.g. boots for extra speed or a rifle for a better range. Dynamite destroys every enemy on the screen.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Decroix - Garafalo", "publishers": "Players Premier", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4em4kgMVuc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/105332-outlaw\n"}
