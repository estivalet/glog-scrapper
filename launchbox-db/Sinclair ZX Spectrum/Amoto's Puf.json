{"altername_name": [], "name": "Amoto's Puf", "overview": "Your life was quiet, with your job as a messenger, in your small town. But that tranquility ended for you the day that Rockers panda arrived on the town with their bikes and they did nothing but bother you, maybe because they did not like your appearance, or, who knows, maybe what they disliked was that you rode better than them on a motorcycle. You could not do anything, until you remembered that saying: \"If you can not defeat your enemy, join him.\" And so you sent your request to the head of the group. The answer was affirmative, but yes, you had to go through a tough test that had already passed some of them, as lame Johnny, who lost his leg in the test. You should go through a circuit prepared by them without hitting Larry \u00abKamikaze\u00bb. If you manage to complete it, your problems will end. Luck!!! Objective: Playing with this typical arcade is very simple. You must eliminate all the luminous points of the screen, passing over them with your blue colored motorcycle, trying not to hit the motorcycle that circulates in the opposite direction and that is violet. For this you can change the track and use the accelerator. If you manage to complete the circuit you will receive a bonus on your marker and you can easily get extra life if you manage to collide with the violet bike in a time limit. Of course, here you can not use the accelerator. The game has 20 levels, with fewer doors as you progress level.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Carlos Perez", "publishers": "SPE", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gerUsQ_eUsU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/55595-amotos-puf\n"}
