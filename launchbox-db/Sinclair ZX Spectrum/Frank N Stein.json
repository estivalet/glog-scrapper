This was the advertising blurb. The Setting Professor F. N. Stein's laboratory in his castle in the Black Forest. The Game 50 Screens requiring timing, logic and planning to complete. The Opposition Too many to list here but featuring snails, bats, ice (it makes you slip), fireman's pole, man-eating pumpkins, spiders, slime (it slows you down), caterpillars, tanks, springs, light bulbs (they electrocute you), mice, lobsters, snakes, bumble bees, jack-in-the-box etc. The Object As you know, all the best monsters are hand built. Prof. Stein's life long ambition has always been to build his own monster - but first he needs all the bits! You guide him around the dungeon picking up the bones - make sure you get the right order - then activate him by throwing the switch - the longer you take to complete each screen, the higher will be the charge you give him - and the angrier he will become - so watch out!", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "PSS (Personal Software Services)", "publishers": "PSS (Personal Software Services)", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.11", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/80294-frank-n-stein\n"}
