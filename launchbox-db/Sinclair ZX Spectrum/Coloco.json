{"altername_name": [], "name": "Coloco", "overview": "Complete each level of the game by flying and later landing on the platform with the pilot to be rescued, who will board your ship, and take him back to the station where you leave to consider the rescue successful. Be careful of the dangers you will encounter, and pay attention to your fuel gauge. You will often have to collect the gasoline cans that you will find in some levels, or you will not be able to return to the base. Some pilots have managed to get trapped behind huge doors. You will need to find the key first to be able to open them, and thus access the landing site. The game consists of thirty levels spread over three different worlds. Try to complete them all!", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "2020", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tuxedo Games", "publishers": "Tuxedo Games", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/144729-coloco\n"}
