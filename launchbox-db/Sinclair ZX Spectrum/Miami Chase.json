{"altername_name": [], "name": "Miami Chase", "overview": "Your name is Don Ferrari - tough cop. In the hope of boosting his re-election chances, the Mayor of Miami has set you a task. Aboard a souped-up F40 you have 48 hours to rid the city of 7 most notorious crime lords, by any means necessary. Your objective is to drive around Miami, looking for red cars and shooting them away, within a time limit for each level. Avoid hitting buildings or other cars, and don't shoot too many civilian cars or you are history. If you drive erratically in the vicinity of other cop cars they will stop you, costing valuable time. You can use a map of the city to help you find your targets.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Codemasters", "publishers": "Codemasters", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "0.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/122141-miami-chase\n"}
