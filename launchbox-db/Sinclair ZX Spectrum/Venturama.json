{"altername_name": [], "name": "Venturama", "overview": "Oh dear! In Venturama you play a character called Orson Karte. If that isn\u2019t the worst joke-name in the world, I don\u2019t know what is. (What about Annette Curtain or Teresa Green? Ed) Anyway, this Orson bloke was floating over the island of Rialcnisruoy (think about it) in his balloon when he accidentally fell out. So now he\u2019s trapped there. As Orson, you must find the diamond skull and make your way to the balloon (which crashed elsewhere on the island but, magically, is still in working order) and float gently back to safety. All this makes it sound incredibly easy but, as you\u2019d expect, it isn\u2019t. There are lots of nasty platformy screens to work through, and plenty of tricks and traps. You can carry up to four objects at any time, and most of them have a function. For example, at the start of the game if you collect the magic crystal by the beach-hut and place it on the blue object, it\u2019ll unlock the passage to the right. Then you can really get started.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Graham D.
