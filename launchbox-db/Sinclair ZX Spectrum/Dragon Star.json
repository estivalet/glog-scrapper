{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dragon Star", "overview": "Legends relate a time when the world was not dark and the black dragons were imprisioned in their sinister mountain kingdom. A time when a strange magical crystal hung in the sky placed by a wizard to flood the world with light and banish evil. A time of peace and plenty when it was possible to travel the world without fear. Alas the wizard is no more struck down by a creature conjured from the depths of hell and the crystal is no longer in its place. Snatched by a conspiracy of the foulest dragons hatched in the soiled halts of the great mountain it lies in fragments guarded by the dragons and their spawn. In it's place a giant evil dragon glares malevolently down. No longer do people speak of the crystal star as a symbol of joy. Instead they talk fearfully of the dragonstar and yearn for a brave warrior. Someone who can enter the mountain, collect the fragments of the crystal and return it to it's rightful place. The need for a hero has never been greater and you are the one chosen chosen for this task.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "D.
