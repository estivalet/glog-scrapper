{"altername_name": ["Hombre de Nieve"], "name": "The Snowman", "overview": "The Snowman is based on episodes from Raymond Briggs' book of the same name - a very gentle comic strip story which uses absolutely no words, and conveys the story entirely in its pictures. The game comprises four stages, each with its own screen layout. You have to guide the little boy around a series of ladders, avoiding small flames and sleep monsters. The object is to collect snow and other paraphernalia from which to build a snowman.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "David Shea", "publishers": "Quicksilva", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78697-the-snowman\n"}
