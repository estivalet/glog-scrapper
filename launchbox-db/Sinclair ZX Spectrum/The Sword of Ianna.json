{"altername_name": ["Sword of Ianna"], "name": "The Sword of Ianna", "overview": "Evil is agitated. After centuries of calm, La Paz has abandoned the steppes of Dasht-E Kavir and Dashr-E Lut. Orcs, dark gentlemen and other perverse creatures stalk and attack travelers on the roads, and even dare to approach the least defended towns. It is rumored that the chimneys of the Dal Gurak tower smoke again, and the elderly shamans comment on the news in a low voice, fearful of making the bad omens come true. You are Jarkum, a barbarian from Arram's lineage. Your ancestor Tukaram was chosen by the goddess Ianna to end the darkness caused by Asherat, the Lord of Chaos. Now, all signs make you think about the return of the same evil, although you do not dare to mention it aloud so as not to attract bad luck. However, when an old shaman went to your store, you knew something was wrong. You must leave immediately to Kashgar. Evil does not expect, and you are our only hope. Our people, proud and powerful, have become fearful with the years of peace and will not resist the attack of chaos forces. You must go to Kashgar and follow the advice of your ancestors. 0", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "2017", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "retroworks", "publishers": "Retroworks", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151539-the-sword-of-ianna\n"}
