{"altername_name": [], "name": "Slippery Sid", "overview": "Slippery Sid is another implementation of the Snake genre, sharing very similar gameplay. Sid the snake is the character which the player will control during the game. It is a non-stoppable reptile which has only one focus in mind: to eat all the green frogs present on every screen. To succeed in this task he has to avoid colliding against walls, against his own body and the poisonous toads. Every time a frog is eaten, Sid's body will grow larger and a toad will randomly appear on the screen. One of the main difficulties which defines this genre is to manage the perpetual manoeuvring of a body which is in constant growth, and is constrained on a limited scenario dotted with deadly obstacles. Levels will increasingly become more difficult, as the speed of the game will proportionally increase every time a scenario is completed.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Silversoft", "publishers": "Silversoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ujXJ4To_a-g", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/104582-slippery-sid\n"}
