{"altername_name": [], "name": "Beyond the Ice Palace", "overview": "AIM: Beyond the Ice Palace lies a mystical land caught up in a battle between good and evil. Dark spirits are setting alight the forests, destroying the homes and livelihood of simple woodcutters. In desperation the ancient and wise spirits of the woods shoot a sacred arrow into the air. Whoever finds it will be able to destroy the powers of darkness... GAMEPLAY: Like any other platform game - you run, jump and duck through a horizontally scrolling landscape, avoiding the various creatures and their shots. You can collect various weapons of differing strengths, ranging from a knife to a fireball. They have individual effects on various creatures, some of which need to be shot several times. Two Spirits of the Forest accompany you on your journey. When activated via the keyboard they sacrifice themselves in order to reduce the power of the enemies currently on the screen, weakening some and killing others. Extra spirits and bonus icons, which boost points, are scattered around the land.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Paradise Software", "publishers": "Elite Systems", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.43", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyond_the_Ice_Palace", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/53953-beyond-the-ice-palace\n"}
