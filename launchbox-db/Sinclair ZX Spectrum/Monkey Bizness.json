{"altername_name": ["Monkey Biznes"], "name": "Monkey Bizness", "overview": "Donkey Kong provides the basic gameplay for this platforms-and-ladders game comprising 8 screens. You start at the bottom of each one, and must reach the top to ultimately rescue the princess from the evil ape. The ape throws barrels at you, which roll along the platforms and down the gaps, and kill you on contact. Mallets and umbrellas are dotted around the screen - umbrellas make you safe from falls. Mallets make you safe from contact with barrels - these last a limited amount of time, and stop you from jumping, so waiting near a ladder in case a barrel comes towards you is a major gameplay element. Later levels add extra hazards such as disappearing barrels, gaps in the ladders you must climb, and springs to help you up.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nigel P.
