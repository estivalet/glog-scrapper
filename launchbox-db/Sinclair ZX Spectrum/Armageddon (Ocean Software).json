{"altername_name": [], "name": "Armageddon (Ocean Software)", "overview": "Armageddon is based on the arcade game Missile Command where you are the commander of a Missile Battery and you have to protect six cities in this single screen shooter. Nuclear tracers fall from the top of the screen leaving behind a trail and as you move a cross-hair around the screen, you must fire a limited supply of missiles and allow them to explode in front of each trail to destroy them. If a nuclear tracer hits a city then it is destroyed and if all cities are destroyed then it is game over. A plane occasionally flies over the screen from left to right and you get bonus points for destroying it. Once a wave is over then bonus points are awarded for any cities and missiles left before being re-armed and you then protect the remaining cities from another attack. On the C64, you can choose the wind speed (0-9) before the game starts, with zero being no wind.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ocean Software", "publishers": "Ocean Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.82", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83551-armageddon-ocean-software\n"}
