{"altername_name": [], "name": "Inheritance", "overview": "Great Uncle Arbuthnot is dead. You stand to inherit your great uncle's entire estate, but first you must prove your financial acumen by turning \u00a310,000 into \u00a3100,000 within 26 weeks. The game is split into two parts - the first of which allows you to invest your money in the stock market, metal exchange, casino and the racetrack! You'll have to deal with relatives who will try to trick you or at least divert your attention. When you finally raise the money, you can move to part two. In the second part you have successfully inherited Pooksley Manor and the surrounding estate which includes an ailing soft drinks factory. Your aims are to find the secret formula for a potentially lucrative soft drink, market it, and become a millionaire.
