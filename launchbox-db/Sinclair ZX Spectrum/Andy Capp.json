{"altername_name": [], "name": "Andy Capp", "overview": "It's Monday morning and you're in a flat spin. Flo's demanding your dole cheque. She'll be off to her mother's if she doesn't get it soon. And who'll do the washing-up then? You'll need every ounce of your northern wile and charm to raise the cash to survive, one way or another. Maybe you can extract a quid or two from your friends? Or try your luck on the horses? But whatever you do, steer clear of the rent man and the local copper - they're both after you with a vengeance! Watch your favourite cartoon characters come alive as you duck and dive, dodge and weave you way through a week in the life of Andy Capp.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Blitter Animations", "publishers": "Alternative Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.12", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Capp:_The_Game", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41286Q89qTE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/53946-andy-capp\n"}
