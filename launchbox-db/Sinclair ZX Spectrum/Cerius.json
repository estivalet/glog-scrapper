{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cerius", "overview": "When Rogorf, leader of the Phibiatrons, needs more iron ore, he sets out to capture the human colony Cerius and enslave its people. Armed with an Avenger IV tank (complete with blasters, smart bombs and a limited shield), your mission is to infiltrate his well-guarded lair. Cerius is a flick-screen shoot \u2018em up, characterised by your Avenger unit being unable to jump, needing instead to rely on the arrangement of teleporters in order to navigate Rogorf\u2019s base. Push up to enter these; the same applies for the improved weapons, ammo dumps and energy boosts. Completing the levels requires considerable back-tracking, a fact made more awkward for the player by the fact that the screens reset when you leave them. Each of the three levels contains four Guardian enemies, all of which must be destroyed. This is because they each release a letter, which must be rearranged to form the correct four-letter password for the final door.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atlantis Software", "publishers": "Atlantis Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.12", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/96813-cerius\n"}
