{"altername_name": [], "name": "General Election", "overview": "The object of the game is to win more seats than your opponents in Parliament. Each player chooses a Political Party to lead, and unless otherwise stated, all parties have equal turns of play. To keep the game to a practical size there are only 100 Constituencies (seats). These are split up into five regions. As in real politics, seats are VERY SAFE, SAFE, MARGINAL or VERY MARGINAL. In non-political terms, the very safe seats give an advantage to the owner of the Constituency, as they are harder for other parties to gain. The very marginal seats are much easier for the other parties to gain, although there is still a small built-in advantage to the owner of the seat.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Bug-Byte Software", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/Kcb_FBQcZR8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148100-general-election\n"}
