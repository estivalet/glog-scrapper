Unfortunately, Catheter gets word of your plans, and mixes up a whole new batch of vicious gremlins. As a result, your mission is now one of destruction and avoidance. Elite's implementation of this is a five-level side-view action game, in which you run around avoiding or shooting the gremlins. Each level has a secret object which must be collected. Bonus items such as extra lives and time can be collected, as can improved weapons, and credits to spend on a new weapon after each level.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Topo Soft", "publishers": "Elite Systems", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.62", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gremlins_2:_The_New_Batch_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/114937-gremlins-2-the-new-batch\n"}
