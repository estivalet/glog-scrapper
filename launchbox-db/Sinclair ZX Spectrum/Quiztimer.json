{"altername_name": [], "name": "Quiztimer", "overview": "The game consists of a word supplied with several letters missing, and also a clue. The time taken to answer the questions is also important as this will affect your score. Once the main program has been loaded, the player has to choose a password which is necessary if you want to see answers and clues before starting the game, or if you want to change the questions. The menu gives the following options; load quiz data (from a choice of 10 subjects ranging from Food and Drink to Greek Mythology); single or two player game: alter the time allowance; select pictures or words; view/alter quiz data and create and save new quiz data. The best thing about this program is its flexibility - it has endless potential both for home use and for schools. The game is thoroughly enjoyable to play, and it also provides a useful educational experience, giving at the end a list of all the words you didn't get or that you spelt wrongly. You can also obtain a print-out of what is being shown on the screen, and the whole thing can be transferred to Microdrive if desired", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/125305-quiztimer\n"}
