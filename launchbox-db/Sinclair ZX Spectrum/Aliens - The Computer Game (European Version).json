{"altername_name": ["Aliens: The Computer Game", "Aliens: The Computer Game (European Version)"], "name": "Aliens: The Computer Game (European Version)", "overview": "The player controls six characters from a remote terminal, guiding them through a 255-room complex in search of the Alien Queen. Each character has a helmet camera and a smart gun, each controlled by the player acting in the role of overall operational commander. The player can switch to any character at any time, and must consider coordinating their movements and finding a safe location before switching to the next character. Characters occupy one room at a time, and can pan their view a full 360-degrees inside each room. Doors can be locked to halt Alien progress, or blasted open to get through (at the cost of permanently destroying the door). Alien bio-mass must also be destroyed before it spawns facehuggers, and the Aliens themselves leave lethal puddles of acid when killed (and so shouldn't be killed in front of doors!)", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Focus Creative Enterprises", "publishers": "Electric Dreams Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.45", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliens:_The_Computer_Game_(1987_video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-9wfWzBzY0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/82774-aliens-the-computer-game-european-version\n"}
