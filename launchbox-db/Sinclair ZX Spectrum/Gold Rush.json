{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gold Rush", "overview": "Oron may be an odd planet, but it's home to millions of Oronites! This is your chance to live the life of a goldminer on that planet. It's not quite how you might imagine it. The gold mines of Oron are bottomless caverns with nuggets of the precious yellow metal raining from the roof. The traditional method of collecting the gold is difficult and very dangerous. Suspended between the walls of the pit are two pots to catch the gold. But as these pots cannot be moved, you must place a number of girders across the open spaces of the cavern to deflect the falling nuggets into them. This is tricky enough, but real danger comes from the demons of the mine. They want the gold too and will kill you if they catch you! Goldmining on Oron may seem rather strange to you, but digging for the stuff is even stranger to them!", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Martin Harris", "publishers": "Thorn EMI Video", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148131-gold-rush\n"}
