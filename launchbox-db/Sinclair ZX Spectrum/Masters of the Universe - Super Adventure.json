{"altername_name": ["Masters of the Universe: The Super Adventure"], "name": "Masters of the Universe: Super Adventure", "overview": "This interactive fiction title (one of three licensed Masters of the Universe titles released in the mid 1980s) might suit the more intellectual He-Man fans. Skeletor has developed an Earthquaker device, which uses hypnotic rays to control a horde of Rockbinders - gigantic boulder beasts capable of gnawing through solid rock. As the game starts, the beasts are tunnelling beneath the Shadowlands and approaching Eternia. As Adam AKA He-Man, can you stop Skeletor and his evil plan before it is too late? The game is reasonably easy by adventure standards, and uses a largely two-word parser with commands such as ENLIST, EXAMINE and FIT. Time saving commands include GET ALL and DROP ALL, and BOM (back one move) for undoing mistakes.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Adventure International (UK)", "publishers": "U.S. Gold", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.88", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_of_the_Universe:_The_Super_Adventure", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/55542-masters-of-the-universe-super-adventure\n"}
