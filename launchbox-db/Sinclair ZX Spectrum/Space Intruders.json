{"altername_name": [], "name": "Space Intruders", "overview": "In the pilot seat of his Calurian Cannon Ship, the player finds himself at the Forts of Falnon (massive defense and refueling stations), responding to a mayday message requesting help. However, it appears our hero has arrived too late. No-one remains alive in the Forts and suddenly a warning light strobes on the console alerting him of an incoming battle formation of Alien Intruders. Taking cover behind the defensive Forts, the player must move his Cannon Ship, avoiding the curling cords of deadly energy being fired from the alien attack ships. The only way to stop these aliens is to blast them with bolts of Caluric laser fire. You must stop them here before other more defenseless civilizations succumb to this evil menace from the stars! One of many Space Invaders clones for the ZX Spectrum.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "John Hollis", "publishers": "Quicksilva", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWykSbNBYbc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/104536-space-intruders\n"}
