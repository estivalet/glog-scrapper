Every move you make the aliens will counter in an attempt to prevent you from destroying the weather control station which you must do in order to win the battle. You will need to plan a precise tactical campaign and be on your guard at all times - the aliens are waiting for you to make just one slip up, and you certainly won't get any second chances! You have various military units under your control and also radar and explosive units. Use these carefully as the aliens have their equivalents which will soon be revealed. If you can manage to destroy all the aliens units and escape in their space craft all the better, and all the more points for you.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Bulldog Software", "publishers": "Bulldog Software", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/122839-invasion\n"}
