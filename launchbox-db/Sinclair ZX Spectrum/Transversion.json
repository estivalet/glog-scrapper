{"altername_name": [], "name": "Transversion", "overview": "Transversion is simple yet fast-paced puzzle game. The story places the player in control of the space ship Elimax. The players mission is to seek out and destroy alien egg pods on the galactic grid. which is accomplished by flying their ship around the grid and over the alien pods leaving their Raydon field to destroy them. There's no shooting in this game, at least the player does not do any shooting, the aliens who patrol the edges of the grid do lots and lots of shooting. All shots travel along the lines of the grid, so a player who either stays still or travels in a straight line for too long is an easy target. The player starts with five lives and scores points are scored for each pod destroyed. When a life is lost the player restarts the level with all pods back in place on the grid. The game records the highest score of the gaming session and plays \"Congratulations\" when a new high score has been set.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ocean Software", "publishers": "Ocean Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/102865-transversion\n"}
