{"altername_name": [], "name": "Chrimblast!", "overview": "Chrimblast! isn't a very big game, coming in at only 8 levels, but what there is on offer is still a fun game to play to pass the time. It's also simplistic in design with asteroids and enemies appearing from the top that must either be avoided or blasted out of the way. But what I did really like about the game was being able to collect presents, listening to that voice over announcement and powering up the blaster to that of a much bigger beam, kind of like R-Type.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "2015", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Stonechat Productions", "publishers": "Stonechat Productions", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/144707-chrimblast\n"}
