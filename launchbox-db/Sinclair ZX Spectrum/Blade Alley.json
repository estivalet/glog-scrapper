{"altername_name": ["3D-Ravijn"], "name": "Blade Alley", "overview": "Climb into your ion-driven interceptor and steel your nerves for the confrontation to come. Swooping low into the defensive trench, you nudge your gun-sights onto the alien craft hurtling towards you. Trigger the photon disruptors and let out a sigh of relief as the saucer vanishes in a cloud of vapor; but don't relax, there's much more to come ... This game feels very much inspired by the game Buck Rogers, with some sprinkles of Star Wars on top. It's a semi 3D shooter, where you fly down down a trench, over a landscape, through a tunnel or through space and blast four different enemy types. It's all pretty simple and has only got six different stages. The game is also know under the name 3D-Ravijn.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "PSS (Personal Software Services)", "publishers": "PSS (Personal Software Services)", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.58", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fumV6mjuE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/112909-blade-alley\n"}
