{"altername_name": [], "name": "Manic Miner 3: Tales from a Parallel Universe", "overview": "It is rumoured that there are an infinite number of parallel universes where every possibility is played out. Things in these other dimensions may be very similar to our own reality, but subtly different because of certain decisions which were taken differently. Miner Willy is no exception to this rule. Previously, thousands of Speccy owners had thrilled to his adventures in his battle to escape the Manic Mining machines, but now Cheese Freak Software brings you the escapades of ANOTHER Miner Willy from a parallel universe! Just like his counterpart in this reality, Willy has fallen into a mine packed with dangers and must escape from 20 lethal caverns in order to locate the untold treasures of an ancient civilisation. However, in this universe things are subtly different..... Can Miner Willy emulate the antics of his trans-dimensional counterpart, or are the Speccy owners of the other universe doomed to a life with no Jet Set Willy?", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Cheese Freak Software", "publishers": "", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BLI_hCBueg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165224-manic-miner-3-tales-from-a-parallel-universe\n"}
