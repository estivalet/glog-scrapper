{"altername_name": [], "name": "Wender Bender", "overview": "Most people are probably familiar with this sort of game. The main display shows a block of 25 Ws arranged 5 by 5. Each node has a letter in it and the questions are based around that letter. For example a player asking for the block with letter R may get 'What R is a contest of speed ': answer 'Race'. Not all of the questions are as easy as that, in fact the quiz is a good test not only of general knowledge but of spelling as well since the answers must be spelt correctly when they are input. At the start of the game you can select a two-player game or one player can pit wits with the computer. The colour selected by a player dictates whether he or she tries to form a line of Ws from top to bottom of the screen, or from left to right. For every correct answer you give the associated node turns into the colour of your side. Whoever answered the last question correctly will get first call on the next. Since the object of the game is to try and form a bridge of nodes between the two sides one would normally pick letters that are adjacent to each other but you could block your opponent instead. The computer keeps a score for both players and allows a game for as many matches as you please.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/104136-wender-bender\n"}
