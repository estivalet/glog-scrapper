{"altername_name": [], "name": "Startrek", "overview": "As a captain of SS Enterprise the player must defeat all the Klingon warships in the current quadrant in a designated time to save the empire. The ship is armed with phasers (energy weapon) and photon torpedoes (very limited, never miss the target). The player may use long and short range scanners. Using the shields requires diverting some energy level. Reaching the Starbase allows to refuel and rearm the ship plus replenish the energy cells. Most command activities drain the energy level. The impulse drive allows avoiding a collision with a star or Klingon's ship. Commands are given by pressing a certain key. If the ship run out of the energy or the mission is not completed in the designated time the mission fails.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Chromasoft", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/167005-startrek\n"}
