{"altername_name": [], "name": "Jaws Revenge", "overview": "This is a game for hungry people. You're a shark on a jaws-agape- feeding-frenzy. Fish, swimmers (moving at Olympic speeds) and boatmen all go down your throat. Some fish have a habit of turning red and poisonous, so don't eat those, and the fishermen in their boats throw harpoons or drop depth charges to stun you. You can catch the depth charges and defuse them before they reach the seabed. And the sea bed itself isn't flat so don't run into it. It's a sort of Penetrator meets Galaxians under water. An amusing game with good graphics.
