{"altername_name": [], "name": "Super Trolley", "overview": "Super Trolley recreates all the fun of shelf-stacking as a computer game. Your task is to keep the shelves stocked and the floors clean. First up you must collect the stock to be placed on the shelves, then move it to the appropriate part of the supermarket. Over 30 foods are featured, ranging from bread and milk to eggs and carrots. Each section of the supermarket has its own isometrically-viewed screen. The shoppers are there to get in your way, and other hazards include vandalising kids, un-house-trained dogs and moronic shoppers who don't take their item off the top of the shelves. The ultimate aim of the game is to do so well that you can take over as manager.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Icon Design", "publishers": "Dro Soft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Trolley", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG8J5yIHAUc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/102943-super-trolley\n"}
