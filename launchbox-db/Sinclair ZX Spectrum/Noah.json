{"altername_name": ["The Ark"], "name": "Noah", "overview": "It is three days brefore the flood. 62 animals are hidden within the 256 screens of this game, in a different location every time. Your task as Noah is to find the animals and bring them back to the ark. Not all are willing to go, some you will have to drag by the tail. You have six lives, but only three days. To add to the difficulty, Noah is not very popular with his tales of doom, so watch out for restive locals who will throw stones if you get too close. For each pair of animals saved, see how history changes!", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "ESP", "publishers": "ESP", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/371707-noah\n"}
