You have to move your Quadroid over a maze of platforms while avoiding nasties that move about each screen and if you touch one then you lose one of three lives. As you move about the screen there are also various platforms to be wary of like platforms that disappear when moved across, platforms that turn on and off, and platforms that send you in a certain direction. If you fall of a platform you also lose a live and when all lives are lost then it is game over.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "The Big Apple", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165226-oops\n"}
