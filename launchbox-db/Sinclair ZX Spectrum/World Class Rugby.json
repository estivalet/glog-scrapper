{"altername_name": [], "name": "World Class Rugby", "overview": "Like Domark's Rugby: The World Cup, World Class Rugby was released alongside the 1991 Rugby World Cup, which was won by New Zealand in a final against England. Recreating this full 16-team event is an option, as are individual friendly matches and an 8-team league. Options are highly customisable - there are 10 skill levels, variable match lengths, the option to play without offsides, and variable pitch conditions. Replays can be enabled for each try, and then saved to disk. The accurate rules of rugby are recreated, including scrums, line-outs, penalties and drop goals.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/104104-world-class-rugby\n"}
