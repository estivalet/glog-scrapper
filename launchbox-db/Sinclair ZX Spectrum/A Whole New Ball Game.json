{"altername_name": [], "name": "A Whole New Ball Game", "overview": "Originally published in Crash - within the magazine cover tape \"Crash issue 66: Presents 2\". The game is a puzzle arcade game and will be loved by anyone whose brain exceeds their brawn. All the instructions and information you could possibly want are onscreen, but here's a brief summary of the game... The object is to capture yellow energy pills by rolling a ball over them. The ball heads off around the screen under its own power and you can only control the ball's path by placing and removing gates to deflect its course by 90 degrees. Each screen must be cleared of energy pills before the time limit expires. Watch out for other objects called effectors which may speed up the ball, change its path or generally muck it about. The notion is very easy to grasp, but playing Ball Game is a different matter. You should be able to clear the first few screens on easy level, after just a few goes... but it gets harder!", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "July 3, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Pete Cooke", "publishers": "Crash", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/AxmIvDoetEI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/157945-a-whole-new-ball-game\n"}
