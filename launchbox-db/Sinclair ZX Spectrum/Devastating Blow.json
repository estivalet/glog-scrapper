{"altername_name": [], "name": "Devastating Blow", "overview": "This is a boxing game featuring Mike Tyson on the front cover. The player takes the role of an up-and-coming boxer who has won 20 fights so far against 'nobody' opponents. Now it's time to move up and take on the big boys. Like other boxing games, it's a bit of a button masher but you've got to get your combinations right to get through the opponent's guard. One side of the tape has a one player game, the other side has a two player game.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Beyond Belief", "publishers": "Beyond Belief", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Etn2sEFyrbs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/118392-devastating-blow\n"}
