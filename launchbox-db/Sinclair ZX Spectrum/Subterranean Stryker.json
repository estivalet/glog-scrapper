{"altername_name": [], "name": "Subterranean Stryker", "overview": "Your Mission Objective: Descend through the alien cave systems to the enemy fortress destroying alien guards and rescuing the captive humans. On your way you will encounter many indigenous hazards, which must be avoided at all costs. Your craft is protected from minor collisions by an invisible energy shield, this will not, however, protect you from more serious collisions with enemy plasma bombs etc., so... exorcise extreme caution!!!!!(sic). On each of the lower levels is an enemt fuel dump. You can steal fuel and energy from these by simply flying up to the nozzle. When you have rescued all eight men from each level the energy gate will disappear enabling you to descend to the next target. Should you delay too long on any level the alien command saucer will lock on to your position and attempt to ram you.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mike Follin", "publishers": "Insight Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aejPxAr0GCY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/95403-subterranean-stryker\n"}
