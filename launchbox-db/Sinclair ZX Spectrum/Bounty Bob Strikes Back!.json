{"altername_name": ["Bounty Bob Strikes Back"], "name": "Bounty Bob Strikes Back!", "overview": "Bounty Bob Strikes Back! is the sequel to Miner 2049er and was initially released in 1984 for the Atari 8-bit family. The game added a pseudo-3D look to the platforms and increased the level count from 10 to 25. It was ported to the ZX Spectrum in 1985. Gameplay is similar to Miner 2049er in that the player must inspect every section of 25 mines while avoiding mutants within a set time. One difference is that after losing a life, sections on platforms remain covered and destroyed enemies do not reappear, making it easier to complete a level.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "U.S. Gold", "publishers": "Americana Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounty_Bob_Strikes_Back!", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78472-bounty-bob-strikes-back\n"}
