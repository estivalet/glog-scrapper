{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ground Force Zero", "overview": "Ground Force Zero is a Blitz-style game where the player controls a plane that is low on fuel as it approaches a built-up city that is generated randomly for each game. To avoid disaster the player must destroy the buildings below them, which are of different heights. This is done by pressing the 'b' key as the plane passes over a building, releasing a bomb and destroying the top few levels of a building. If the plane is on the same level as a standing piece of building, it will crash, meaning Game Over. There are 10 skill levels, with the higher numbers generating taller buildings and thus reducing the margin for missing the taller ones first.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Titan Programs", "publishers": "Titan Programs", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/145527-ground-force-zero\n"}
