{"altername_name": [], "name": "Vanquisher", "overview": "The tracks of VANQUISHER JUNCTION are marked as lines on the diagram, of the shunting yards. Spare places for carriages, are marked with empty boxes, and the carriages themselves are marked by letters. You must move each letter from the main overnight siding, via the tracks, to the siding at the top of the diagram. This is achieved by inputting to the prompt at the bottom of the diagram the letter you wish to move. Then to the next prompt, the direction you wish it to move. If you want to move the same letter more than once, continue entering the direction only. You need only input a letter when you wish to move a different letter to the one shown in the box marked 'moving'. You will find that the letters or carriages do not move instantly, this is because the shunting engine has to couple up to the carriage you have chosen, so changing the carriage you are moving too will often give you a bad score at the end. Furthermore, you may give up at any time, by pressing \"?\" but you will lose your status as a Station Master. You will be timed during the course of the task by the clock in the top right of the diagram, after one hour it will restart from zero. Good luck.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Elephant Software", "publishers": "Elephant Software", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/104595-vanquisher\n"}
