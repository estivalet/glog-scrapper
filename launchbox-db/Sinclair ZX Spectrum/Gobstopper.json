{"altername_name": ["Gob Stopper"], "name": "Gobstopper", "overview": "Gob Stopper is an original arcade game which challenges you to aid Spodgo in his fight for survival in a world gone crazy. Your reflexes will decide if he can annihilate marauding, killer gob-stoppers and avoid their defenders. Should Spodgo survive with your aid then you must assist him to pass through the trains whilst avoiding the gates to get to the third stage where he must survive a deadly onslaught of Flying Ice Cream cones. You don't have unlimited time because the longer you take the faster your opposition becomes so you'd better move - Spodgo needs you!", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Walltone Software", "publishers": "Calisto", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/bK6RAuY5EC8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148123-gobstopper\n"}
