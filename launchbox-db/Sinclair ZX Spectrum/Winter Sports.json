{"altername_name": [], "name": "Winter Sports", "overview": "Eight winter sports events are recreated in this Epyx-style action game. Three variations on skiing are included - Downhill, Slalom and Giant Slalom, which involve setting the correct speed and direction change as you steam through the gates. These events have a split-screen view displaying different angles at once, as to the Bobsled, Speed Skating, Bobsled and Biathlon (all bar the latter are vertically-split). As it includes target shooting, the Biathlon is one of the more challenging events. The game also includes an Ice Hockey mode as something of a bonus. 1. DOWNHILL 2. SLALOM 3. GIANT SLALOM 4.
