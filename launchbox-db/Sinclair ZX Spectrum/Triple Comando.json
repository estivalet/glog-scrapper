{"altername_name": [], "name": "Triple Comando", "overview": "A South American government, after long negotiations and extensive espionage activity, has managed to acquire the Positronic, a large-scale photonic cannon and one of the most powerful weapons the world has ever seen. The Positronic, coveted by many other countries, threatens the already tense peace in the area and has resulted in tensions escalating. The only solution is a covert mission to destroy the Positronic at any cost and for this mission Charlie Montini - a Vietnam veteran with years of combat experience has been selected as the man to lead the charge. Although a weapons expert and fierce fighter on his own merits, he'll be joined by both Humphrey Stallone and Billy Von Pettet - equally adept warriors with lots of jungle combat experience to assist in the extremely risky mission. Together this unit, Codename: Triple Comando, will return to the jungle and rid the world of this fearsome cannon, before it's too late.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Xortrapa Soft", "publishers": "Dro Soft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "3", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148647-triple-comando\n"}
