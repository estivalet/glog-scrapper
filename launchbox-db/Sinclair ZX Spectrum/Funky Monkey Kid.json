{"altername_name": [], "name": "Funky Monkey Kid", "overview": "Play as Funky Monkey Kid to try and free Funky Kung from the Baddie by collecting 4 keys in a row to unlock the cage. (From experience, it is easier to use the M key for jumping on real NEXT hardware) Move left to right and jump up to hold onto vines. You can only hold onto single vines for about 5 seconds but you can hold onto the double vines indefinately. Jump into the air to jump over the crocs, but beware of the birds. You can not move past a croc or bird so must navigate around them. Jump for the plum to knock it loose to kill crocs and birds underneath you.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "2020", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bootlegger", "publishers": "Bootlegger", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147362-funky-monkey-kid\n"}
