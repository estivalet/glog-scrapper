{"altername_name": [], "name": "Menace", "overview": "Menace takes place in the classroom and you are the class menace. There are six desks for pupils and one for the teacher at the top. Once the teacher turns his back on the class, the children start running about the classroom and you have to avoid them while collecting items from the cupboard in the back of the room and placing them in the correct position. Only one item can be carried at any given time, banana skins, whoopee cushions and drawing pins have to be placed in the teacher's chair while catapults can be put on the other children's desk to get them in trouble. The teacher's pet will occasionally put an apple on the teacher's desk, it can be spoilt by putting a nasty grub in it for extra points. On later levels the school cat appears to make your pranks even more difficult.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "David W.
