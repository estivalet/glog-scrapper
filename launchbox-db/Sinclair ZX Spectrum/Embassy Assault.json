{"altername_name": ["Embassy Siege"], "name": "Embassy Assault", "overview": "The main goal and the story of this game is simple: the player starts inside an embassy, has to find its code room, steal its confidential secret codes and leave. The scenario simulates a three-dimensional environment and is randomly generated in a maze format. The ability to achieve the game's goal with the lowest amount of time is proportionate to the best scoring. The difficulty element is defined by the user in a scale of 1 to 9, influencing the size of the randomly generated maze and the easiness to find the code room and the exit.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "ICL", "publishers": "Sinclair Research Ltd", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/119303-embassy-assault\n"}
