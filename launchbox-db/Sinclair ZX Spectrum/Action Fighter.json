{"altername_name": [], "name": "Action Fighter", "overview": "You have been charged with five highly dangerous missions to destroy the enemies attack force. Combat takes place in enemy territory on the ground and in the air. For this purpose you will make use of the latest top secret transforming vehicle. You begin as a motorcycle. You may then collect four parts (represented by A B C D icons) which will change the motorcycle into a car. The icons will appear depending on the number of enemy vehicles you have destroyed. When you change into the car, pressing the SPACEBAR will transform you back into the motorcycle and vice versa. Changing into the jet-car is done automatically after collecting the last two parts (E and F icons). The jet-car will only change into the motorcycle when landing after completing the mission. This also results in the loss of all parts collected.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Core Design", "publishers": "Firebird Software", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_Fighter", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tChPnKkLEIE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/55589-action-fighter\n"}
