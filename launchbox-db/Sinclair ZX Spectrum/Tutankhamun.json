{"altername_name": ["Tutankhamun"], "name": "Tutankhamun", "overview": "The explorer moves around the tomb scoring points by collecting the treasures and shooting the creatures. Bonus points are awarded for completing the tomb in less time. The explorer can use the tunnels which connect the top and bottom of the screen, when the explorer reaches the edge of the screen the tomb scrolls to the left or the right. Each bomb contains 1 - 4 doors which must be unlocked with the keys that are found in the tomb. Each key will open one door only, you may carry only one key at a time. To kill the creatures that appear in the tomb use either: SMART BOMB this kills all the creatures on the screen, you only have one smart bomb per tomb or life. LAZER this fires alternately to the left of the right, so watch out for the vertical tunnels. The explorer must reach the far right of the tomb before his time is run out. The control panel indicates: map of the tomb, number of lives, wether the exlorer has a key or a smart bomb, time remaining, score and top score.
