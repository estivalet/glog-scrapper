{"altername_name": [], "name": "Frogger", "overview": "Frogger is a variant of the arcade game of the same name. The basic premise is to guide frogs to safety by climbing a 3rd person viewed screen within a time limit, first by crossing a busy road avoiding contact with traffic, then by crossing a river without making contact with the water, then by safely reaching one of the homecells at the top of the screen. Alternating lanes of traffic move in opposite directions and at varying speeds, and the river flow sees alternate 'lanes' of logs and crocodiles (avoid the heads!) moving in opposite directions. Another additional challenge is that each homecell can only be used once - emptying an occupied one costs you a life - once all have been filled a bonus is awarded and all are cleared, In this variant there is also a short maze to clear between the road and river, hitting any of the edges of these also kills your frog. There are stationary lanes of traffic at each end.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Microbyte Software", "publishers": "Rabbit Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78853-frogger\n"}
