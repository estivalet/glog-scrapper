{"altername_name": [], "name": "Paperboy", "overview": "You are the Paperboy and must deliver the newspaper to your customers on a daily basis. Being set in the USA, this entails riding your bike down a different street every day, throwing newspapers into the mailboxes or onto the doorsteps of your subscribers. If a person doesn't get his paper, he'll cancel his subscription - and no subscriptions means no job! Papers can be handy for other things though.... There are various obstacles in your way which will try to knock you off you bike. A well-aimed newspaper makes a handy weapon against these hazards! Also, there's no harm in encouraging people who don't subscribe to your paper to think again about their decision - whack a few papers through their windows for extra points! And while you're at it, why not aim a few at their bird tables and dustbins? Or ride your bike over their flower beds? Mind you don't run out of papers though! You can only carry ten at a time, but supplies are left at various points along your route for you to pick up. You are given a number of lives to complete as many days as possible. You lose a life if anything knocks you off your bike, but the game will end immediately should you run out of subscribers! Get to the end of the day and you can complete an assault course for extra points!", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Elite Systems", "publishers": "Elite Systems", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.83", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paperboy_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/57681-paperboy\n"}
