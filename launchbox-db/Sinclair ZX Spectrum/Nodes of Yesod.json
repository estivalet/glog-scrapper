{"altername_name": [], "name": "Nodes of Yesod", "overview": "Nodes of Yesod is a video game developed and published by Odin Computer Graphics in 1985. The game is similar to Underwurlde, which was released a year earlier. The game was released for the Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, Elan Enterprise 64 and 128 and ZX Spectrum platforms. Versions were also planned for the BBC Micro and MSX platforms but these were cancelled. On the ZX Spectrum, the game came in separate 48K and 128K versions. The latter had improved title-screen music, in-game music and additional synthesised speech. A sequel, The Arc of Yesod, was also published the same year. A \"25th Anniversary Edition\" was released in 2010 for the iPhone and iOS (Apple) devices. This version included a \"classic mode\" (very similar to the original ZX Spectrum version) and an \"enhanced mode\", which featured new colour graphics, help system, map system, save/resume game feature and remixed music.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Colin Grunes", "publishers": "Odin Computer Graphics", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.55", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodes_of_Yesod", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/52410-nodes-of-yesod\n"}
