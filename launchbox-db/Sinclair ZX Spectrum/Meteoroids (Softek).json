{"altername_name": [], "name": "Meteoroids (Softek)", "overview": "Meteoroids is a clone of Asteroids. Having done a hyper jump too close to neutron star, you appear in the middle of an area filled with space debris. The player controls a spacecraft in the middle of an asteroid field and can destroy the asteroids by shooting at them for score. When shot the asteroids will break up into smaller fragments. There are three increasingly smaller sizes of asteroids where the smallest are destroyed if hit. The game is single screen and new asteroids appear perpetually. Occasionally an alien craft appears moving across the screen which can be destroyed for extra points. Bullets are fired in a burst of four, you can rotate your ship 360 degrees as well as thrust forward. There is also an hyperspace option that if invoked randomly shifts you to a new location on the screen to avoid being hit by an incoming asteroid. One feature not found in the original is that you have shields that can be activated before impact to avoid life loss. If you are hit by an asteroid or the alien ship you lose a life.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Andrew J.
