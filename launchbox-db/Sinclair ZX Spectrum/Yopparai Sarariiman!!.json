{"altername_name": [], "name": "Yopparai Sarariiman!!", "overview": "Tokyo, 1980. After an epic party night with his boss at Kabukicho, a dazed Ichikawa-san wakes up at dawn lying on the street. There are no trains and he must return home quickly, by walking or taking some taxis. Grumpy sumo fighters, runaway clocks, crazy traffic lights and poisonous fugu fishes come in his way, trying to stop him. On his way home, he must drink as much sake as he can, and must call his wife on each telephone booth available around the city (so she will wait patiently to his arrival). He must return home with at least a delicious piece of sushi for her! There are lots of typical Japanese restaurants and shops around the city. Will he manage to arrive home?", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "July 9, 2021", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Furillo Productions", "publishers": "Furillo Productions", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "0.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/152970-yopparai-sarariiman\n"}
