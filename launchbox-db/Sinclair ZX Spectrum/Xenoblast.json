{"altername_name": [], "name": "Xenoblast", "overview": "200 years into the future humans have peacefully colonised deep space. Things have taken a dark turn as recent xeno discoveries have turned hostile. News reaches HQ alien life forms have overtaken several human colonies in the outer region, and you are amongst the best pilots to repel their offensive. Xenoblast puts you charge of a class 2 defence ship, an agile fighter with the weaponry to take on the hostile aliens. Guide your ship safely through the colonies, destroying as many xeno fighters as possible, and remove the motherships delivering alien drones to the human colonies. Along the way make sure you collect as many Power Pods as possible. These will recharge your smart bomb, but more importantly enable the portal to hyper jump to the next zone at the end of the level. Take on hoards of alien ships through 7 levels of arcade shoot-em-up action and liberate the colonies before it's too late!
