{"altername_name": [], "name": "Corruption (Omega Software)", "overview": "In the skyscraper world of the future a mutant strain is beginning to infect the fabric of civilisation. A lone figure fights to stop the infection spreading. As a lone figure you must stop the infection of your skyscraper being spread by Mutant Forms by strategically making holes in the super-structure of the building with your bombs. Having made a hole you must lure one of the Mutants towards you so that it falls to its death. Just leaving one alive will soon cause total infection of the building, causing it to rapidly decay. Time is short as the air too is becoming unclean; fresh oxygen is running low so speed is of the essence.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Omega Software", "publishers": "Omega Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/105063-corruption-omega-software\n"}
