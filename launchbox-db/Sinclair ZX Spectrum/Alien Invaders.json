{"altername_name": [], "name": "Alien Invaders", "overview": "London is in peril! An Interplanetary Battle Fleet from Mars - whose inhabitants are infuriated by our claims that their planet is dead - has attacked. The Ministry of Defense is asleep, so you have to defend the city with just one missile launcher. You can move the launcher to the left using capital Z and to the right using X. Press F when you are ready to fire. The Aliens descend cautiously at first, but be on your guard. If you let a single ship through, London will be devastated.During the game you score points for each invaders you hit - more points for a ship high in the sky than for one close to the ground.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Patricia Grady", "publishers": "Grisewood & Dempsey", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/163357-alien-invaders\n"}
