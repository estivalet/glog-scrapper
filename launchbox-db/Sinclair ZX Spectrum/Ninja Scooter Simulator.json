{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ninja Scooter Simulator", "overview": "Use your scooter to roar through these mean streets within a tough time limit, in a side-scrolling Metrocross-style game. Barriers, rough ground and ramps are in the way, as are other scooter riders from level 3 onwards. You will have to swerve or jump around them. Using jumps requires positioning and timing your landing successfully so as not to fall. The action is side-scrolling, with 5 different positions on the screen featuring a variety of clear spaces and hazards. Time bonuses and speed boosts are available.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Sysoft", "publishers": "Silverbird Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/102719-ninja-scooter-simulator\n"}
