{"altername_name": ["Speed King 2"], "name": "Speed King 2", "overview": "This is a motorcycle racing game viewed from behind the bike. In the one-player game you start behind the 19 other bikes, while the split-screen 2-player game is a simple head-to-head. Gears are automatic, and the bike reaches almost 200km/h. Running off the track causes a gradual loss of speed, while hitting other bikes can cause your speed to drop to zero. Circuits featured are modeled on real tracks including Brands Hatch, Monza and Daytona. You can set the number of laps.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mastertronic Ltd.", "publishers": "Mastertronic", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113349-speed-king-2\n"}
