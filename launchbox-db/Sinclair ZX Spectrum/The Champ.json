{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Champ", "overview": "Take your boxer to the top in this action boxing game. You start off fighting in an alleyway before finding a manager, who will guide you to the training arena. Here you must work on the punch bag, sparring and skipping rope. Eventually you will move up from small fights to the title contests. The 11 moves include high and low punches, as well as defensive moves and escapes. Full knockout rules apply, and the fighters automatically break up grappling situations.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Pantheon Software", "publishers": "Linel", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/117741-the-champ\n"}
