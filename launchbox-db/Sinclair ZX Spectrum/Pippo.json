{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pippo", "overview": "This single-screen top-down action puzzler stars Pippo, a cute creature who must change the colour of each square on a screen. There are 32 levels \u2013 the concept is that the number of times a square must be stepped on to change it to the right colour starts at one and increases every four levels, but there\u2019s a bug in the game meaning that odd-numbered levels always need one change, and even-numbered levels always need two. The levels are on 6x4 grids, although these include lots of holes, which Pippo must avoid. There are also many nasties patrolling the area \u2013 some kill him, while others reset any previous colour changes but can be killed on contact (The Bobby Yazz Show has a similar design on this element). Pacman-style power pills temporarily change enemies into harmless springs. The game features a lot of technical effects and hardware tricks, including full-screen numbers using the normally-blank border.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Giovanni Zanetti", "publishers": "Dro Soft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oN5gR3ehr5E", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/105330-pippo\n"}
