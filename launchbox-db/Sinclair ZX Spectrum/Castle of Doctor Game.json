Some of the rooms he has made to look like the games he has already collected, so be prepared as you venture inside.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "2020", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Paul Jenkinson", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/152914-castle-of-doctor-game\n"}
