{"altername_name": [], "name": "Robots Rumble", "overview": "Guide the broken robots on each planet to their final resting place in the lava pit, with the help of two large magnets. Avoid the green stones of kryptonite, as well as the sentinels of the plant. The magnets have a limited battery charge, but may be charged by picking up the batteries lying around. If you run out of energy, you die, and if both magnets are aligned with the robot, it will stop moving.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "September 21, 2018", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "", "developers": "Miguel \u00c1ngel Tejedor L\u00f3pez", "publishers": "Miguetelo", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mvc8EHZxv4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/158124-robots-rumble\n"}
