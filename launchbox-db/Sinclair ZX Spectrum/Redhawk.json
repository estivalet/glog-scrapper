{"altername_name": [], "name": "Redhawk", "overview": "By shouting 'Kwah!' ordinary Kevin Oliver can transform himself into superhero Redhawk, a power you must use in this cartoon adventure. As you travel the city you must pay attention to your popularity ratings - you can play the game either to perform good or evil. The game uses a text parser with a vocabulary allowing for actions such as walking, looking around, arresting people, hitting them, using objects, or waiting in a set position for a set amount of time - every action sees time get used up. Standard input methods such as using AND or commas to delimit multiple commands, and leaving out words like THE and SOME are implemented. Being in Redhawk mode uses up energy, so this must be used sparingly.The screen display is in comic book style, with the last 3 drawings on screen at each time.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Silhouette Software", "publishers": "Melbourne House", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/83634-redhawk\n"}
