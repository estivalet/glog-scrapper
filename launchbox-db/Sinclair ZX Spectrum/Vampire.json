{"altername_name": ["Phantomas 2"], "name": "Vampire", "overview": "Your mission is scary. You must destroy the evil Count Dracula that ravages the region. Through 95 gruesome rooms you will be besieged by Dracula's slaves, try to avoid being caught and get as much food. If you collect the 5 keys and enter them in their 5 corresponding locks you will have carried out a very important part of your mission. To get each key you must find a certain object and fix it to the \"pedal generator\", if you do so you can jump the huge pit. The second part of your mission is to open the 6 magical shutters by pressing the appropriate switches. Finally look for the hammer and the stake and walk quickly to the top of the castle to pick up the cross. At this moment you will be teleported to the space to fight the final confrontation in which you will be able to use the laser weapon and the self-propelled backpack.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Emilio Pablo Salgueiro Torrado", "publishers": "Codemasters", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.44", "wikipedia": "https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantomas_2", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72159-vampire\n"}
