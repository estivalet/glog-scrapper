{"altername_name": [], "name": "Adidas Championship Football", "overview": "Adidas Championship Football is a soccer game with 24 national teams. The only playing mode is a championship which mimics the World Cup with randomly drawn groups. A second player can control a second team. The playing perspective is top-down with a scrolling field. The control method is an expanded dribbling method known from the Kick Off series. To make a shot, the player needs to hold down the button for a certain amount of time (this determines the power of the shot) and only then play the ball. The angle can be changed by tapping the button.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ocean Software", "publishers": "Erbe Software", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.79", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adidas_Championship_Football", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtbQTz-1PT4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/102119-adidas-championship-football\n"}
