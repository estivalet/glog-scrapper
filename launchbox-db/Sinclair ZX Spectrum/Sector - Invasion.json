{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sector: Invasion", "overview": "Sector: Invasion is a sci-fi shooting game which combines features of the arcade games Space Invaders and Arkanoid.

These ships are indestructible, so the main goal is to destroying the necessary cells on the screen just like in Arkanoid - with the exception of not using a ball for that purpose, but firepower.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "2014", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "RetroSouls", "publishers": "RetroSouls", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151156-sector-invasion\n"}
