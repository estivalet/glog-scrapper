{"altername_name": [], "name": "Evolution", "overview": "Imagine standing on the earth as it was 3500 million years ago. Around you volcanoes are erupting. Lightning flashes across a crimson sky, and the sun, hotter than in the hottest deserts of today, beats down relentlessy. There is no oxygen to breathe, and if you did take off your face mask for a moment, your nostrils would be filled with the pungent smell of ammonia. But from such an unpromising start the chain of events that led through the first plants and animals, through the first fish, through the dinosaurs, through the first timid mammals, and finally to man, was about to unfold. The world waited. EVOLUTION was about to begin.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Microsphere", "genres": "Life Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/117784-evolution\n"}
