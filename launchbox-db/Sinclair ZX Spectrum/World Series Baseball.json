{"altername_name": [], "name": "World Series Baseball", "overview": "In this early UK-developed baseball simulation, one or two player matches can be played over 3,6 or 9 innings, with 3 different computer skill levels. The rules are explained by some introductory screens, and the game is fully faithful to these. Gameplay is in an arcade/action style, so you don't need to worry about statistics for different teams or players. The main viewing area is a forced-perspective view of the field, with a small side-viewed window of the pitcher's delivery itself. When fielding, control automatically goes to the player nearest to the ball, but a point doesn't end until the pitcher has the ball back (unless it is a home run). Features include stealing bases, pitching curve balls, or customizing the colors of each team. The game has been presented with considerable glitz, with cheerleaders on screen between innings and lots of advertising boards and other slogans.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ocean Software", "publishers": "Imagine", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78350-world-series-baseball\n"}
