{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Amulet of Darath", "overview": "... it was said that the amulet held the ultimate power and that once it had been returned to the hands of the king and once more joined as one, then Paralax and his vile supporters would return to whence they came and the land of Erutnevda should become the place of happiness and peace it had been in the past. Failure could only result in one certain thing ... total destruction at the hands of Paralax!\". With this old Tam raised his tankard to his lips, draining it dry, and then cast a soulful eye in the direction of the meager gathering who had listened to his tale ... more in hope of a refill than of artistic appraisal. When none was forthcoming, he raised his weary body to a standing posture and turning slowly, headed for the door. Your task is a simple one ... assist Zachra to locate the two pieces of the amulet before Paralax can find them. Fail and the land off Erutnevda would perish ... succeed and the trusty innkeeper will give you a horse with which to return to Darath. Either way the choice is upon your head.
