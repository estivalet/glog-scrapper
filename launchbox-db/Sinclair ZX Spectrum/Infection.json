{"altername_name": [], "name": "Infection", "overview": "Infection was completed and the master cassette was handed over to Virgin Mastertronic, but it was never published. Infection is a game for two to four players, any or all of which can be the computer. Each player plays for himself, so there's no teaming up. At least, you can deliberately team up against someone, I suppose, but the match doesn't end until only one player is left, so sooner or later you'll have to play to win. The game is played on a seven by seven grid, and the object of the game is to turn all of the opponents pieces to your colour. If you have a black and white TV or you're colourblind, then you can have each piece show a number to show which player controls it.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "H-2-O Limited", "publishers": "", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/157916-infection\n"}
