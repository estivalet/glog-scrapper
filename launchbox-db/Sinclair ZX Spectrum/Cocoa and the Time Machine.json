{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cocoa and the Time Machine", "overview": "Meet Cocoa, the intrepid, accident prone, time-travelling Mini Lop Bunny, on his first adventure. Cast adrift through space and time, Cocoa's Time Burrow materialises in the 15th Century. With no fuel to get home...and desperately short of parsley to munch, Cocoa needs to use his skills and wits to refuel the Time Machine, recover valuable artefacts and satisfy his ferocious parsley craving. Cocoa's Time Machine has transported his burrow to 1452AD, but he's used all his fuel in getting there. He's on a mission to recover priceless artefacts for his collection, but is easily distracted by Parsley - his favourite food. So, find the artefacts, refuel the time machine, munch parsley, and get home in time for tea... ...if only it were that simple, his new timeline has recently suffered a pandemic, and panic buying has left the land short of many essentials. The King, for one, has a desperate problem...can Cocoa help?", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "2020", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Minilop Retroware", "publishers": "Minilop Retroware", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/144727-cocoa-and-the-time-machine\n"}
