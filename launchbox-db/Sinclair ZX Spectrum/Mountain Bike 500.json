Its quite good with competent multi direction scrolling in mono. The jumps required are sometimes spectacular. This game did nothing to compete with Gremlin's Super Scramble Simulator that was already budget priced by the time this came out.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Michael A.
