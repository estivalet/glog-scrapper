{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sprouty", "overview": "You are Sprouty, the living Brussels sprout. It is Christmas and you have to collect your presents, these are spread over 18 levels, and to get to them you have to overcome a lot of obstacles, avoid a lot of enemies and flick a lot of switches. You control Sprouty with only two keys: \u201cO\u201d and \u201cP\u201d to go left and right. So where is the jump botton..?? It is very easy \u2013 Sprouty is so excited over Christmas and all the presents, so he is jumping all of the time \u2026unless he is walking. This jumping element makes the game far more challenging than other platform games where you have to push a button to jump, so you have to plan your route through the screens carefully. You also have to be aware that Sprouty can take a fall from any heights, but he will then be paralyzed for a moment, so make sure there is no enemies near when doing this.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "December 23, 2019", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "", "developers": "Dave Hughes", "publishers": "Stonechat Productions", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvphjzMutP4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/157644-sprouty\n"}
