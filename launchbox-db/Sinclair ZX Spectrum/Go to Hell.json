{"altername_name": ["Go to Hell"], "name": "Go to Hell", "overview": "The aim of the game is to rescue a person you told to go to Hell. To do this you must drive him through a huge maze in order to collect six crosses, then make your way to the hidden room and meet the master of Hell. There're lots of badies everywhere: shooting your small white crosses at them will increase your energy a little. You can fully recover your energy level by placing yourself on the special flashy crosses. Once you have collected all six crosses, you must head for the hidden room which is located at the upper-right section of the maze.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Triple Six", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQQo0B5j1H8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/112896-go-to-hell\n"}
