{"altername_name": [], "name": "Turbo the Tortoise", "overview": "After Doctor Mulliner and his assistant Beckett make a mistake using Cybernetic technology prototypes, Mulliner\u2019s pet tortoise Wal is given super powers. The only way a working machine can be built is for this tortoise to travel through time and collect the required parts from six time periods (Prehistoric, Ice Age, Egyptian, Mediaeval, 20th Century and the Future). Taking the role of Turbo the Tortoise, the player must travel through six side-scrolling platform levels, each of them well-guarded by enemies. Limited weaponry can be collected, although jumping on the heads of these foes will also kill them. Turbo must allow for moving platforms, switches, fragile platforms and water hazards. Enhancements and extra lives are in hard-to-reach places, often only accessible by using enemy heads as launch pads.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Visual Impact", "publishers": "Codemasters", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/97524-turbo-the-tortoise\n"}
