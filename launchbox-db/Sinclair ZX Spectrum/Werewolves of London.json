{"altername_name": [], "name": "Werewolves of London", "overview": "A curse has turned you into a werewolf, which is surely bad news for your employment and relationship prospects. The only way to rid yourself of the curse is to kill all the relatives of those who inflicted it. The more you kill, the more the police want to capture and jail you, but with the right equipment you can get out and continue your murderous rampage. The game is an arcade adventure viewed at an angle. Collect as many objects as you can from people, including Underground tickets to get around London more quickly, torches and manhole cover removers to access and function in dark areas, and bandages to repair shot wounds. These objects can be stored for later use, even inside your jail cell.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Viz Design", "publishers": "Mastertronic", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24_epWU8y8M", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/30469-werewolves-of-london\n"}
