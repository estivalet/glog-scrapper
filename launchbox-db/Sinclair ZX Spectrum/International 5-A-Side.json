{"altername_name": ["International 5-a-Side Football"], "name": "International 5-A-Side", "overview": "This game aims to recreate five-a-side football as accurately as possible, from a side-on forced perspective. The main tournament involves 8 international teams, with 2 skill levels and variable match lengths. Five a side football differs from the full game in many ways. The teams consist of 4 outfield players and a goalkeeper \u2013 the outfield players can\u2019t encroach into the goal area (which is a semi-circle rather than a rectangle). The arena is walled, making judging ricochets important, and the ball can\u2019t be hit above head height.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Zeppelin Games", "publishers": "Zeppelin Games", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148261-international-5-a-side\n"}
