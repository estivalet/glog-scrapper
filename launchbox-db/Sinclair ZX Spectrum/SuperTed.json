Your mission is to catch them all and put them behind bars before the bomb goes off. But beware - there are hazards lurking in the castle which can rob you of your magic powers just when you need them most, making it easier for the gang to carry out their plot. Can you guide SuperTed through the castle's twisting maze of corridors and paths to find Texas Pete, Bulk and Skeleton in time? Can you help to jail all the crooks before one of them has a chance to escape? Will the technological teddy be able to foil their foul felony?
