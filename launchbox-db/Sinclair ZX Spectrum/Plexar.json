{"altername_name": ["The Roads of Plexar"], "name": "Plexar", "overview": "Before being wiped out by a virus, the Miracle Engineers build a network of stunning roadways linking the 16 islands of Plexar. Many have tried to work out how to use these; none have returned alive - could you be the one? There are two types of road to be negotiated to reach each of the control towers, one of which is constantly moving and the other is fully controllable. Both play in a similar manner to Trailblazer, with a 3D view as you guide the ball across different types of squares (differentiated via shading rather than colors, as the graphics are monochromatic to avoid the Spectrum's colour clash problems). On the constant moving sections you can jump variable distances, while dodging hazards is more important on the controllable sections. Once inside the tower, gameplay changes to a top-down view, seeing you try to avoid contact with the control robots to make the tower safe.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Paul Hargreaves", "publishers": "Mastertronic Added Dimension", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/122763-plexar\n"}
