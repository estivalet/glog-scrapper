{"altername_name": [], "name": "Flip Flap", "overview": "Flip Flap is a computerised version of pinball. The graphics are smooth and clear and the score combinations are inventive. Pinball enthusiasts will certainly enjoy this. The game includes all the features of the real thing, such as bumpers, traps, bonus scores and tilts and there's also moving targets to hit and a gamble option to give you extra points and balls. Add to this the fact that there are no less than 20 tables to play, each new table being offered after you've beaten the target score on the previous one, and you've quite a good game.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jim Scarlett", "publishers": "Software Supersavers Ltd.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/119494-flip-flap\n"}
