{"altername_name": [], "name": "Kwah!", "overview": "When everyday wimp Kevin Oliver says \"KWAH\" he means business. Saying \"KWAH\" transforms him into the superhuman Redhawk. Redhawk, the daring superhero who single handedly defeated Fusor, Techno, The Rat and Merlin all in one day and still had time to prevent a nuclear holocaust before tea. It is up to you to continue the adventures of Redhawk by controlling both Kevin and Redhawk in this interactive comic strip. As you give Kevin and Redhawk commands, the outcome of these is shown as a real time comic strip. You must make your decisions quickly as time waits for no man (superhuman or not). While you consider your actions, the other characters in the game will continue with their own.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Silhouette Software", "publishers": "Melbourne House", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/84572-kwah\n"}
