The narrator and the instructor of the player locates him into the story of the game as he starts inside a secluded refuge supposedly built by Faust, a German who like his namesake, sold his soul to the Devil. This hideaway is called the \"Faust's Folly\" and is filled with mutated creatures and treasure quests that demand objects to be found. The game's goal is to take all of the treasures outside of the hideaway with the help and by commanding the player's mysterious instructor. The first loading pack comes with the introduction of the story of the folly and its connection to Faust as much as with the gameplay of the game, narrated by the same entity the player will command while playing it. The second loading pack is the game itself. There the player starts to specify guesses about directions to important hidden important places in the game. The guider supposedly knowing about those important locations, clarifies the player with cold / warm clues which depending on the player's directional choices will approach or deviate him from them.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "P.
