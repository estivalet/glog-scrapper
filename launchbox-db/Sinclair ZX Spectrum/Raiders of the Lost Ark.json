{"altername_name": [], "name": "Raiders of the Lost Ark", "overview": "In this adventure game you must make your way past obstacles to find the Lost Ark of the Covenant. Along the way you'll acquire adventure points, which will be scored at the end of the game. The Ark of the Covenant is hidden somewhere outside the Egyptian city of Cairo. The Valley of Poison is studded with towering mesas, one of which holds the Well of the Souls and the Ark. Each time you restart the game, the Well of the Souls is placed randomly inside one of the mesas. Therefore, the Ark will probably not be located in the same mesa from game to game. To reach the secret Map Room, you'll first need to enter the cavernous Temple of the Ancients, where you'll pick up objects to help you on your journey. The journey is a dangerous one; you are given three lives to play.
