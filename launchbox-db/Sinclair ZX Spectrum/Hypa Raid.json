{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hypa Raid", "overview": "For security reasons, the parts of the revolutionary \u2018MIG Starfighter\u2019 are held in various departments of the factory. Each department is security locked and can only be entered if you are carrying the correct \u2018lock\u2019 card. The two most vital parts are stored in special rooms where access is computer controlled. To enter these rooms, you will also require the correct \u2018data\u2019 card. As extra security, parts of the factory floor are booby-trapped so be careful where you walk. The power for your protective suit comes from 4 built-in micro-batteries. Any contact with a Russian guard, or a mistake whilst negotiating a booby-trapped floor, will result in partial power drain from the batteries, Total power loss means instant death. Movement within each department is by walking left or right or by pressing \u2018activate\u2019 when directly over an arrow. Movement between departments is either by the security doors or by pressing \u2018activate\u2019 when over a \u2018Hypa-Port\u2019. \u2018Lock\u2019 and \u2018Data\u2019 cards are collected by pressing \u2018activate\u2019 whilst walking over them. There is only a certain amount of time to collect all the \u2018Starfighter\u2019 parts and rendezvous with your back-up team in the tele-port room. If you take too long ... you are dead!!", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nigel Edwards", "publishers": "Atlantis Software Ltd.", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCremqKK0fM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/121330-hypa-raid\n"}
