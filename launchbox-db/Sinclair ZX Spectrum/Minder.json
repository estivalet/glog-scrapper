{"altername_name": [], "name": "Minder", "overview": "To those of you who already know the popular Thames T.V. series, the character, language and habits of those people in \"Minder\" will need no introduction. For the rest of us this booklet will try to explain a little about the world we are about to enter. The real skills, however, can only be found by playing \"Minder\" for yourself and learning as you go. The game is about trading: the buying and selling of any goods, however suspect or strange, in order to make a profit for our hero, Arthur Daley. In Arthur's world a \"Minder\" is a bodyguard, but Arthur's lad Terry does a lot more than just protect him from aggro. He also delivers goods (for which he has to be paid) and is the carrier of news, good and bad. Finding Terry can be a problem sometimes, but it's usually worth the bother. Stepping into Arthur's shoes, you have 14 days to make as much money as possible. You start off with \u00a32000 and a small selection of goods to sell. The way in which you trade to make the most cash in such a short time depends on experience, knowledge and how many risks you're prepared to take.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Don Priestley", "publishers": "dk'tronics", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmUAFFyiT4M", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40324-minder\n"}
