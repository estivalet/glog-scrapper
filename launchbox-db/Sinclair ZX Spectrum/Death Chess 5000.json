{"altername_name": [], "name": "Death Chess 5000", "overview": "You thought Chess was a civilized, relaxing game but 'what\u00b4s this?' I hear your cry. 'Death Chess 5000' is nothing of the sort. You may think that this appears to be like any other chess, but wait, 'what\u00b4s going on?' your trying to take a piece and look, the screens changed. You\u00b4re on a battlefield, bombs are being dropped from a helicopter 'slow down or you\u00b4ll get hit' ... 'quick into the city where you\u00b4ll be safe'. All that just to take a pawn. It\u00b4s more difficult to take pieces now, your queen has been lost in a space battle and you only just managed to climb a castle under the falling barrels of a rook.\u0a0d\u0d00 You can see now why this is no ordinary Chess game!\u0a0d\u0d00", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Anthony Adam", "publishers": "Artic Computing", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147714-death-chess-5000\n"}
