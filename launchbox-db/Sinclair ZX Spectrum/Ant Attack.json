{"altername_name": ["Ant Attack: Hormigas"], "name": "Ant Attack", "overview": "Ant Attack is a ZX Spectrum computer game by Sandy White. It was published in 1983 by Quicksilva, and converted to the Commodore 64 in 1984. It was one of the first, if not the first, isometric 3D games. The player controls either a boy or a girl (the game allows to choose at the start) who has to enter the walled city of Antescher (a reference to the artist M. C. Escher) in order to rescue their significant other who has been captured and tied up somewhere in the city. The city is inhabited by giant ants which chase and attempt to bite the player. The player can defend themselves by throwing grenades at the ants. Once the hostage is rescued, the two must escape the city. After this, the whole thing starts again with the hostage located in a different part of the city, with each location being progressively more difficult to reach than the previous.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Angela Sutherland", "publishers": "Monser S.A.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.22", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant_Attack", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkCLit8Hs9A", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/29997-ant-attack\n"}
