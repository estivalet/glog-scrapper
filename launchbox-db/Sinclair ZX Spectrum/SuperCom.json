{"altername_name": [], "name": "SuperCom", "overview": "AIM : An insane criminal megalomaniac is holding the country to ransom with his computer-activated nuclear warhead. The government can't track him down; it's your task to hack into his computer and deactivate the missile. GAMEPLAY : The game is basically a hacking simulation, like SYSTEM 15000; starting with an incomplete phone number (818-771xx) which you've managed to intercept, you must work your way around the Evil One's security systems to hack into and switch off the nuclear warhead. Your modem has five modes: Dial, Link Analysis, Display Information, Load/Save and Phone Bill Display. Most of these are obvious but Link Analysis and Display Information are special functions which, if used together, can extrapolate information from certain systems and have the info displayed on your screen. These functions are very useful if you are to find codes or information to allow you to break into other computer systems.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Atlantis Software Ltd.", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm5FUIciHps", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/115362-supercom\n"}
