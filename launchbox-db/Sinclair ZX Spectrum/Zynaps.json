{"altername_name": [], "name": "Zynaps", "overview": "This horizontally-scrolling shoot 'em up features 16 levels and 450 screens of Nemesis-inspired action. You pilot a spacecraft through the levels, shooting as many of the encroaching meanies and mounted turrets as possible. Power-up tokens are offered for shooting some, which can be used to obtain better weapons including ground-attack lasers, speed ups and multiple bullets. Extra lives are on offer as well, which you'll certainly need, especially as you have to go back a long way when losing a life.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hewson Consultants", "publishers": "Hewson Consultants", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.57", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zynaps", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZlITRk0T2w", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/101973-zynaps\n"}
