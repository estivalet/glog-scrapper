{"altername_name": ["Golf", "ZX Spectrum Pro-Am Golf"], "name": "Spectrum Golf", "overview": "Spectrum Golf allows yourself or with another player, the chance to play either a 9 hole or 18 hole round of golf. Each hole is shown from above with all of the hole seen on the screen showing the fairway, green, rough, trees, water and bunkers. There are no clubs to select so you only choose the direction and strength of each shot. To take a shot you first select the direction (1 - 12) mirroring the face of a clock, then you select your strength (1-100). Hitting the ball into the rough means you are unable to hit it as far and once on the green, putting is the same procedure as hitting the ball on other parts of the course. If playing a two player game then each player takes it in turn to hit the ball.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "R&R Software", "publishers": "R&R Software", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/Q3u8GaoxVgk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148544-spectrum-golf\n"}
