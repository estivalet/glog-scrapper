{"altername_name": ["Page's Castle Quest"], "name": "Pages Castle Quest", "overview": "An alien spaceship has crashed into the castle and scattered the treasure all around the castle and beyond. It's our hero's job to collect as much of the hoard as possible before finding his way out. Beyond the castle lies an unfriendly Jungle, maybe he can find safety in the caves which lie beyond... but don't go too deep, there are tales of terrible things lurking deep below ground! Guide our hero through 30 levels picking up objects along the way, if you miss one you can come back later. There are a few powerful amulets scattered around which can restore a life, but be careful not to waste a life trying to recover one!
