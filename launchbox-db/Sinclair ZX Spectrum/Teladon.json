{"altername_name": [], "name": "Teladon", "overview": "You are on a mission to navigate the empire of the evil Teladon and kill him by activating a self destruct device. To explore and descend downwards into the complex you must race your bike down tunnels as well as walking around searching corridors and killing Teladon's minions. There is no oxygen so you must find pods to top up your supply. The game has two different playing styles. The tunnel sections are a 3D driving game where you are behind the bike as the scenery and minions come towards you. The corridor sections use a 3D isometric view from an elevated angle where you move around on foot. You use the keyboard or a joystick to control the bike or your character.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nick Eatock", "publishers": "Destiny Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/123635-teladon\n"}
