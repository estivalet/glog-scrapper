{"altername_name": ["Moonstrike"], "name": "Moon Strike", "overview": "Moonstrike is a vertically scrolling-down sci-fi shoot 'em up game, taking place on the Moon. The player is in control of a spaceship capable of breaching the lunar defences, with the ultimate mission to destroy the super weapon. The spaceship is equipped with two different types of fire-power for aerial and terrestrial engagement - blasters and mines. Both weapons are triggered by the same key, but bombardment becomes active only when the spaceship's target is moving directly above a lunar base. There are many upgrades for the fire-power of the spaceship which can be acquired when certain targets are destroyed.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Binary Innovations", "publishers": "Mirrorsoft", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1J-jLI7CFI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/112511-moon-strike\n"}
