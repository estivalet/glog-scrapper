{"altername_name": [], "name": "Stay Kool", "overview": "Space pilot Luke Warm is stranded on his crippled spaceship after one of his less successful space battles. Fortunately, the ship does have a shuttlec-raft which can be used to escape in, but being rather overconfident, Luke has neglected to refuel the shuttle before going into battle. The necessary fuel rods are on board somewhere, but Luke was not too careful about where he stowed them and so they are scattered around the huge ship. The damage to the ship has sent haywire some of the automatic equipment and robots and has also released some of Luke\u2019s less than friendly pets. This makes travelling around the ship rather hazardous! Meanwhile, the crippled fighter is falling towards a nearby star and the ship\u2019s thermometer is rising steadily. Can you guide Luke around the ship, collecting all the necessary fuel rods, and finally reaching the Shuttle Bay before Luke Warm becomes Red Hot?", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Leigh Hugill", "publishers": "Bug-Byte Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/CpTBR9jjcKk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148570-stay-kool\n"}
