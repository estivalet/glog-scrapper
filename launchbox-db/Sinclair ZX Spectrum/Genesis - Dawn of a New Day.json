{"altername_name": [], "name": "Genesis: Dawn of a New Day", "overview": "They never took the Dork menace very seriously. First they thought they would never dare to attack, then that we would easily beat them... mankind never learns. Now the Earth is invaded by those creatures, and you are the pilot in charge of saving everyone. Does it sound familiar to you? Maybe one of those combat simulators said something similar. But things could never be that easy. When they first attacked, the definitive weapon was designed, something that could free us from the Dork: the Genesis spaceship. But, why building it in the Earth? That would be too simple. It is much better to outsource the job to other planets, and then we would assemble the ship. Well, they never expected the invasion to be that fast, and they did not think that someone would have to go and collect the Genesis parts... Guess who. So this is the situation. You are on your good old spaceship, in a secret hangar, getting ready to try to escape from Earth, visit five planets to gather the Genesis parts, assemble it and finally come back home, to free the planet from an angry alien invasion... all on your own.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "2010", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "retroworks", "publishers": "Retroworks", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/146861-genesis-dawn-of-a-new-day\n"}
