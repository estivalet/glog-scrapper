{"altername_name": [], "name": "Defenda", "overview": "Defenda, for the Spectrum, is another version of the well-worn arcade favourite Defender. Your ship appears above an alien landscape and it can move in all directions on the screen. When you move horizontally the landscape below scrolls across the screen and the aliens materialise, ready to kill or be killed. As in the arcade version, the alien ships have a habit of picking up refugees who are on the ground. If you shoot an alien which is carrying a refugee the little figure will fall to the ground and die. It is also your job to rescue refugees who look as though they may meet with a sticky end.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Interstella Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78862-defenda\n"}
