{"altername_name": [], "name": "Repulsar", "overview": "Repulsar takes its cue from Missile Command; shots are being fired at your planet's six major cities, and you are in control of the planetary defences. With limited firepower for each wave, you must destroy all incoming shots before they reach the ground and destroy a city. Shots which hit your base reduce the amount of ammunition you have left. Once a wave is cleared, you get a points bonus for the cities left and for unused shots. This version also has planes flying around your airspace, to destroy (for a points bonus) before they can unleash further shots. Keyboard and joystick versions are loaded from opposite sides of the tape.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Andrew Beale", "publishers": "Softek", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repulsar", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OXTNFIzHiQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/144488-repulsar\n"}
