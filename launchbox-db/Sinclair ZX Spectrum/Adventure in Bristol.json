{"altername_name": [], "name": "Adventure in Bristol", "overview": "Adventure in Bristol is a game in which you must go around the centre of Bristol finding clues, and ultimately performing the action that will halt the adventure. You begin outside the SS Great Britain and you already have the first clue. You must read the clue before you get the next and you may only read a clue once. The adventure must be complete in 90 minutes - this is not real time - different actions take different amounts of time. TIME tells you how much time has passed and WAIT lets 5 minutes pass (you will need this!)", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Garry Lancaster", "publishers": "Garry Lancaster", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.81", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8A0LUWln3A", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/103299-adventure-in-bristol\n"}
