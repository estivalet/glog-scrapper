{"altername_name": [], "name": "Double Bubble", "overview": "Dou and Bub are naughty bubbles, always getting into trouble, but this time, the thing was complicated. You control Dou and must guide Bub to the exit of each level. Bear in mind that Bub moves slower than Dou. If you get pass all 25 levels that make up the game you can escape your so yearned atmosphere. Beware of spikes, enemies and other dangers lurking. Each level has limited time, but you can expand it by collecting the clocks that appear on stage.
