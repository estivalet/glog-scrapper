In normal conditions, getting rid of him would not have been difficult; but unfortunately for our lady, it was the night of the witches, moment of maximum satanic power ... Thanks to a powerful spell he managed to plunge the evil entity into a deep sleep, without achieving the necessary exorcism to remove it from his body and end the possession.
