{"altername_name": [], "name": "Crossfire", "overview": "The town and docks of old Chicago are in the grip of the Mob. Al Capone and 'Legs' Diamond rule supreme with half the city's politicians and police force on their pay-role. As one of Chicago's bravest policemen, you have been chosen to lead the 'Untouchables', a crack squad of honest police officers whose brief it is to rid Chicago of the Mob and return law and order to the city. This is war, but the battlefield is the city's streets. Beware, a face at the window, a shadow on the fire escape, is it the Mob or just an innocent citizen caught up in the CROSSFIRE?", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Pantheon Software", "publishers": "Atlantis Software Ltd.", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/118130-crossfire\n"}
