{"altername_name": [], "name": "El Poder Oscuro", "overview": "We attended an emergency meeting of the Board of Directors of Xeloc, a leading company in the Solar System, dedicated to the research and development of new energy sources. The president speaks to us: - As you all know, the planet Siros, of the Alpha Centaur system, has become in a short time one of the largest energy sources in our solar system. We owe this to the effort of all the technicians installed there, who, almost in record time, have managed to put into operation the immense and sophisticated Central of Processes of Energy Transformation. And we must make special mention of the energy systems engineer, John Yaniro, who has almost fine-tuned the defensive system, as well as much of the structural design of the plant. But I have not gathered you here to tell you the wonders of Siros: it seems that a terrible threat looms over the planet. We have received and recorded a communication from Syros a few hours ago. Communication has since been cut off and all efforts to restore it have been in vain.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Arcadia Software", "publishers": "Zigurat Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/IgHdPlW6Ip0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/144963-el-poder-oscuro\n"}
