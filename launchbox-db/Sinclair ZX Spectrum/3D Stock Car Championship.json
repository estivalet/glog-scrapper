{"altername_name": [], "name": "3D Stock Car Championship", "overview": "Up to four players can compete (Interface II only) in the championship, racing cars around 24 different circuits. On each circuit the players must first compete for grid position in the qualifying period before competing in the actual race. When the lights turn green the race is on. The player with the most points after the 24th race is the stock car champion. Select the method of control for each of the four cars by using keys A and Q to choose the car number (1-4) and W and S to select the controls. Each car has eight forward gears; you may only accelerate to the top level of speed for the gear you are in. A quick on/off of the accelerator changes gear up or down depending, respectively, upon whether you are accelerating or braking. You start to reverse when continuing to brake after your speed has reached zero.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ace Software", "publishers": "Firebird Software", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/93107-3d-stock-car-championship\n"}
