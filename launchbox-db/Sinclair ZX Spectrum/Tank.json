You control a tank (surprisingly enough) armed with machine guns and cannons in this top-view scrolling shoot 'em up with arcade roots. Arrows guide you as to the optimal route. Available tokens to collect include fuel and equipment. Destroy enemy tanks and bases with the cannons, and infantrymen with the machine gun. There are rivers to cross using bridges, landmines, and enemy installations to beware of.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Choice Software Ltd", "publishers": "Ocean Software Ltd.", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/103979-tank\n"}
