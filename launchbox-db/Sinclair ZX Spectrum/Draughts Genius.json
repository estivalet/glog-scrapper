{"altername_name": [], "name": "Draughts Genius", "overview": "Draughts Genius allows you to play the computer at a game of Draughts. There are eight skill levels and you also have a choice of which colour you want to be. The game is viewed from a 3D 1st person perspective with the board seen at a slight elevated angle. The computer is depicted as Albert Einstein and he sits at the other side of the board. The idea of the game is to take all your opponent pieces by jumping over them into a empty square opposite it. You each take it in turns to move a piece diagonally and can only move forward. You have to take a piece if you can even if you don't want to. Once you reach the other side of the board with a piece you get a king piece. Your opponent puts a taken piece on top and now the piece can move forwards and backwards. If you jump a piece and you can jump another one then you are allowed in the same go. A draw can take place if you reach a stalemate where a piece cannot be taken.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Rack-It", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/139859-draughts-genius\n"}
