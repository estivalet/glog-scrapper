{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Drive In", "overview": "The object of the game is to help Dezzy escape The Drive In, by reassembling an old intergalactic starship, parts of which can be found in the various rooms which make up the DRIVE-IN. The spaceship must be assembled in the correct sequence inside room 189. You will find that your energy reserves are in short supply, and you must find ways of replenishing them. Some of the rooms contain automatic garages, banks, swap shops and time machines. You must take full advantage of these facilities if you are to survive. You will find a variety of different objects, all of which have their uses. You must learn how to manipulate these objects to your best advantage. Keys 1 to 4 allow you to pick up and drop objects, but only when Dezzy is directly over them. You can carry up to four objects or ship's parts at one time. When travelling from room to room, you must obey traffic lights on the doors, avoid contact with 28 different aliens, if possible, and in certain rooms, hold the correct coloured key for the door you wish to travel through.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "David W.
