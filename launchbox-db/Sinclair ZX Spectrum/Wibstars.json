{"altername_name": [], "name": "Wibstars", "overview": "You play the part of a software / hardware distributor in the 8-bit days. Buy computers and games then sell them to shops for a profit, perhaps collecting some more on the way from sloppy rivals that drop stuff out of the back of their trucks. Beware though, getting to the shops is only half the battle, there's a whole load of platforms and traps to pass as well. Gameplay varies between vertical scroller and side-on platformer.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "A'n'F Software", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "0.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/104125-wibstars\n"}
