{"altername_name": [], "name": "Impossible Mission II", "overview": "You as the Agency's Field Agent must reach several objectives to prevent the world from being destroyed. Firstly, you must assemble the 3-digit pass code for each tower while at the same time avoiding and fighting off Elvin's robots, using his own security system to help you. Then you must locate and open Elvin's safes and recover the musical sequence locked inside. After securing the musical sequences you must tie them together into a full melody that will open the express elevator doors to Elvin's central tower control room. Finally you have to find the correct computer terminal in Elvin's control room that will disarm the missile launch codes before they destroy you and the world. You score points by entering towers, exploring rooms, finding passcode numbers and reaching the central control room. The sooner you reach the control room, the more points you earn.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Novotrade Rt.", "publishers": "Epyx", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.2", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossible_Mission_II", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-tqtZuXGNk&t=60s", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/54508-impossible-mission-ii\n"}
