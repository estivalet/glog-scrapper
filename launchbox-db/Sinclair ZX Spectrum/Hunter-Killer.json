{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hunter-Killer", "overview": "Hunter Killer is a submarine simulation game set in the North Sea off the German / Danish Helegoland coast during the Second World War. You are the commander of a British 'S' type submarine on a mission to find an enemy submarine in the area and sink it. The coast is heavily mined, so sailing in too close, may result in hitting a mine or running aground. Going outside the area will expose you to destroyers that are hunting for you. Aircraft patrol the area, so staying on the surface can be fatal.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Protek Computing", "publishers": "ABC Soft", "genres": "Vehicle Simulation", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojK8J8zFG1M", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/105379-hunter-killer\n"}
