The player is security officer, who controls a special BOMBER unit, and must destroy all enemy rebel robots - to do this he must lay bombs in every location of the level. BOMBER has limited energy, so the player must catch special POWER MITE units. Enemy robots have various speed and intelligence. Each level has several fire doors, opening and closing at random blocking access. Once a level is completed a new level with a different layout starts. The player starts with three lives which are lost if you touch an enemy. Once all are lost, it is Game Over.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "January 1, 1983", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/115334-robot-riot\n"}
