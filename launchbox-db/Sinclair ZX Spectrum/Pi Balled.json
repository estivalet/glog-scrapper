{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pi Balled", "overview": "Pi-balled is a clone of the arcade game Q*bert . Each level has a pyramid like structure covered in tiles, the Pyramid of PI. The main goal is for the main character BURT to change the tile's colours by stepping on them. To complete a level, every tile's colour has to be changed into the one indicated at the right top of the screen. Enemies circulate around the pyramid making things difficult for the player. At the right edge of the pyramid there's a flying disc travelling from the bottom of the pyramid to the top. The player might catch it but to be successful he has to pick the right time to jump otherwise he will lose a life. After a while the player will be automatically dropped from the disc when it reaches the top of the pyramid, or he can manually jump during the course. Touch ing enemies will cost you a live, jumping off the edge will also, once all three lives are lost, it's game over. PIMAN, the trademark image/icon/character of Automata will make an appearance as the main antagonist.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78020-pi-balled\n"}
