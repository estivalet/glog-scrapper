{"altername_name": [], "name": "Strike Force Cobra", "overview": "The Enemy has kidnapped the world's top computer scientists, and is intent on cracking into your supercomputer. Strike Force Cobra must penetrate his hideout, crack his computer codes, and rescue the scientists before any of this can be done. To crack the code you use a DLB (Digital Lock Breaker) which is more effective when more numbers have been found, and the scientists give these when rescued. Your team of four members of varying nationalities is chosen from a pool of 8, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. The game is viewed isometrically, and you move the characters (one at a time) through the lair, shooting down intruders and clearing any traps for the other members to go through.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Five Ways Software", "publishers": "Alternative Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_Force:_Cobra", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/104028-strike-force-cobra\n"}
