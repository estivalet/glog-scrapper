{"altername_name": [], "name": "Wild West Hero", "overview": "Being alone in the West was never particularly safe, even at the best of time, so when the Wild West Hero took up the challenge of ridding the rockies of bandits he found a few slight problems. Being outnumbered sixty to one can be irritating especially when some annoying person has planted 'Killer Cacti', 'Treacherous Trees' or some other lethal objects around the battle area. Combined with the fact that the killing of one gang simply brings yet another bigger, nastier and faster gang of bandits made life, well, somewhat awkward, but then again he was 'The Wild West Hero'.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Timescape", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/104120-wild-west-hero\n"}
