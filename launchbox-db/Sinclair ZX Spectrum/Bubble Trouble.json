{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bubble Trouble", "overview": "Bubble Trouble is an arcade maze style game in which the main goal is to collect all of the objects present in the scenario during a specific period of time. Each scenario corresponds to a different level. While collecting the objects, the player has to avoid contact with some moving big bubbles which will chase him when his presence is detected. If a collision occurs one of the player's lives is wasted. The number of bubbles and the period of time a scenario has, both vary depending on the level of difficulty chosen before the game was started. By order of difficulty: Novice (one bubble / 60s); Intermediate (two bubbles / 90s); Expert (three bubbles / 120s). To complete a level it's imperative to acquire at least all of the objects present in the scenario during the mentioned periods of time. Only then, the player can start accumulating points which will randomly appear in the maze in the form of collectable objects. These \"objects\" start to appear in a succession of pairs of 200, 500, 700 and 1000 points. After all the points in the double succession are picked up, a question mark shows up on a random point of the maze. If successively picked it will allow the player to immediately finish the level without having to wait for the rest of the necessary time to pass the level.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bruce Rutherford", "publishers": "Arcade Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5UHHk2D8Qc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/103846-bubble-trouble\n"}
