{"altername_name": [], "name": "Barchou", "overview": "Aliens attack earth and drop on the cities! Of course the player can't let this stand, takes the astronaut gear and sits on a flying chair (at least according to the box art) to blast the attackers. The action takes place on a single screen and four cities are placed at the bottom. The player character, about the same size as a city, can freely move around the screen and use a laser to shoot also moving aliens. Those drop bombs which, if not destroyed in time, reach and destroy the cities. The player character dies when touching aliens or their projectiles. When all aliens are dead, the next level with higher difficulty begins. The game is lost when either all lives are gone or all cities are destroyed.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Zafarullah Karim", "publishers": "Central Solutions", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.07", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6n4DXUIs1U", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/117980-barchou\n"}
