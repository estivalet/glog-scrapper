{"altername_name": [], "name": "Quetzalcoatl", "overview": "Once given the map, you may call it up by pressing M. Every time the map is used it will disintegrate further but each new level starts with a new and complete map. The map shows the walls, the players position and the position of the blue (safe) shafts but it does not show the position of the black shafts. WARNING: Bumping into the walls may prove fatal. (They may collapse on top of you). First select your skill level from 1 to 6. Levels 1 to 4 slowly increase in difficulty. In level 5 there is no map and in level 6 no compass. You will need to gather a number of beads to survive the natives at the end of the game. During the game, help can be found by consulting the book of ancient lore. This can be done by pressing H for help.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/115440-quetzalcoatl\n"}
