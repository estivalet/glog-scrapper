That sheriff, who 30 years ago had liberated the people of Aleantes, has become the worst tyrant in history. The secondary characters of the Topo games have seen their opportunity to receive the protagonism that belonged to them and that was taken away. Sheriff Bill MacColl had kept them subdued by promising to give them the role of their lives. Then came the 8-bit crisis and they resigned themselves to the greatest forgetfulness. Now the retro returns and, the forgotten characters, rebel against the power usurped by the evil sheriff, prepare to free themselves from the oppressive yoke. Private Yuri Dimitrov of R.A.M. It will be who will lead the search and execution of the tyrant MacColl. Not in vain he, and not FOX, was the one who should have played the role of \"good\". But in Topo they mixed the roles and the poor soldier was assigned to be massacred and humiliated throughout the game. Now Dimitrov has the opportunity to enter the lair of the evil sheriff to free the games from his terrible dictatorship. Only you can help Yuri regain his lost honor, but beware, MacColl's bunker is full of traps and henchmen willing to defend their boss from him at all costs.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "2017", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Topo Siglo XXI", "publishers": "Topo Siglo XXI", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151644-topo-mix-game\n"}
