{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Games: Summer Edition", "overview": "You start as a member of the 1988 U.S. Olympic Team to compete at the Olympic Summer Games. You can play eight events, including Velodrome Sprint Cycling, Hurdles, Pole Vault, Hammer-throw, Uneven Parallel Bars, Rings, Archery, and Springboard Diving. You can practice each event separately or play the whole competition. The game also features a multiple player option, this makes it a nice party game. If you are alone, you can compete against the computer. If you're stuck in an event, or want to get better, just take the coaching book (= the manual) and read how you can make more tricks. It also features many real facts of the history of the Olympic summer games.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Epyx", "publishers": "Kixx", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/105383-the-games-summer-edition\n"}
