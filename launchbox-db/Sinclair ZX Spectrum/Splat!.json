{"altername_name": [], "name": "Splat!", "overview": "A spider must be guided safely through a maze, eating all the patches of grass. The screen scrolls in four directions, and the walls of the level are in a different pattern on each level, and must always be avoided for fear of losing a life. The main thing making life harder is that the level is always scrolling in random directions, and contact with the wall at the edge of the screen costs you a life. As a result, careful planning is required to ensure that you don't get trapped into a corner. There are seven levels of increasing difficulty to get through.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Incentive Software", "publishers": "Alternative Software", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splat!_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/112583-splat\n"}
