{"altername_name": [], "name": "Super Seymour Saves the Planet", "overview": "In the sequel to Seymour Goes to Hollywood, Seymour takes on his first movie role - as an eco-friendly superhero. With game design showing some obvious influence from Bomb Jack, Seymour jumps around a series of single screen areas collecting barrels of toxic waste. One barrel at a time is highlighted and is worth more points than the others, but will explode after a short countdown. Seymour is plagued by mutants which fly and bounce around the screen. Some must be jumped on from above, some must be hit from below.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Codemasters", "publishers": "Codemasters", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/102945-super-seymour-saves-the-planet\n"}
