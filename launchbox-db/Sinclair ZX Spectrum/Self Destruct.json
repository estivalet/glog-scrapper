{"altername_name": [], "name": "Self Destruct", "overview": "You are the Commander of a manned Space Station situated in the galaxy of Amoeba. During a routine inspection, you have discovered a serious radiation leak which has left you with no alternative but to evacuate the station and set the self-destruct system. Suddenly you realise that, in your haste, your space suit was left in the Control Room. Without it you cannot leave with the rest of the crew. There is not enough time to get back to the Control Room by the normal route, but there is a short cut. By using a rope, ladder, bucket and crane, there is just enough time to recover your suit and escape before the station blows up. Think calmly and logically, time is not on your side. Each section of the station is \"locked off\". You will need to obtain a green condition on the yellow doors to proceed to the next section. Take heed of the dues given.
