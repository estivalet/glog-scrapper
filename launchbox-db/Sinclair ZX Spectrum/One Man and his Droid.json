{"altername_name": [], "name": "One Man and his Droid", "overview": "Control a droid on the planet Andromadous trying to herd Ramboids (alien sheep) into a teleporter. First the droid has to travel through a chamber filled with constantly moving Ramboids. Then the Ramboids must be herded towards the teleport receptor in a particular order. Each level must be completed within 20 minutes. As well as the droid's standard movement mode, it can also tunnel or dig through the caverns. In later levels, the cavern designs become more complex and moving blocks create further problems.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Mastertronic", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.62", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Man_and_His_Droid", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/93347-one-man-and-his-droid\n"}
