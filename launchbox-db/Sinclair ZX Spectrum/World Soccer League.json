{"altername_name": [], "name": "World Soccer League", "overview": "All your Players have a Form Rating based on their current position in the Squad (ie Defender, Midfield Player or Forward), but you may find that some Players are being played out of position and by moving them to another position (eg Move a Player from Midfield to Attack) their Form Rating may improve significantly. You can only make 2 Alterations each week. Press C for \"CHECK TEAM\" and then Press A to Alter and Enter the No. of the Player you wish to move. The Form Rating of your Players may also be affected by the number of matches they have played and by the overall Team performance. For example, a regular Player in a successful Team may improve his Form Rating, but if the Team is playing badly, then your Players may suffer from a lack of confidence and this can lower their Form Rating.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/104096-world-soccer-league\n"}
