{"altername_name": [], "name": "Drug Watch", "overview": "In this game you play the role of a teenager who is new to the big wide world. The gameplay is played very similar to Space Invaders but instead of shooting lasers at aliens you actually shoot the word \"NO\" at drug pushers who are shooting drugs at you. You have a resistance bar and every time a drug hits you it gets lowered until you end up dead of a drug overdose. This game was published by the Nottinghamshire Constabulary as part of their \"Just say NO to drugs\" campaign. There is even a flashing message that reads \"AVOID ALL DRUGS\" which is both helping you to play the game and maybe burning the message into your subconscious.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jeff Brammer", "publishers": "Nottinghamshire Constabulary", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/119201-drug-watch\n"}
