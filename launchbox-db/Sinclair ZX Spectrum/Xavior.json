{"altername_name": [], "name": "Xavior", "overview": "You are the last member of your race. You have to go through the underground complex consisting of 4096 rooms, collect 256 parts of DNA and restore your race. More than 256 different types of creatures (differing only in animation and color) hinder you. Each room has a door. The blue balls in the rooms allow you to open four doors each, so use them carefully. Monsters materialize in the room after a while, so you can manage to run through the entire room without engaging in battle.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "PSS (Personal Software Services)", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/104080-xavior\n"}
