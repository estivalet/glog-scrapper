{"altername_name": [], "name": "Snake Escape", "overview": "Snake Escape is a puzzle game where you control a snake through increasingly difficult mazes, in order to escape and reach the food. It features 38 levels converted from the web game Lime Rick (most of them harder than the original version) and a few extra (even harder) new levels. Technically, the game includes AY music and it's implemented using the Nirvana+ Engine, which allows the ZX-Spectrum to display full-screen multicolored sprites (i.e. combine more colours than normally possible without colour clash).", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "2016", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Einar Saukas", "publishers": "Einar Saukas", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/PBmFzZuxPzY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72595-snake-escape\n"}
