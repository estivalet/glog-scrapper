{"altername_name": ["ZX Mines 2.0"], "name": "ZX MINES 2", "overview": "Second part of ZX Mines for Sinclair ZX Spectrum, written in C and ASM to avoid the speed limitations of the original BASIC version. It also has a cover and inlay to make yourself an original tape, and C source code. It has 3 board sizes (like difficulty levels) and Spanish-English messages. Using O, P, Q, A keys we move the cursor over the mine board, and with the space key we unfold the cell under the cursor. If there is a mine, then the game is over, but if it isn't, the computer will show the number of mines that are in the 8 adjacent cells. Using this numbers and being careful, we can unfold every cell without mine, and so beat the game.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "2003", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Santiago Romero Iglesias", "publishers": "Compiler Software", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/104058-zx-mines-2\n"}
