{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dragon Breed", "overview": "Zambaquous has done everything to make life hell for the people of Agamen, and as their King Kayus, the time has come to head out to destroy him. This leads to six levels of horizontally-scrolling shoot \u2018em up action, although with some vertical movement as well. The thing which sets the game apart from every other horizontally-scrolling shoot \u2018em up (except Saint Dragon) is that you are riding on the back of a dragon, called Bahamoot. Both you and the dragon have firepower, and holding down the fire button increases Bahamoot\u2019s energy bolt\u2019s ferocity. The dragon\u2019s tail can be controlled indirectly, and because it is indestructible, it can be used either as a shield, or as a weapon in its own right. There are power-ups to collect by dismounting from the dragon and walking into them. These include fiery breath, bolts shot from Bahamoot\u2019s tail, homing missiles of sorts, and lightning bolts, with only one ever active at a time. Each level has a time limit.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Activision", "publishers": "Activision", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Breed", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/53567-dragon-breed\n"}
