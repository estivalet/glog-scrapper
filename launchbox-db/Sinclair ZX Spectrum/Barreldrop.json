{"altername_name": ["Barrel Drop"], "name": "Barreldrop", "overview": "In Barreldrop, you must help Gordon unblock his drainpipes by dropping barrels onto them. The game automatically drops a barrel for you and you have to press the Space bar to drop the barrel into any of the five drainpipes marked 5 to 1. It must drop between the pipe and doing so will score you the points of that pipe. Failing to do so will cause the barrel to be lost, unless you guide his dog Flash to help you. When Flash becomes available you have to press the D key and he will return a missed barrel before it is lost. You need to clear all five pipes to complete the level, if all five pipes are not cleared after losing all your barrels your game is over. Before progressing to the next level however, you must complete a mini-game task which varies from answering a riddle to shooting aliens. Completing the task will advance you to the next level while failing the task ends your game.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Russell Vincent", "publishers": "Games Machine Ltd.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.62", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJtehb9hrAs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/117984-barreldrop\n"}
