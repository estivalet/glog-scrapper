{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hopper", "overview": "Hopper borrows the Frogger style of gameplay, for one of many games inspired by the arcade hit. The road has six lanes to cross, each very densely populated with traffic. Permanent logs and temporary turtles are used to get across the river, and reach one of the five home cells. After filling all of them the game moves up to a higher difficulty level. A range of keys can be used for each control function.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "PSS (Personal Software Services)", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/125477-hopper\n"}
