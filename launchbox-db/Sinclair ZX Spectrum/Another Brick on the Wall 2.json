{"altername_name": [], "name": "Another Brick on the Wall 2", "overview": "Another Brick On The Wall 2 is a game based on the typical brick crusher, whose main exponent is Arkanoid. The game is a continuation of the one submitted to the BASIC de Bytemaniacos contest in 2004, having been the winner in the \"simple\" category. ABOTW2 is made up of 25 levels that we will have to overcome to finish the game. To make it more complicated, a couple of characteristics have been added: when you have been on the screen for a while, new bricks will start to appear randomly and our paddle will advance positions, making it more difficult to reach the ball in time to bounce it again.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "2005", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "", "developers": "Compiler Software", "publishers": "Compiler Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/144107-another-brick-on-the-wall-2\n"}
