{"altername_name": [], "name": "Skull", "overview": "In the game, make your way through a maze, collecting treasure. Try to avoid the skull(s) in the maze at your level as they will kill you. Watch out for trap doors and holes as these drop you into a deeper part of the maze, which is harder. You can collect crosses, jewels and two kinds of coins. You begin with a map but the map slowly rolls itself up then you rely on memory and/or luck.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "I.C.
