{"altername_name": [], "name": "Stop the Express", "overview": "The trip was calm until somebody noticed that the train was out of control, skipping traffic light after traffic light, and you, travelling in the last carriage, decide to stop it. To your surprise, you discover that the doors between the carriages are closed. To stop the train, climb onto the roof of your carriage and carefully walk along until you arrive at the engine car. Take care - the saboteurs who have left the train out of control will attack you, trying to make you fall. They will throw objects from behind you and ahead of you. (To avoid the objects dive to the ground). While en route you will sometimes be able to go back inside the train and continue your journey. Large birds can be seen flying at the edge of the screen. Whenever you are in time to catch them you can set them free to help you against saboteurs.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hudson Soft", "publishers": "Sinclair Research Ltd", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.42", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_the_Express", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/52429-stop-the-express\n"}
