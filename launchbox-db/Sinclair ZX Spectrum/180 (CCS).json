{"altername_name": [], "name": "180 (CCS)", "overview": "180 is a darts simulation game. It will appeal to both dart players and non-dart players as it is extremely addictive. There are four types of games to choose from one player championship game; two player game 101, 301 or 501; Round the Board; and Snooker, a two player game, where sections of the board represent colours. There is no luck involved in these games - only 100% skill!", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "John Hunt", "publishers": "CCS", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.41", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SfqEo3wK74", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/91767-180-ccs\n"}
