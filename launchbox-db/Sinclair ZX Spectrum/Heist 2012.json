{"altername_name": [], "name": "Heist 2012", "overview": "The year is 2012 and the financial institutions of the Earth and its colonies are almost entirely on credit. For the few who still use 'real money', large banks have been constructed, the largest of which is the L.D. International United Bank. This bank, located in Switzerland, is so big that most of its employees don't know their way around it. You are a poor computer systems engineer with the dream of becoming rich.

So watch out for those cyber-guards and get hacking!", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Firebird Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFX9DwIvzg4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165172-heist-2012\n"}
