{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sheepwalk", "overview": "It is a fine Spring day down on the farm - the sheep are grazing contentedly in their pen and the warm sun is shining down on Farmer Brown's crops. Oh no! The sheep have escaped from their pen again and are roaming all over the land. Some are munching their way through Farmer Brown's prize radishes and beetroot, and others nave fallen into the river. Using only your trusty sheepdog Rex, you must round the sheep back into their pen without delay. Careful though, don't let Rex get too close to the animals or he'll frighten them away. Send Rex into the river to rescue the floundering sheep then bring them safely back into the pen. But remember, they may still wander out again! Then hurry over to the vegetable patches to protect the crops from the hungry sheep. Guide Rox through this area carefully, for he too can cause a good deal of damage to the crops. When your sheep are safely back in their pen, your skills as a shepherd will be assessed. Points are awarded for speed and are deducted for sheep lost and the amount of damage done to Farmer Brown's crops. A shepherd\u2019s task is a hard one - 'Sheepwalk' will have you counting sheep in your dreams!", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/115465-sheepwalk\n"}
