{"altername_name": ["Prva Akcia"], "name": "Prv\u00e1 Akcia", "overview": "Prva Akcia is a shooter with some light platformer elements. You play Arnold Dubovsky that resembles a certain other Arnold we know. You're a member of the city police, still called 'greenhorn' by your fellows. One day, in the middle of your routine patrol a single shot breaks the silence. It doesn't take too long to realize that the shot came from the city bank. While other people running away, you're nerveless and ready with loaded gun. A few moments later you enter assaulted bank. This is your first serious case, your FIRST ACTION. The main objective of this action game is to find and liberate captured hostages (director and his secretary) inside the bank. Armed with the pistol and slightly protected with the bullet-proof vest (which represent your 1 and only life) you have to also eliminate all 10 gangsters. But before you'll disable last bad guy, lock up entrance to the bank so he won't escape and close emergency shaft so he won't use helicopter prepared on the roof.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "July 3, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Microtech Systems", "publishers": "Ultrasoft", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147367-prva-akcia\n"}
