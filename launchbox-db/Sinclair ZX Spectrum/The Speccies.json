{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Speccies", "overview": "Guide your Speccie onto their respective coloured pads to complete each level. Once you start a Speccie rolling, it won't stop until it hits a wall, a lock, a shrub or even another Speccie. Same colour items only affect the same colour Speccie. Collect hearts to increase your lives and jokers to prevent you losing a life when you roll over a bomb of the same colour. Rolling over a clock will increase the time limit you have to complete the level. There are 101 levels to complete... let's roll!", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "2013", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "TARDIS Remakes", "publishers": "Tardis Remakes", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151564-the-speccies\n"}
