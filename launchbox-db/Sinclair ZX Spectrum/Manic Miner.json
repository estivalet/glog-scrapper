{"altername_name": [], "name": "Manic Miner", "overview": "You play the role of Miner Willy, a bold explorer and adventurer. He discovers a network of underground caverns used by an advanced but now extinct civilization, and realizes that the mines contain lucrative metal ores. Through 20 caverns, Willy must collect all treasures before the time (air) runs out, watching out for the nasty guardians, the obstacles, long falls, quicksands and all elements to be found in a classic platform game. The game is linear, and each room's exit only becomes available once all the items have been collected. Close contact with an enemy or stationary hazard, or falling a great distance, causes the player to lose a life and restart the level.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Matthew Smith", "publishers": "Bug-Byte Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.37", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manic_Miner", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWQjPsXgwdk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/17374-manic-miner\n"}
