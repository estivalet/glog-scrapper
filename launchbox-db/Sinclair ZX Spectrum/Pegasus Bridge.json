{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pegasus Bridge", "overview": "Few hours before the Allied forces hit the beaches on D-Day (6 June 1944), an element of the British 6th Airborne Division made a night landing using gliders and parachutes, initiating Operation Deadstick. Its task was to capture the bridges on the Caen Canal and the river Orne, the only way east for the Allies from the 'Sword' beach. Pegasus Bridge is a platoon/company level wargame, set during the World War 2, and played in turns split into phases. The player may command either British or German side (there's also two player and demo mode). Fatigue and morale effects are taken into account. The player may change the landing site and the game will simulate paratroopers scattering due to high wind. Apart from the usual infantry, tank and artillery units, German gunboats, gun emplacements (which may be captured) and frogmen (trying to demolish the bridges) are also featured, with air and naval fire support.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Data Design Systems", "publishers": "Personal Software Services", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pegasus_Bridge_%28video_game%29", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDkXOQPSavw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/118828-pegasus-bridge\n"}
