{"altername_name": [], "name": "Daley Thompson's Olympic Challenge", "overview": "The third licensed game based around the legendary British decathlete did something slightly wider in scope than the basic Games style of play. Before you play the main events you have to train in the gym. Weight-lifting, squats and sit-ups are included, which involve waggling the joystick as fast as you can to fill a displayed bottle of Lucozade (clever bit of product-placement there). The better you do at this, the better you'll fare in the events, which are predominantly waggling-based as well. They include the standard decathlon events of running, jumping and throwing as well as you can. There are four types of shoes available, and choosing the wrong one for the event will seriously hamper your performance.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ocean Software", "publishers": "Ocean Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.62", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78480-daley-thompsons-olympic-challenge\n"}
