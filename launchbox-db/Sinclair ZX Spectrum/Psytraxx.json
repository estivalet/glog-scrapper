{"altername_name": ["Pystraxx"], "name": "Psytraxx", "overview": "There was a twinkle in the Emperor Robot's eye that gave him a knowing appearance. You would have been forgiven for thinking that this master robot was almost human, the glint in his eyes betraying a gloat of satisfaction. After all, the Emperor Robot now ruled the entire Droid Kingdom of Quon. His minions were all round, and all were totally submissive to his will. But if you had looked more closely you would have seen the source of that glint in the multi-faceted eye. A tiny light source within that could only be mean one thing - a psytraxx microdroid was hard at work. Circuit malfunction is a fact of life, even for the tyrannical Emperor himself. Through his Psytraxx circuitry, then, ran the microdroid - trained by the Emperor himself to be totally reliable; totally obedient. The peak of the droid-maker's art, the microdroid was barely larger than the rogue components it was programmed to track down. But this microdroid had slipped through the system, and was out for revenge for his oppressed fellow droids. He would seek the key program cards to deactivate the force-fields, he would find the Master key-cards to gain access to the Emperor's CPU, and... never again would that tyrant sit and gloat. But the microdroid didn't anticipate the vast number of sectors in the tyrant's Psytraxx-network... more than one thousand!", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Andrew Beale", "publishers": "The Edge", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113337-psytraxx\n"}
