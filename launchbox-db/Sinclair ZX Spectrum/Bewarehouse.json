The problems: Unfortunately this warehouse is haunted, and ghosts don't like intruders. They will try to stop you like this: They will roll and throw boxes and barrels at you constantly \u2014 more on each level. On higher levels, ghosts will appear. They may either chase you or simply block your path for a while. Unlike the ghosts, your energy is limited, and drains even faster when you have to jump.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tom Cannavan", "publishers": "Positive Image", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.6", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/117985-bewarehouse\n"}
