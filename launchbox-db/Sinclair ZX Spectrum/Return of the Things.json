{"altername_name": [], "name": "Return of the Things", "overview": "Your quest starts in the swamp to the east of the Tower. Here your exit has caused all the things to be killed. However if you move far enough you will find swamp things which are even more powerful than the tower things. If you move further afield other types of thing created by the evil Lords will attack you, the landscape will also change greatly as you move around the lands surrounding the Tower. Your magical powers are far greater than they were before you escaped the tower, offensive spells (fireballs and lightning bolts) no longer require any of your limited magical energy only defensive spells affect this. Magical energy may be replaced by collecting the potions which are scattered over the land.
