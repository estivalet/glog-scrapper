{"altername_name": [], "name": "Assassin", "overview": "You are the Rt. Hon. Bob Fossington Kiwi - a freelance mercenary and assassin. He has been hired to infiltrate a colony asteroid that houses hundreds of yukky mutants and confront the dreaded Asteroid Worms and obtain four pages of a manuscript for his employer. To get a page you must gain access to a sub-game by feeding a monster to an Asteroid Worm and then taking it on in mind combat whilst it's got its nose bag on. To do this you must use the 1 - 5 keys to match with the numbers on the screen and once you've made it across the screen then you've done it. This was given away for free with Crash magazine No.79 (August 1990).", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Andrey John Remic", "publishers": "Psychaedelic Hedgehog Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/153967-assassin\n"}
