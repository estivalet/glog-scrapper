{"altername_name": ["Rentakill Rita"], "name": "Rentakill Rita", "overview": "Rentakill Rita is a flick-screen isometric arcade adventure inspired by Head Over Heels. The player's task is to clear an infestation of bugs from Ditching House, owned by a decrepit and financially struggling lord. Jeeves the put-upon butler can only afford one name from the yellow pages - Rita. Her methods are unusual, eschewing chemicals in favour of large weights, which she must position in order to crush the bugs. Simply reaching them has its own layer of puzzles to solve, hazards to avoid and treacherous paths of moving blocks to follow.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mastertronic Ltd.", "publishers": "Mastertronic", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/113341-rentakill-rita\n"}
