{"altername_name": [], "name": "Apple Jam", "overview": "Eat as much jam as you can and as many apples as you can without getting too fat, otherwise you'll have a fit and lose one of your pills; but you haven't got many so jump into the sauna to slim off, but while you're in there the tiny rat will eat the jam and the apples you miss and get big and bold and come up to bite you dead, but you can jump into the lift to go up and down. So if your timing is right you can squash the rat and get on with eating to increase your score to release rat bait to keep the rat tiny, but beware the hornet zooming past (to be avoided at all costs) by jumping into the sauna, otherwise it will sting you dead and the ambulance will come to take you away. And the best of luck!", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ed Hickman", "publishers": "dk'tronics", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.06", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78716-apple-jam\n"}
