{"altername_name": ["Crime Busters Featuring Bennie the Burglar"], "name": "Crime Busters", "overview": "Bennie the Burglar knows that Slough's elite people will all be at a barbecue this evening, meaning this is his chance to burgle their mansions - if the Crime Busters force can't stop him. Crime Busters is a platformer with four available opponents (Spy, Copper, Ghost and Maggie), a two-player mode and a practice mode. Bennie must first collect five items from each mansion, then escape by using a trampoline no more than four times. Avoid being captured and thrown in jail, though items to be collected regenerate when you do.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Arno P.
