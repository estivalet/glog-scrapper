{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pac-Man", "overview": "PAC-MAN scores points by eating the dots in the maze whilst avoiding the ghosts. Flashing Power Pills are located in each corner of the screen. Eating a Power Pill will turn the ghosts blue with fright for a few seconds, during which time PAC-MAN may chomp the ghosts to score more points for each ghost he catches. They will blink before they turn back to their true colors and then PAC-MAN had better beware! When Pac-Man has eaten all the dots, he reappears in a new maze where the ghosts move faster. In each successive maze, it becomes harder for PAC-MAN to eat all the dots without being caught. Pac-Man ca travel from one side of the screen to the other by using the escape Tunnels. The pursuing ghosts are slowed down through these tunnels so make good use of them. At the beginning of the game PAC-MAN has three lives. He is rewarded with an extra life when he reaches 10,000 points. Extra points can be earned by eating the bonus fruits which appear from time to time. If PAC-MAN is caught by a ghost then he loses one of his three lives.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "David J.
