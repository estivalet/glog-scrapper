{"altername_name": [], "name": "Kai Temple", "overview": "Kai Temple is a simple platform game. The player is trapped inside the temple and must escape. Their only weapons are a dagger and a lethal kick! The player has just four chances to escape before it's game over. Guards at the temple fall into two categories; Divas, who can be defeated with the dagger, and Ninjas who will only succumb to close combat. The player must also ring a bell whenever they come across one. To make things a little tougher, the game screen also has a tendency to flip upside down without warning, usually disorienting the player at a vital moment!", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ian Wright", "publishers": "Firebird Software", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aIzoeriimk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/121872-kai-temple\n"}
