{"altername_name": ["Zulu Wars"], "name": "Zulu War", "overview": "Zulu War (called Zulu Wars on the title screen) is a turn based top-down strategy, based on the real Anglo-Zulu War. The game has 2 scenarios - \"Ulundi\" and \"Umlalazi\". At first, the player controls commander Lord Chelmsford, in the second he controls Mayor-General Crealock. In both scenarios, he commands the British Army against the forces of the Zulus. He controls better armed troops (cavalry's and infantry's squads), but the Zulus outnumber his forces. Units can move and shoot, but they have limited movement points (replenished in the next turn). Several types of obstacles (houses, trees, walls) are impassable to armies. The game has 3 difficulty levels.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Astros Productions", "publishers": "Cases Computer Simulations", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8QnOavmZdk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/85222-zulu-war\n"}
