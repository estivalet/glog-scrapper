{"altername_name": [], "name": "Invasive Species", "overview": "You play as a yellow wasp like insect and must wipe out the other species before it's too late. The task is simple, sting the big species correctly matching the coloured bars at the bottom, and everything else including the big plant must be pinned down before they will die. Once that is all done, you should be able to collect the diamond before moving onto the exit and the next screen. Just be careful though, as with this many insects flying about, you can get yourself trapped and there's no way out! A very enjoyable game indeed and with one of the best ZX Spectrum tunes I've heard this year!", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "2016", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "The Death Squad", "publishers": "The Death Squad", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/149640-invasive-species\n"}
