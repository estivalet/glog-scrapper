Comments such as 'check', 'well I never' and 'oh well' will also be interjected by the computer player when appropriate. There are seven skill levels, with all but the easiest of these offering a move suggestion feature. The ability to edit the board layout is provided, even during a game. Current positions can be printed or displayed to the screen.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Chris A.
