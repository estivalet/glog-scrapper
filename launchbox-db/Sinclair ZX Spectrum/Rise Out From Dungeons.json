{"altername_name": [], "name": "Rise Out From Dungeons", "overview": "Rise Out From Dungeons is a platform game where you must guide an unnamed character through 20 dungeons avoiding traps and blue-colored men. The graphics and game mechanics are strikingly similar to Lode Runner, but with a twist. The objective in each dungeon is simply to \"rise out\" from them, and that can be done by climbing a stair which passes through the dungeon ceiling.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "", "developers": "Anton Markin", "publishers": "Magic Soft", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJdUpMOLRNg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/158134-rise-out-from-dungeons\n"}
