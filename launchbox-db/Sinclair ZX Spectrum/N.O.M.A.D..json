{"altername_name": [], "name": "N.O.M.A.D.", "overview": "Out in the vastness of space lies the heart of an Intergalactic Criminal Network, TALOS, a man-made asteroid slowly spinning through the void, spreading its evil through the Universe. At the head of this seemingly unstoppable force sits one man, the unspeakably vile Cyrus T.Gross. A name spoken only in whispered voices, Gross is the embodiment of all that is criminal. Avoiding any attempt to curtail his ever spreading empire, he has crushed all opposition and seems invincible, ruling his depraved Zealots with a fist of iron and a heart of ice. In a last ditch attempt, the rulers of the Free Worlds have called in the Nemesis organisation, a hardened cadre of humanoid and robotic freebooters who have assigned N.O.M.A.D. 471 (Nemesis Organisation Mobile Attack Droid) to penetrate Gross's heavily armed homeworld and destroy this vile despot once and for all. Your mission is to guide N.O.M.A.D. through the four sections of Capital City towards Gross's inner sanctum. You arrive at the spaceport and must then progress through the slums, into the city centre and penetrate the HQ; \"Dun Dentin', before you reach his personal quarters for the final deadly confrontation. Many dangers await you in all sections of Capital City. In true cowardly style, Gross has installed magnotrons, heat-seeking missiles, and an infinity of equally deadly obstacles, all of which must be confronted and conquered.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Ian Weatherburn", "publishers": "Ocean Software Ltd.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/55597-nomad\n"}
