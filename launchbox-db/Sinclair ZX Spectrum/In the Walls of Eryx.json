{"altername_name": [], "name": "In the Walls of Eryx", "overview": "In the Walls of Eryx, created by Kevin McGrorty \u2013 with a rather colourful cassette inlay, and upon loading it up we find not only a splendid loading screen but some rather grand animation from our hero Private Stansfield who is stood in front of his burning, downed spacecraft, in the Erycinian Highlands of Venus, tapping his foot. The goal of the game is to guide Pvt. Stansfield through the jungles of Venus looking for six power crystals. However the Venusian wildlife aren\u2019t overly fond of this gem-snatcher and seek to end his life; to top it all off Stansfield\u2019s oxygen is rapidly running out. You need to get the power crystals, keep your oxygen topped up and survive.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "2016", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kevin McGrorty", "publishers": "Monster's Legs Productions", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/149478-in-the-walls-of-eryx\n"}
