{"altername_name": ["H.E.R.O.: Helicopter Emergency Rescue Operation"], "name": "H.E.R.O.", "overview": "There is trouble in the mines! Volcanic activity has trapped numerous miners, and it is your job to save them. As Roderick Hero, you need to make your way through the dangerous mineshaft avoiding the dangerous creatures and lava, and find out where the miners are located before you run out of energy. H.E.R.O. was converted from an Atari VCS cartridge game of the same name. The Speccy conversion is almost identical to the console original - hardly surprising seeing as the graphics are nothing much! However, the playability remains excellent.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Software Conversions Ltd.", "publishers": "Activision (UK)", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.83", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.E.R.O._(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OdyM5l85ds", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147497-hero\n"}
