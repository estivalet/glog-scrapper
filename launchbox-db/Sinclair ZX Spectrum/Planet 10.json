{"altername_name": [], "name": "Planet 10", "overview": "Planet 10 is 3D Pac Man clone. The game has a sci-fi story - people have discovered 10th planet, but scout ships sent to this planet were destroyed. The planet has very dangerous artificial creatures. The player moves in a 3D maze (but he has 2D map - looks like Pacman in a very small screen), collects \"dots\" (squares) and avoids ghosts. He uses a special radar and can see near ghosts. If he has a special power-up, he can kill/eat ghosts. The game was finished and was reviewed in gaming magazines but didn't get released, likely due to copyright issues.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "", "developers": "Davor Magdic", "publishers": "Mastertronic", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147307-planet-10\n"}
