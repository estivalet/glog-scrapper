{"altername_name": [], "name": "Star Warrior", "overview": "There are three distinct sections to this space shooter. The first is Galaxians-inspired, with waves of aliens coming down the screen towards you firing at you, with your craft able to move vertically or horizontally (wrapping around sideways). Section 2 involves moving down the screen whilst avoiding a multi-directional asteroid field. The final phase of the game involves reaching a target in the centre of the screen, whilst avoiding a constantly tracking Cyborg unit and having to reach the bottom of the screen to refuel. These then loop with increasing difficulty.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "John Edwards", "publishers": "Visions Software Factory", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/717Fy205MFk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/144307-star-warrior\n"}
