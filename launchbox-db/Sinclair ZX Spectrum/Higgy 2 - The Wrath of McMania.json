It was the wrestling heel, Mr. McMania. Oiled up to the nines, he cracked his knuckles. Titchy hissed and launched herself at McMania. He snatched her out of the air, then issued a challenge: \u201cHigton, you prick! Try to rescue your cat from my golden castle in the sky. My minions will make short work of you and your jorts!\u201d \u201cHow will I get there? It\u2019s not like there\u2019s a bus!\u201d Ian protested. But McMania had scarpered.
