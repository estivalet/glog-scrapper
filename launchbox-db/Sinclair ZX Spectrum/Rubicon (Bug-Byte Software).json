{"altername_name": [], "name": "Rubicon (Bug-Byte Software)", "overview": "Rubicon's plot deals with a catastrophic nuclear accident in Russia. The player must trek through seven levels inhabited by mutated super-intelligent animals in order to diffuse each nuclear reactor. Gameplay is a Gryzor style flip-screen run'n'gun shooter (with occasional jetpack flights), with fairly unrelenting action. Power-ups are issued by a canister which the player will have to control in order to gain the weapon they want. The difficulty level is pitched high, as with Project X which was released at a similar time.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bug-Byte Software", "publishers": "Bug-Byte Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "0.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgrDRX5v_mg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/115319-rubicon-bug-byte-software\n"}
