There are several hazards on the way however: including oil, ice, rocks, red flags and the red chase cars. The slightest contact with any of these means instant death! You also have an ever decreasing supply of fuel \ufffd if it gets too low make sure you get to the petrol pump that is somewhere in the maze and fill up. The amount of fuel you have left is displayed in the lower right section of the screen, If you clear all the flags in the Maze, you go onto the next sheet when things get even harder!", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Chris P.
