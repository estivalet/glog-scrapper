{"altername_name": ["Deathball 2000"], "name": "Deathball", "overview": "As android technology improved, it became common place for rival robotics corporations to pit their finest androids against the best their rivals could offer in tests of strength, intelligence and agility. These challenges developed into various sports - by far the most popular of these was DEATHBALL. As the public's obsession with Deathball grew, regular League and Cup competitions developed. Each team had its own ground in which the game was played; this arena consisted of a nine by nine grid of steel walls forming a maze unique to each arena. Teams consisted of eight androids and a human manager; various regulations controlled the specification of the androids. The team manager, however, did have considerable flexibility in allocating strength and agility within his team. The object of the game was to locate the ball and carry it to the arena's only goal. In order to do this the attacking team - the team with the ball - had the option of avoiding the opposition or destroying them. The movement of the androids was controlled by the team manager who was fed information on the progress of the game through his own team's visual sensors and short range ball detector.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Steven Screech", "publishers": "Alpha Omega Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/118200-deathball\n"}
