{"altername_name": [], "name": "Blobbo", "overview": "Run at high speed around the maze collecting treasure and fruit worth bonus points - but don't get caught by the Blobbo-eaters! Tactical dodging must be employed to avoid them. If you're caught or step on a skull and crossbones you lose one of your three lives. Eating scintillating power pills gives you a charge of energy big enough to kill the nasties, but the effect soon wears off and you must rely on speed and skill to stay alive. Four different mazes combined with sixteen levels of play make this an exceptionally challenging game.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Andy Key", "publishers": "Continental Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcQzuzKtkco", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/117986-blobbo\n"}
