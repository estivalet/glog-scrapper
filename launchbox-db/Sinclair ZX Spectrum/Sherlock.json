{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sherlock", "overview": "In this text and graphics adventure mystery game you are the world's greatest sleuth - Sherlock Holmes. Teamed up with Doctor Watson and dealing with the inept Inspector Lestrade, you must solve a double murder in Leatherhead. As well as studying the clues, you must interrogate NPCs, who will react differently if they know certain information. Time is important to the game - you have a limited amount, and must make use of trains which come at varying times. Unusually, the descriptive text given by the game is kept separate from entered commands, which are stored at the bottom of the screen.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Beam Software", "publishers": "Melbourne House", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2t8crNKnpY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/77986-sherlock\n"}
