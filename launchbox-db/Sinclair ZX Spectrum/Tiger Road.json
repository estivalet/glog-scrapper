{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tiger Road", "overview": "Tiger Road is undoubtedly one of the best martial arts games ever written. Practically includes four games in one. Your mission, like Lee Woong, is to free the children who have been kidnapped by the evil Ruy Ken Oh, who wants to brainwash them and turn them into soldiers of their diabolical army. To destroy Ruy Ken Oh you must undertake a risky journey in which you will face dangerous adversaries, such as samurai warriors, giants and dragons. These are just some of the many obstacles you will have to overcome before releasing the small prisoners. Fabulous graphics and a pulsating action make Tiger Road a legend in the history of software. When the action hardens, the game even more!", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Probe Software Ltd.", "publishers": "Go!", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.67", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Road", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/53893-tiger-road\n"}
