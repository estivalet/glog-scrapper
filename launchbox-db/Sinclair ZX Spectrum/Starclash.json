{"altername_name": [], "name": "Starclash", "overview": "You are test-flying a new Starfighter in a deserted sector of space...suddenly an Imperial Strike Force jumps from hyperspace in attack formation! Your Escorts are regrouping to denfend the home base and you cannot out-run the enemy fleet...you must fight it out alone and do as much damage as you can before your own destruction...The enemy Mothership is protected by four different waves of defence fighters - and each wave destroyed leads to the next. If, incredibly, you fight your way through, you then face the mighty Mothership. You must place a laserbolt in whichever of her two power-cores is active. She will explode and your laserbolt generators will be recharged by the radiation. Your display shows at top laserbolt energy and which wave you are attacking, and at bottom right shields remaining...don't waste them! Watch too for the fiery meteors, and the very best of luck...!", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Derek Brewster", "publishers": "Micromega", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/QrzGnq33itg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148568-starclash\n"}
