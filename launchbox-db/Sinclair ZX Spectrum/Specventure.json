{"altername_name": [], "name": "Specventure", "overview": "Sitting in front of you is an innocent looking Spectrum doing no harm to anyone. But looks can deceive, there's a revolution brewing and only you can stop it. As a machine code instruction (the smallest part of a program) you must collect the escaped bytes (tiny pieces of computer information) and take them to the output. Each of the 30 screens shots a different part of the Spectrum's circuit. Beware of high voltage electrical discharges leaping across your path and every screen has system bugs which must be shot before they get you. Collect all the bytes (flashing squares) on the screen and the I/O RQ (request for transfer of data) key starts to flash. Press the button and you have 10 seconds to race across to the exit avoiding the sparks and other objects. If you run out of time you must return and press the button again. Many of the screens have a password on them. If a correct password is entered from the main menu you can start the game in different places.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Mastertronic", "publishers": "Mastertronic", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr5Z3aoIgzM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/112582-specventure\n"}
