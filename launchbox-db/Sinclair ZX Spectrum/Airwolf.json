{"altername_name": [], "name": "Airwolf", "overview": "AIM: As ace helicopter pilot Stringfellow Hawke, you have been chosen to fly the top-secret AIRWOLF helicopter. To test your prowess, the CIA has assigned you to a dangerous rescue mission: five important US scientists are being held hostage in an underground base deep underneath the Arizona desert. It's your task to guide AIRWOLF through the caverns to destroy the base's defence control boxes so that you can penetrate to the heart of the complex and rescue the scientists... GAMEPLAY: AIRWOLF bears some slight similarities to the old arcade classic DEFENDER, with a nod in the direction of GALAXIANS as well. You must shoot your way through the defence fields and electric fields protecting the caverns within the base, and avoid the incoming fire from the large and strategically-positioned guns. As well as this, you must also prevent the AIRWOLF from crashing into the base's walls and the various obstacles around it, which is not an easy task!", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Elite Systems", "publishers": "Elite Systems", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.81", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airwolf_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LOAciMPGrI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/53943-airwolf\n"}
