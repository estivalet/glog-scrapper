{"altername_name": [], "name": "Moon Buggy (Visions Software Factory)", "overview": "Moon Buggy is a cross between arcade classics Moon Patrol and Space Invaders. The player has been given a buggy (a futuristic equivalent of a caterpillar tracked JCB). The game is a single screen arcade shooter where the buggy traverses the ground while alien hostiles attack from above as well as in the same horizontal plane as the buggy. The buggy has guns that shoot straight ahead in the direction of travel and up, each level is cleared when all enemies above have been cleared. The ground is littered with potholes that have to be jumped using a built in pogo stick to be able to move left and right. If the buggy goes into a hole or it is hit by an alien or an alien projectile, one of five lives is lost. There are eight screens of increasing difficulty.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Visions Software Factory", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/R8cZT_9122g", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/146607-moon-buggy-visions-software-factory\n"}
