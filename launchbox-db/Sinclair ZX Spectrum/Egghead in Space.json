Obviously that wasn't \"un oeuf\", because they're back again and this time they've abducted Egghead's favourite Spectrum games. Quick witted as ever, our \"dairydevil\" hero managed to \"scramble\" aboard one of the alien rocket ships before it took off for planet Zog and hitched a ride back with the extra-terrestrials to retrieve his precious software collection. Upon arriving, Egghead managed to teleport into the underground labyrinth and that was when his problems really began... Move Egghead around the screens leaping from platform to platform in search of the disc containing the computer games. Try not to fall too far as eggs are delicate, and avoid any green slime you may encounter. On the other hand, the green bubbles that rise from the slime are not deadly. Numerous items can be collected along the way to help Egghead in his quest. Once the computer disc has been located, Egghead needs to acquire some transport back to Earth.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "2003", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jonathan Cauldwell", "publishers": "Cronosoft", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165004-egghead-in-space\n"}
