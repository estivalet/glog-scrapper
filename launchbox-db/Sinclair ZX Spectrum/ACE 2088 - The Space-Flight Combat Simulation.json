After arming your fighters, you select one then launch from the mother ship. The game is viewed from a 1st person perspective with an instrument panel below your cockpit window as you see the selected planet in the distance. There are enemy ships in the area and these can be destroyed by your laser or missiles while you try to avoid being destroyed yourself. You also have the choice to set a course to the planet or return back to the mother ship.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Cascade Games", "publishers": "Cascade Games", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.89", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM_u7pGbipw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/102115-ace-2088-the-space-flight-combat-simulation\n"}
