Now most Spiders don\u2019t have much difficulty catching Flies but Micky is such a ice Spider, the Flies gang up on him. Some of the Flies and Wasps land on Mickys web and then break away so as to try and destroy his web. If Micky is on the thread that the Flies take with them, then its Bye-Bye Micky!
