{"altername_name": [], "name": "Biscuits in Hell", "overview": "Biscuits in Hell is a challenging 8 level platform romp, and like the derivation of the word 'biscuit', the game is also twice baked as it was originally intended to be EFMB redux. It's difficult, but with good reactions, observation, strategy and a little luck it can be completed. You'll need most of the 128 lives though.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "2017", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Monument Microgames", "publishers": "Monument Microgames", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/144471-biscuits-in-hell\n"}
