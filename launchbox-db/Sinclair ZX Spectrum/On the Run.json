{"altername_name": [], "name": "On the Run", "overview": "Your name is Rick Swift, a troubleshooter hired by the Defence Department for dangerous missions. In your latest mission you must enter a deadly area which has been affected by an unfortunate accident involving experiments in chemical warfare. Strange and weird mutations of the plant and animal life in the area have occurred, the animals becoming deadly to the touch. Contained within the mazes are still six flasks of the dangerous chemicals which will become active in one hour. Your mission is to collect all the flasks before this happens. Because of the lethal nature of the chemicals you have been equipped with a protective suit, complete with a jet-pack to rapidly move you around the mazes which you must explore. However, this suit requires energy and this energy depletes if you come into contact with a mutant. If your energy reaches zero you will die due to exposure to the deadly chemicals. Spread throughout the mazes are various objects which may be used to your advantage; careful experimentation is required!", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Graham Stafford", "publishers": "Design Design Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/95482-on-the-run\n"}
