{"altername_name": [], "name": "Jinj 2: Belmonte's Revenge", "overview": "Jinj 2 starts right after you got your memory back in your previous adventure. That scroll you found turned out to be a music score containing the beats of what seemed to be a brief melody. The dim light in the hall didn't let you see which melody was it; so you lighted up a candle and held it near the scroll. In an instant some characters appeared on the back side of it. They made you remember who you really were. The heat of the flame had revealed the hidden message. But the flame caused something unexpected. A huge light came out of the scroll, while your name appeared. At the same time, the partiture notes on the other side start to come off and fly around you. Suddenly you see them going up and up in a seemingly eternal spiral. A strong shock that seems to come from the scroll takes it from your hand while the light it was emitting disappear all of a sudden. You leave the candle aside and sit down while your mind starts to recall. At the beginning they're flashbacks, like images coming from a toy cinema projector, but bit by bit you start to remember it all. And that's precisely what troubles you the most. You know the professor has just invoked the beings from the beyond. You know it because the scroll you found is the only way to do it. And it's also the only way to send them back to the beyond. The professor must have a setback in his world domination plan; otherwise he wouldn't have left the scroll at the mercy of a brave guy like you.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "2012", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "retroworks", "publishers": "Retroworks", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/149937-jinj-2-belmontes-revenge\n"}
