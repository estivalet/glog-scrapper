{"altername_name": [], "name": "High Noon", "overview": "High Noon is a Western Shoot-em-up game based on the arcade game Boot Hill, taking place in a scenery in yellow suggesting the desert and the sunset. The goal is as in a cowboy duel, to shoot your opponent first. Between both of the opponents dividing the screen in left and right sides, a settler wagon is slowly moving upwards, giving a certain time to the players to use it as a shield or as a strategical point for the shooting. There are also two cactus plants on each side of the gunfight that can also be used as defences, although only temporarily because they'll become increasingly more damaged and ineffective as defence by the bullets they'll receive. As opponents you can have another player or the computer, and you can choose which side to play.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Work Force", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/132479-high-noon\n"}
