{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gutz", "overview": "You've been swallowed up by a ten million ton space being with an equally large appetite. This mega-monstrosity also has its greedy eye on Earth, so you have no choice but to try and escape by shutting down the body's major organs - otherwise your home planet is about to end life as an undignified midday snack. The treacherous quest takes place over four levels, inside a vast four-way scrolling complex of interconnecting tubes. Each of the four major organs (kidneys, lungs, heart and brain) must be destroyed in turn. As they are each encased in a tough membrane, an appropriately powerful weapon needs to be assembled first, and its three parts are found around different sectors of each level. Antibodies attack from all sides shooting pellets. Contact depletes energy, and once it reaches zero one of four lives is lost. A variety of weapons are collected by moving over weapon holds hidden in the tissue walls. Other bonus icons include spare helmets, for extra protection and increased fire-power. Keys enable you to open the Super Weapon door hidden inside each of the major organ rooms. A map of the current quadrant can be called up via the keyboard. A status display indicates score, gives a large-scale grid map of the playfield, show energy and lives remaining.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Special FX Software Ltd", "publishers": "Ocean Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AECoZoreBSM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/45733-gutz\n"}
