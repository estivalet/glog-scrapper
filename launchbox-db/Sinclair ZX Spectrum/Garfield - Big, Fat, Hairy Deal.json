{"altername_name": [], "name": "Garfield: Big, Fat, Hairy Deal", "overview": "Garfield: Big Fat Hairy Deal is a 1987 computer game for the Atari ST, ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC and the Amiga based on the comic strip Garfield. It is the first video game to be based on Jim Davis' Garfield Comics. Plot: Garfield must rescue his girlfriend Arlene from the cat pound and then return Jon's map. Gameplay: Garfield starts his quest in Jon's house, and has to venture through streets, dark alleys, convalescent homes, and sewers to find Arlene. Various objects are littered along the way, and Garfield meets characters like Odie, Nermal and giant rats, that can help or hinder his quest. In some versions of this game, the background graphics are only in black and white but the sodas show a little colour. In other versions (i.e. the Commodore 64 version) the graphics are all full colour.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Neil Strudwick", "publishers": "The Edge", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garfield:_Big_Fat_Hairy_Deal", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/94951-garfield-big-fat-hairy-deal\n"}
