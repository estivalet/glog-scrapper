{"altername_name": [], "name": "Jack Charlton's Match Fishing", "overview": "Jack Charlton's Match Fishing is a multiplayer sports fishing game, released in 1985 for Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum from British Alligata Software. It is named after former footballer and coach Jack Charlton, also a well-known fishing enthusiast. Amstrad CPC and BBC Micro versions were also announced, but they are not published. Up to 8 players can participate, each of whom is randomly assigned a fishing post at a lake. The goal is to accumulate the maximum total weight of fish caught during a period of time in minutes that players decided in advance. The real-time action is minimal, but it is simultaneous with all the players assembled on the same keyboard. Initially each one is provided with a detailed watertight description of the water next to its location. Then the player makes the technical choices about the type of reed, reel, line, lure, bait, depth best suited to the situation, and launch distance. The settings can also be changed later, during the race. When the actual fishing begins, a fixed idyllic scene of a lake with a mountain background is shown and one has to wait until a fish flies. When this happens, the corresponding position flashes and the player needs to quickly press the number key. If you press it in time, a close view of the sectional side is shown, with the fisherman and the fish approaching; With a push of a button at the right time, and if the technical choices made are adequate, you may be able to take the prey otherwise they come", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78505-jack-charltons-match-fishing\n"}
