In Australia they go their way, jump into the water, shoot drunk on bottles that fly in a jeep, throw boomerangs that hit them in the head and try again and again pulling the fishing rod to the very fin of the shark. These are the things with which they have fun in Australia, apart from the Pearl Surf and the Sydney Opera House. This game was also released under the name Aussie Games.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Beam Software", "publishers": "Erbe Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.36", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7eB5ujb5c", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/104954-australian-games\n"}
