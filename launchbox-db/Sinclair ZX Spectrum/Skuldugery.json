{"altername_name": [], "name": "Skuldugery", "overview": "Skuldugery is a 2D top-down maze game. The player controls a genie, and must find various valuable treasures in an old maze (castle, labyrinth and forest), haunted by living skulls. The genie is completely defenceless - when the skull attacks the player, he loses items. The game uses very non-typical controls - player moves genie and screen independently, by using 2 sets of keys.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/125329-skuldugery\n"}
