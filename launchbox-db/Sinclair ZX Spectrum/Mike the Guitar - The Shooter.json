{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mike the Guitar: The Shooter", "overview": "As we said before, Mike The Guitar is back in action for the ZX Spectrum, but this time instead of being a platformer which appeared on both the Amstrad and the ZX, he's blasting badies in his very own side scrolling shooting game. So load it up, get ready for fun, as this game doesn't just have cool 48k sound effects, but a wicked soundtrack by Pedro, lots of enemy waves to blast and big bad bosses to destroy!", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "December 20, 2019", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Andy Green", "publishers": "Self-Published", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtube.com/watch?v=UJXCpGkeYMs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/150590-mike-the-guitar-the-shooter\n"}
