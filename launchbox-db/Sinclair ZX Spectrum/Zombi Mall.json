{"altername_name": [], "name": "Zombi Mall", "overview": "The goal is to escape alive from the mall where you have taken shelter from the horde of the undead. You will have to use ingenuity to achieve it. You'll be able to interact with almost the entire game scene, although not everything will be useful to you. Collect items, combine them and use them to solve the puzzles. Avoid zombie attacks as they can sometimes cause serious injuries that you will need to heal and clean up. Stay away from them, luckily their field of vision is limited. Dispel them by passing through one of them without making sudden movements rubbing against the corpses, but be careful not to spend a lot of time with the putrid fluids on top of you as you, just some fluid on a scratch could get you infected and become one of them! And above all, avoid leaving the mall, the horde will be waiting anxiously to savour you. Will you be able to escape?", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "September 7, 2022", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "The Mojon Twins", "publishers": "The Mojon Twins", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4S67RLzBPI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/165484-zombi-mall\n"}
