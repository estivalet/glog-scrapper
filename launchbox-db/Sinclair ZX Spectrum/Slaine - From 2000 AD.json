{"altername_name": ["Slaine, the Celtic Barbarian", "Slaine, the King", "Slaine"], "name": "Slaine: From 2000 AD", "overview": "Slaine, the psychopathic nice guy, is out with his faithful friend Ukko to lop a few heads from evil bodies in this licence based on the character from the comic 2000AD. Slaine is a very unusual game, a sort of freeform hybrid somewhere in the marshy ground between arcade game and graphic adventure. The system used to create this effect is called Reflex, an original concept involving the real time selection of text with a free floating cursor. The cursor in this case is a gory, severed hand, which points to your selection in the 'thoughts' window, snatching at the thoughts before they float out of Slaine's warped mind.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Creative Reality", "publishers": "Martech Games", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-HBvzvIWLo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72235-slaine-from-2000-ad\n"}
