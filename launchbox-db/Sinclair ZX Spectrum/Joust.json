{"altername_name": ["Ostron", "Ostron"], "name": "Joust", "overview": "Joust is probably the most original 'arcade-game' to have ever appearead. You ride an Ostron (ostrich) and do battle with various dark knights riding their buzzards. To fly you need only press the one of several keys to make your Ostron's wings flap. And you can move either left or right. To win a joust you must have your lance higher than your opponents when you touch. If they are the same height or you are lower then you die. You start with 5 lives. The Blue Bounders are not terribly intelligent about finding you and you are faster. But the Green Hunters are harder to shake off and as fast as you are! The Red Servants are diabolical in their ability to track you and give chase, and the dazzling Shadow Lords themselves are masters of their art.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Andrew J.
