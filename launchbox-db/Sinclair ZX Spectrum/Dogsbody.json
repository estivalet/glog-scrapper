{"altername_name": ["Dogsbody to the Rescue"], "name": "Dogsbody", "overview": "Nasty Dr. Dogmush is conducting experiments on innocent puppies to turn them into kannine killers. He has 192 imprisoned in his castle. The Animal Liberation Front special agent Dogsbody is digging to the rescue. Built on red sandstone the Dogmush stronghold is protected by 50 assorted robot guards and gremlins. Dogsbody can tunnel through the soil and avoid the meanies and even dislodge rocks to crush the odd gremlin or two. Mind you the gremlins do have nasty habits. Firstly, they seek you out even if you can't see them and secondly, they will be reincarnated where they started out. Flowers will grow to block pathways when Dogsbody clears an area above a flower; a useful way to trap a meanie. Keep your wits about you, as the deeper you go, the more they will come for you. The best of luck and woof, woof, woof, woof.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Steven Monks", "publishers": "Bug-Byte Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/119057-dogsbody\n"}
