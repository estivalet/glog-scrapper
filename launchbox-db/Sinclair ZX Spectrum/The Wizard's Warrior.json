{"altername_name": ["The Wizard's Warriors"], "name": "The Wizard's Warrior", "overview": "You sense evil all around you, the stench of death hangs heavy in the air - why? - this is due to the rule of the tyrannical Wizard of Wylye. The first crypts you enter have plenty of hiding places, beware these do not lull you into a false sense of security as later crypts are larger and even more lethal, namely the Abyss and the Coliseum. Enter the Wizard's realm at your peril. The crypts are infested with his minions. There are several ranks of these - beware of those with unusual and unexpected powers. Use your radar at all times to pin-point their movements. After ridding each crypt of the unrelenting minions the Wizard's Magic Eagle will appear to thwart your mission. Kill him and you will be awarded double points in the next crypt. This will anger the Wizard and he might decide to appear, teleporting himself frantically around the crypt, hurling magic bolts at you. Your only weapon besides your wits and agility is your laser rifle. Accuracy with this is vital. Hitting a minion's backpack or rifle may not be enough to kill him.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dave Hawkins", "publishers": "Crusader Computing", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/104116-the-wizards-warrior\n"}
