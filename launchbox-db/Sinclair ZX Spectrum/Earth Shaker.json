{"altername_name": [], "name": "Earth Shaker", "overview": "Earth Shaker - [by M Batty] (taken from your sinclair 03/1990) A rather talented Spec-chum called Michael Batty sent us this one. It's in the style of Boulderdash and Repton, and sees you as a small robot-type thingie scuttling around an underground land of manic mayhem. Your job is to collect all the on-screen diamonds, digging your way through the soil and dodging the stones and stuff that get dislodged and drop on your head (or not as the case may be). There are trillions of other features (see box-off) and with 32 fun-packed levels you won't be finishing it too quickly, that's as damn sure as mustard!", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "March 1, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Your Sinclair", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.1", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKRuqo3XoFk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/26442-earth-shaker\n"}
