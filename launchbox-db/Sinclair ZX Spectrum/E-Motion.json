{"altername_name": ["The Game of Harmony"], "name": "E-Motion", "overview": "This strategic action puzzle game features original gameplay. You control a spacecraft situated on a globe which you can rotate and move around the screen. You must knock globes into others of the same colour, to rid the screen of all the globes. The screen has no borders, so globes can be pushed off the side of the screen, increasing your tactical range. Knocking globes of different colors into each other produces smaller pods which need to be picked up quickly, giving you energy, or they will turn into globes and you will have to get rid of them too. Many of the globes are linked to other globes (or the ship) via string, and the level layouts include barriers as obstacles (and ricochet points), making the Newtonian physics more complex.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "The Code Monkeys", "publishers": "Erbe Software", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.42", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Motion", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/96852-e-motion\n"}
