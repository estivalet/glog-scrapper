{"altername_name": ["Tornado Low Level"], "name": "TLL: Tornado Low Level", "overview": "TLL sets you as a skilled pilot who must take on a tough mission - shooting out six discs representing enemy strongholds in built-up areas. This must be done by lowering your altitude as you approach each one, making it crucial to avoid trees and buildings which are closer to ground level. The action is viewed from above using a pseudo-3D display, and scrolls vertically in a manner similar to SWIV. At the side of the screen your altitude and fuel level are displayed, as well as an all-important mini-map. You will frequently have to refuel, which is done by touching down on the carrier. You don't have direct control over the plane's speed, a fact which takes the game out of the realm of simulation somewhat.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Costa Panayi", "publishers": "ABC Soft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado_Low_Level", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moiUgBqfyxw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/48467-tll-tornado-low-level\n"}
