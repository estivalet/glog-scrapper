{"altername_name": ["Psycho Pigs U.X.B."], "name": "Psycho Pigs UXB", "overview": "Finish your Smokey Bacon crisps and get your teeth into this meaty porky pie of a game from Jaleco. When the referee's whistle blows, it's trotters to the ground in the intergalactic pigsty as you take on a group of pigs all wishing to avoid this Sunday's dinner table. Pick up bombs and throw them at your opponents before they make sausage meat of you. Put your back into it, no time for irrashernal thinking, as you gammon to the field to keep fit and lean. Streaky movements will keep you off the scratching listings and save your bacon. This game is not tripe but brilliantly imaginative and addictive. When the whistle blows, it's a free for all as you throw bombs at your opponents before they can throw them back at you. The bombs will bounce off the sides, so watch out for the rebound. Once a bomb has been thrown, it will count down to zero and explode. Some bombs count down without being thrown. After certain levels you will be awarded a bonus round. In this case you must attempt to kiss the lady pigs (sows) as they pop up and down.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Software Creations", "publishers": "U.S. Gold", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butasan", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/93439-psycho-pigs-uxb\n"}
