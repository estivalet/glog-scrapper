Clear each space zone of hostiles before you encounter the ultimate goal, to destroy the enemy Battlestar.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Codemasters", "publishers": "Codemasters", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.92", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BteAchtMek", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/92917-3d-starfighter\n"}
