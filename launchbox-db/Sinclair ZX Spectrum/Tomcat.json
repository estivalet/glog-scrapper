One of such military installations, ARTROCK 6, had turned rogue after being hit by a violent storm, its computer-controlled defensive systems firing upon anything that comes close.

You can pick up weapon upgrades (more guns, missiles) from destroyed enemies.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Players Software", "publishers": "Players Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl40lokA05U", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/103944-tomcat\n"}
