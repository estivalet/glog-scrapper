{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dredd Over Eels", "overview": "Judge Dredd is tasked with exploring the city and tracking down The Eel King, before shooting it dead. It shouldn't be too difficult - it's just a collection of eels. However, on his way he'll encounter the other beasts transported across the aether because of Jimmy The Spug's restauranteurial ambitions. Some are harmless and may prove useful, others mean no harm but are dangerous due to their intense curiosity, some will block Dredd's path, and others are from a dark eel dimension where all marine-life is a crime.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "2017", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Monsterbytes", "publishers": "Monsterbytes", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/145786-dredd-over-eels\n"}
