{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Reaper", "overview": "Every five hundred years, a group of immortal wise men search through history to find a valiant warrior (a martial arts expert). Once they have found the chosen one, they bring his body back to life and test him thoroughly to check that his reputation is not exaggerated. They make him enter a maze, giving him the mission or saving the souls of some of his friends who have been hand-picked. Their enemies have also been woken up specially for the occasion, which makes the game very funny. You'll certainly have guessed, you are the valiant warrior and this is not the moment to rest on your laurels, because if you manage to survive amidst all these enemies you'll come back to life. However, if you fail, you and your friends will be damned for all eternity.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Clive Townsend", "publishers": "Ubi Soft Ltd", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "0.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/122719-the-reaper\n"}
