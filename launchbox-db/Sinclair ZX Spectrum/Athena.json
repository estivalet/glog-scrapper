Put on wings and take to the sky, or become a mermaid to explore the ocean depths.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Imagine Software", "publishers": "Erbe Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.22", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/96806-athena\n"}
