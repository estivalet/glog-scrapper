{"altername_name": ["Chaos: The Battle of Wizards", "Chaos"], "name": "Chaos: Magic & Death on the Plane of Limbo", "overview": "In the game Chaos, players take the role of wizards who vie with one another to win the game. The aim of the game is to be the 'last wizard standing' by destroying all other wizards. The game allows for anything between two and eight wizards, any of whom can be human or computer controlled. The level of the computer-controlled wizards must be selected, ranging from 1 to 8. Higher levels improve the computer wizards' combat statistics, but does not improve their artificial intelligence. Computer-controlled wizards do not cooperate; they will attempt to kill each other as well as the human players. Chaos is a turn-based game. Each turn, every player in order selects and casts a spell, then moves their wizard and any summoned creatures.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Julian Gollop", "publishers": "Firebird Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "8", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos:_The_Battle_of_Wizards", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pz6jtKrEIA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/30307-chaos-magic-death-on-the-plane-of-limbo\n"}
