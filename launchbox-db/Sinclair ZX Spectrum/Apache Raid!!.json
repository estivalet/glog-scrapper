{"altername_name": ["Cowboys 'n' Injuns"], "name": "Apache Raid!!", "overview": "Apache Raid is a 1987 budget game from Pirate Software that was released exclusively for the ZX Spectrum. Also known under the title Cowboys 'n' Injuns (Which it uses on the title screen), this game is particularly interesting in that you play as a Native American for once instead of the cliched cowboy we're used to. The plot from the game is pretty brief - you play as Nigel Navahoe who is out to save his tribe from the invading cowboys. In essence, it's just a flick screen shooter where you run around the reservation shooting the colorful cowboys and collecting various items, most of which don't seem to anything except pad your score. You have an energy meter that reduces each time you're hit, three lives, and a limited amount of arrows which can be replenished with pick-ups. Most of the games are actually maze-like in nature, so it's quite easy to get tapped and killed if you're not careful.
