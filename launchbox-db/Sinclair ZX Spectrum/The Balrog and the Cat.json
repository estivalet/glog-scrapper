{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Balrog and the Cat", "overview": "The Tale So Far .... There was nothing a BALROG enjoyed more than a 'green-cheese\u2019 sandwich, especially one that had been allowed to 'ferment' for a week or two! It also helped if the cheese had been laid to rest between two thick slices of good brown bread ... BALROGS have been known to go to war over such delights. However, unbeknownst to this particular Balrog, such joys were suddenly brought to a sudden end ... by a strange\u2018scratching\u2019 noise at the door of his abode. This noise \u2014 would cause him to become involved with the likes of 'Lemin-Rats', cockroaches\u2019 and nasty \u2018Red-Caps\", as he struggled to solve some very devious problems indeed. Would he be able to find the means to cross the bridge, or even to assist the young boy in his search for the 'impossible'? Would he dare to venture close enough to the dark trees Vs to locate the object of his desires? Could he attract the attention of the boat-manor, even discover the whereabouts of the runaway Donkey? The answers to these and numerous other problems are all there, but are you clever enough and brave enough to find them ..... or will the task simply be too much for both You and the BALROG ? The game was originally created for the ZX Spectrum in 1988. Wilson later converted the game to the C64 in 2019.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "John Wilson", "publishers": "Zenobi Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/155773-the-balrog-and-the-cat\n"}
