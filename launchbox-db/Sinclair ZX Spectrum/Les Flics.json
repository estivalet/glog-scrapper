{"altername_name": [], "name": "Les Flics", "overview": "Les Flics (French slang for the police) is a game inspired by the movie and cartoon character The Pink Panther. With Unspecteur Cleudeau and Gend'armerie Kaolin on his heels, the player's task is to steal a priceless gemstone known as the Purple Puma. The game starts out on the streets of a city with nine interconnected buildings. The player has to drive his car to the different buildings while avoiding the police cars that are chasing him. Upon entering one of the buildings the game switches to a side view perspective of a single screen platform stage. Each stage consists of five levels of platforms and the player uses staircases, lifts and firemen's poles to move between them. In the buildings are various objects that the player has to pick up since they are needed to steal the gemstone. There are nine items in total and it's up to the player to figure out what they do. At the same time the player has to watch out for the guards that try to stop him.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Chris P.
