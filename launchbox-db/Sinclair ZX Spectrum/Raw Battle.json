{"altername_name": [], "name": "Raw Battle", "overview": "In a near future, T-Corp rules the World. Only few live as kings while the rest of population dies of starvation living under strong repression. Natural resources are scarce, so, to keep the control, T-Corp is developing a new foodstuff for the high class: the \u201cSoylent\u201d, an obscure superfood made with the flesh of people sacrificed on creepy processing plants. These plants are hidden in dangerous zones controlled by the \u201cDrugos\u201d, who were failed experiments made by T-Corp to create the perfect soldier. Only you, a mercenary known as \u201cSnake\u201d, have the guts to defeat T-Corp and send these evil plants to Hell.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "2017", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kabuto Factory", "publishers": "Kabuto Factory", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151081-raw-battle\n"}
