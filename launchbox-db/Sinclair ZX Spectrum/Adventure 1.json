{"altername_name": ["Classic Adventure"], "name": "Adventure 1", "overview": "Classic Adventure is a reworking of the 1978 Will Crowther and Don Woods text adventure game Colossal Cave Adventure which has spawned so many copies and variants over the years. The game was originally released as Adventure 1 by Abersoft in 1982 on the ZX Spectrum. It was later re-named Classic Adventure and published by Melbourne House on multiple platforms. This game is very true to the original, it starts with the classic opening: 'You are standing at the end of a road before a small brick building. Around you is a forest. A small stream flows out of the building and down a gully'. From this point the player can enter the building and commence exploring the cave system, reputedly modeled on Kentucky's Mammoth Caves complex. In the caves are some unsavoury characters, magic items and treasures to be collected and transported back to the well house. True to the original game, this version supports magic words such as 'Xyzy' and 'Plurgh' which will teleport the player between certain rooms. The game keeps a score which increases as the treasures are brought back to the well house, the maximum score that can be achieved is 210, and can be saved to a blank cassette tape.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Abersoft", "publishers": "Abersoft", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.7", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_Adventure", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/93159-adventure-1\n"}
