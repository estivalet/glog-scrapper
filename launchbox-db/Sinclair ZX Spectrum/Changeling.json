{"altername_name": [], "name": "Changeling", "overview": "This adventure is set long ago when people still believed in magic, and anything out of the ordinary was said to be the work of faerie fold. Any child that was different was thought to be a changeling, left by the faeries to fool the parents of a child they had stolen. Your life is shattered when your only son falls desperately ill. After consultation with the local wise man he is discovered to be a changeling, left there when your true son was stolen by the Tylwyth Teg, the faeries with a fascination for mortal children. Your only hope is to go to the Crystal Isle, home of Gwyn-ap-nudd, Lord of the underworld and King of the Faeries. Unfortunately the way to the land has long since been lost to mortal man. The wise man offers some hope though and tells you of an ancient tower, now deserted, but said to have once been the home of a mighty sorcerer. Legend says he left many magical things in the tower, including his great book of spells. Only there may you find the way to the land of Gwyn-ap-nudd. He tells you how to get into the tower but warns you that it guards its secrets well.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "M.J.
