{"altername_name": [], "name": "Grand Prix Challenge", "overview": "The object of the Game is to Win the Drivers Championship, and it may take you more than one season to succeed. During the race, keep an eye on the condition of your tyres, engine and bodywork. Your lap times are the best indication of when you need to call into the Pits. Aggressive driving increases tyre and engine wear, and increases your chances of crashing. Your Drivers Skill Rating is an important factor in each race. The more success you have, the higher your Skill Rating. A series of poor results will reduce your skill rating.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Challenge Software", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/5ewhXx59ysw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/146695-grand-prix-challenge\n"}
