{"altername_name": [], "name": "Flight Simulation", "overview": "Flight Simulation is a flight simulation program written by Psion and marketed by Sinclair Research for the Sinclair ZX81 and ZX Spectrum home computers. It was also marketed as Flug-Simulation in German. In the United States, Timex Sinclair marketed the ZX81 version as The Flight Simulator for the Timex Sinclair 1000 (the American version of the ZX81). The program simulated the essential aspects of \"a highly-manoeuvrable light aircraft\" in flight. Despite the limitations of the ZX81, it offered a basic graphical view of the instrumentation and view through the front window, as well as navigational aids and a full-perspective moving view of the final runway approach. The ZX81 version received a positive review from Popular Computing Weekly. As quoted on the packaging for the later ZX Spectrum version, they stated \"No words can do justice to this most elegant of programs... You will not see a better computer game till Psion produce one for the Spectrum\". The ZX Spectrum version also received generally good reviews at the time of its release in 1982, although eight years on Your Sinclair magazine considered that it had not dated well.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Psion Software Ltd.", "publishers": "Sinclair Research Ltd", "genres": "Flight Simulator", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.2", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_Simulation_(Psion_software)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gc9x85j32C8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78485-flight-simulation\n"}
