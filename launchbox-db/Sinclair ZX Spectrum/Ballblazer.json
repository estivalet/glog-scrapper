{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ballblazer", "overview": "In the year 3037, the most competitive sport in the known universe is Ballblazer. For the first time ever, humans from the planet Earth have won the right to compete in the final round of the Ballblazer Championship, to fight for Earth's honor and the title Masterblazer! Ballblazer is a 3D futuristic soccer-like game, where the player (inside a Rotofoil) is set on a one-on-one 1,155 square playing field (the Grid). The objective of the player is to kick a floating ball (Plasmorb) inside the opponent's goal (Goalbeams). A player may compete against a human or computer opponent. The Rotofoil is equipped with a multi-purpose forcefield. This forcefield when in short distance of the Plasmorb will act as a pull field, automatically pulling the Plasmorb towards the player. When a player in possession of the Plasmorb shoots, the forcefield will act as a push field and launch the ball. When the match starts, the player must move down the field, attempt to gain possession of the Plasmorb using the joystick and blast the Plasmorb to an intended direction.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Program Techniques", "publishers": "Activision", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.65", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballblazer", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78763-ballblazer\n"}
