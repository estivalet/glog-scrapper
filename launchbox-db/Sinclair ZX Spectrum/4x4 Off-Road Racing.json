{"altername_name": [], "name": "4x4 Off-Road Racing", "overview": "As well as recreating off road racing, this game has considerable capability to upgrade your vehicle. There are four choices of vehicle on offer, each of which has its own weight/top-speed/build strength and so on, and thus is suited to different circuits. You can also buy upgrades and repairs, including carrying some spares. There are four completely different types of course, each taking place on a different surface - Mud, Ice, Desert and Mountains. Each of these is littered with hazards, which can either be painstakingly avoided, or driven through (with the resultant risk of damage).", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "U.S. Gold", "publishers": "U.S. Gold", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.53", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4x4_Off-Road_Racing", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEoviaOb2ko", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/77034-4x4-off-road-racing\n"}
