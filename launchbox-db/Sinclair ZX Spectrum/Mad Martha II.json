{"altername_name": ["Mad Martha 2"], "name": "Mad Martha II", "overview": "Time for the annual holiday and Martha decides to visit her half-cousin Manuel, who is a waiter in a plush hotel in Barcelona. One afternoon, Martha sets out on a bus tour with her son, young Arbuthnot, leaving orders for Manuel to keep an eye on Henry. Unbeknown to Martha, crafty Henry has a Spanish pen-pal, and has planned a secret rendezvous. Henry leaves the hotel brimming with enthusiasm and Manuel (who is totally wacky!) is hot on his trail. The adventure takes us through the thrills and spills of a madcap chase, taking in, amongst other delights, a bullfight in which poor Henry is forced to play the leading role. Guaranteed laughs and fun for all the family!", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Saturnsoft", "publishers": "Mikro-Gen", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/kEY_ObEXY6A", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/29716-mad-martha-ii\n"}
