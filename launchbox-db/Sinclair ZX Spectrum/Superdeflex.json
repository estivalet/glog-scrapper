{"altername_name": ["SuperDeflex", "Super Deflex"], "name": "Superdeflex", "overview": "Superdeflex is a continuation of the Deflex (ZX81) game idea by Jeff Minter. A story has been introduced into the mix, Sid the silly Space Invader is fed up being shot at by laser bases, so he has run off to join a new game. The objective is to guide him through nine levels of Superdeflex, hitting ten numbered prizes on each in the least amount of time possible. Sid moves across the screen in either a horizontal or vertical direction, the player places one of two type of barriers in the location Sid is at any given moment, and he immediately changes direction from horizontal to vertical (or vice versa). The type of barrier placed determines if he bounces up/down or left/right. Once Sid hits a barrier, it changes direction, so the next time Sid hits it, it will send him in the opposite direction. It is possible to create an unwinnable situation, so if Sid hits ten barriers in a row without hitting the prize, a signature llama will plod across the screen clearing any barriers in the way. Various enemies and hazards appear along the way that have detrimental effect on Sid's progress. Grud the droid will plonk towards every time Sid hits a barrier and a collision is fatal. Hitting a prize will reset the location of Grud.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jeff Minter", "publishers": "LLamasoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflex", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/155412-superdeflex\n"}
