{"altername_name": [], "name": "3D Combat Zone", "overview": "3D Combat Zone is a 1st-person tank hunting game similar to Atari's BattleZone which takes place on a vast plain scattered with pyramids. It transports the player into the valleys of Lacentra, now a battlefield occupied with the spoils of a centenary war battled between two opposite factions. The player is in charge of commanding a special tank and the only left from a vanquished fleet. The solitary vehicle is equipped with a radar system and provided with a mighty cannon loaded with heavy piercing shells. The cannon is reloaded every time one of the shells hits something or goes through the maximum possible distance. It faces the remnant of the enemy fleet which still commands three types of vehicles: normal tanks, hovering saucers and super tanks.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jon Ritman", "publishers": "Aackosoft", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.84", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA8ft_TivfA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/95218-3d-combat-zone\n"}
