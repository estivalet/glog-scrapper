{"altername_name": [], "name": "Who Dares Wins II", "overview": "Armed at the outset with an automatic rifle and 5 grenades, make your way forward to the enemy occupied territory where the opposing battalions are entrenched in occupied townships and the surrounding districts. The occupation army has formed itself into garrisons where they hold prisoners from your own patriotic forces. Press onward to the first enemy garrison avoiding enemy snipers and hidden obstacles on the way, until you are confronted by the walled compound from which will pour the defending troops. Kill off this attack and you gain entry to the next sector of the enemy territory in search of the next garrison of prisoners. But beware the terrain has changed, the dangers have altered. And on you must battle, clearing your way to the final garrison in the 8th territory where victory should be yours until you learn that your back up forces have lost their hold on your first conquest. And so you must return to reclaim the territories the enemy have regained but this time you'll find they're wise to your bravery and the encounters will be even more fierce, the dangers even more cunning.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Alligata Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/82782-who-dares-wins-ii\n"}
