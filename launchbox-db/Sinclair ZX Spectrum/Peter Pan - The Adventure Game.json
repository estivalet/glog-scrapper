{"altername_name": ["Peter Pan"], "name": "Peter Pan: The Adventure Game", "overview": "In this classic adventure, YOU play the part of Peter Pan and your computer will transport you to the magic world of Neverland... As in the book, your adventure begins in the children's nursery. You must fulfil your tasks there before your journey begins. Only be reading the book can you hope to succeed in your ultimate aim - to destroy the evil Captain Hook and steal his ship so that Wendy and the boys can return safely home. The computer will describe and in some cases illustrate your locations and list the things you can see. It will then ask \"What now?\" which tells you that it is waiting for a command. These commands are simply typed in, usually one or two words are all that is necessary e.g. \"CLIMB TREE\" rather than \"CLIMB UP THE TREE\". You will find that discovering which words to use and how to use them is part of the fun. If you don't get the response you want, try different words or the same words in a different way. You will encounter other characters on your journeys, most of them are dangerous, but can be avoided if you know how. It is wise to be careful if you are unarmed. Only by reading the book and exploring with great care, can you hope to succeed, but remember you may need help at the end.
