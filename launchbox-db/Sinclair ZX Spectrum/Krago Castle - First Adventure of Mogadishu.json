The Upper two floors of the castle contain in various locations, all the items required to gain access to the treasure room in the dungeons below. Some of the artifacts found, although needed later, are cumbersome to carry around and they tend to adversely affect your retrieval in a different room - but be warned, more than one item on the floor in any room can attract the attention of passing monsters and will consequently disappear.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX Spectrum", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "A.S.
