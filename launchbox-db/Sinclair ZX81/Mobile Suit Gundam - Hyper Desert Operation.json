{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mobile Suit Gundam: Hyper Desert Operation", "overview": "Hyper Desert Operation can be considered a \"twin game\" of Mobile Suit Gundam: Hyper Classic Operation. It is nearly identical to the other game in setting, gameplay, and visuals. Like Hyper Classic Operation, the game consists of two major campaigns, 0079 and 0087, corresponding to two famous wars in Gundam universe. The player can once again choose between a linear progression through a campaign and individual scenarios within each. The scenarios themselves, however, are completely different. Unlike Hyper Classic Operation, all the scenarios take place on planet surfaces rather than in space. As the title suggests, desert terrain plays indeed an important role; however, some of the scenarios are set in grassland areas, sometimes surrounded by water, etc. The game also features different unit types and places a stronger emphasis on base defense and management.", "platform": "Fujitsu FM Towns Marty", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Family Soft", "publishers": "Family Soft", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/134739-mobile-suit-gundam-hyper-desert-operation\n"}
