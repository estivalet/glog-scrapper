{"altername_name": ["Nova: Miirareta Shitai"], "name": "Nova", "overview": "The protagonist of the game awakens in the cryogenic chamber of a spaceship, unable to remember anything from his past and only vaguely recalling his name. Something strange is happening on board the ship, and it is possible that unknown creatures have found their way into it. The protagonist meets other crew members and together they try to find out what exactly is going on. Nova is a visual novel. The player has a limited ability to move between various parts of the ship via a map, as well as occasionally make decisions and choose dialogue lines during conversations. All these choices alter the course of the storyline, unlock different scenes, influence the hero's relationship with the predominantly female crew, and change the game's ending.", "platform": "Fujitsu FM Towns Marty", "release_date": "July 30, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Cat's Pro", "publishers": "Cat's Pro", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/144669-nova\n"}
