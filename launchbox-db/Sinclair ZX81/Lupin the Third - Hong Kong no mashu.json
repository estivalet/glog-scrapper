The central character is the grandson of the fictional \"gentleman thief\" Ars\u00e8ne Lupin, who follows the same profession, traveling in search of riches and adventure with his companion Daisuke Jigen, an expert marksman. Joining them in this episode is Goemon Ishikawa XIII, a descendant of the legendary Japanese swordsman. Finding themselves in Hong Kong for different reasons, the heroes encounter an evasive and mysterious character with a dark past who crosses their paths and forces them to take action. The game consists of two stories accessible from the main menu. In the first the player controls Jigen, while the protagonist of the second is Ishikawa. The game's structure resembles that of a visual novel: the gameplay is mostly restricted to selecting the right choice among several available ones. These decision prompts are fairly frequent, and making the wrong choice would sometimes lead to Game Over. In addition, in the beginning of each chapter the player must select three items from a list, which will become available as valid choices during correspondent scenes.", "platform": "Fujitsu FM Towns Marty", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "High Tech Laboratory Japan", "publishers": "CSK Research Institute", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/132659-lupin-the-third-hong-kong-no-mashu\n"}
