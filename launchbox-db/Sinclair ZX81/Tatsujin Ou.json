{"altername_name": ["Tatsujin \u014c", "Tatsujin Oh"], "name": "Tatsujin Ou", "overview": "Volcanic eruptions have been occurring on a deserted planet somewhere in deep space for quite some time. Then, on a fateful day, they culminated in a gigantic explosion, and a terrifying creature appeared. It is the emperor of the Gidans, thought to be defeated in the last galactic war. Now, the threat is back: the Gidans army is quickly assembled, and in a short time they dominate the galaxy again. Only a handful of refugees escape to deliver the news to the astroport. A pilot navigating the HyperFighter One aircraft is sent to stop the Gidans once and for all. Like its predecessor, Tatsujin Ou (also known as Truxton II) is a vertically scrolling shooter. The gameplay is very similar to that of the first game: the player-controlled aircraft has three basic weapons (distinguished by the colors of corresponding power-ups) and bombs at his disposal. The rest of the power-ups are also the same as in the first game: increasing the ship's speed, the amount of bombs, and the lives of the player characters. A special power-up can also summon two wingmen to fight alongside the hero. Beside the single-player mode, the game also includes co-op multiplayer.", "platform": "Fujitsu FM Towns Marty", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "ToaPlan", "publishers": "Ving", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.3", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truxton_II", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/n8ivCZHIRl0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/134380-tatsujin-ou\n"}
