Fred, your pet android, informs you that the cruiser is on a Humanoid slave mission, its aim to seek out Humanoid planets from which samples are taken and their brains replaced by microchips. Your aim is to free your ship by pressing the control button in the main computer room. Of course, expect various hazards and puzzles to be in your way.
