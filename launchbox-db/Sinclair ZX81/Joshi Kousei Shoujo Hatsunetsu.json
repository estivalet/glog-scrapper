{"altername_name": [], "name": "Joshi Kousei Shoujo Hatsunetsu", "overview": "Joshi K\u014dsei Sh\u014djo Hatsunetsu is an erotic game with digitized pictures of Japanese models posing as schoolgirls. The game consists of three modes. The first mode allows the player to view profiles and photos of twelve models (five photos per model). These photos are sexually suggestive, but contain no nudity. It is possible to interact with the pictures by moving a hand-shaped cursor over them. The second mode is a photo-shooting simulation game in which the player chooses one of the four available models as well as one of the several photographers, each with their own parameters. The session is timed and the photographer has to choose the right things to say in order to keep the girl in a good mood. Erotic photos (this time with partial nudity) can be then taken and saved to an album. The third mode is a simple sex simulation game. The player chooses between two young women, selects a few conditions for the sex scene, and then presses various keys to stimulate the woman. There is, however, no explicit sex situations in the game, the viewing area consisting only of a digitized photo of a semi- or fully nude woman.", "platform": "Fujitsu FM Towns Marty", "release_date": "December 1, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Byakuya-Shobo", "publishers": "Byakuya-Shobo", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/155281-joshi-kousei-shoujo-hatsunetsu\n"}
