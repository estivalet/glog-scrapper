{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Invaders", "overview": "Invaders is a Space Invaders clone not to be confused with the other game called Invaders for the ZX81. The game plays like any other version of the shoot 'em up with the player moving his laser base along the bottom of the screen while shooting at the aliens that move back and forth above him. Four barriers offer some protection from the enemy fire and sometimes a saucer worth extra points moves across the screen. The game ends when the player has been destroyed three times or the aliens land on the base line.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX-81", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/125483-the-invaders\n"}
