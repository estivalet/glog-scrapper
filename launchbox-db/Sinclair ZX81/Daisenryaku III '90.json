{"altername_name": [], "name": "Daisenryaku III '90", "overview": "Daisenryaku III '90 is an enhanced version of Daisenryaku III: Great Commander featuring significantly improved operation speed and a better interface. Daisenryaku III: Great Commander is a turn-based war strategy game. Like its predecessor, it allows up to four players to compete against each other or computer AI in various war scenarios, controlling armies distinguished by their colors (blue, red, green, and yellow). There are ten maps to choose from, some of which are based on real-world locations and depict historical conflicts, e.g. Russia and Japan fighting over islands in the North Pacific ocean; there are, however, no detailed reconstructions of historical battles, and all sides in all scenarios use the same modern types of weapons and vehicles. The gameplay system remains mostly unchanged compared to the second installment; differences mostly involve larger maps, interface tweaks, different degrees of zooming, etc.", "platform": "Fujitsu FM Towns Marty", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "SystemSoft", "publishers": "Pegasus Japan Corp.", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138074-daisenryaku-iii-90\n"}
