{"altername_name": ["The Tomb of Dracula", "Tomb of Dracula"], "name": "The Tomb of Dracula!", "overview": "The Tomb of Dracula is an arcade adventure where the aim is to explore vaults over various levels of Dracula's Tomb to find the Vampire's Treasure worth half a million pounds. At the start of the game you are presented, for a limited time, a map of the first level of 300 vaults showing all the obstacles, monsters and stakes which needs memorizing before it disappears. You move about in a North, South, East or West direction which is shown in a 1st person perspective. You are then told what is in that vault every time you move into it. As well as the empty vaults, you will discover there are also zombies and ghouls which will need killing with your limited supply of stakes to move on. Slime pits are there to be fallen into and once again stakes are needed to survive. To help you there are vaults full of stakes because if you don't have enough stakes then it is game over. After 30 minutes of exploring, Dracula himself will wake up and stand in the vault next to you. As you move, he will follow and clear the room of any stakes if any are in there. If you walk into a vault containing Dracula then he needs to be killed, but he will rise again and place himself next to your vault again. Occasionally you will be presented with the choice to look at the map again, but this will cost you stakes if you choose to look. To move onto the next level, you have to find a staircase and this will also give you extra stakes.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX-81", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Moviedrome Video", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/167414-the-tomb-of-dracula\n"}
