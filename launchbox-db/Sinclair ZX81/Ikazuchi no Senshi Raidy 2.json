{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ikazuchi no Senshi Raidy 2", "overview": "Lightning Warrior Raidy II combines traditional turn-based battle with elements of visual novels. Unlike its predecessor, it uses limited animation for some scenes instead of simple static images. Maps, which had to be located in the first game, are now automatically created as Raidy progresses through a dungeon. There are new equipment types, items, skills such as Extasy Slash, weapons including the ultimate Sexcalibur, and gameplay elements such as commerce, dual-wielding weapons, and a new charge-based Thunder Slash special attack called Thunder Blast. All fights in the game are one-on-one. Whenever the protagonist Raidy defeats a boss, she punishes them through various kinds of sexual violation and the bosses too rape her in case if they win. Defeating a regular female enemy also shows her undressed and humiliated.", "platform": "Fujitsu FM Towns Marty", "release_date": "March 22, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "ZyX", "publishers": "ZyX", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Warrior_Raidy_II:_~Temple_of_Desire~", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/95240-ikazuchi-no-senshi-raidy-2\n"}
