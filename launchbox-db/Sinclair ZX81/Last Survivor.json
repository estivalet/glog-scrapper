{"altername_name": [], "name": "Last Survivor", "overview": "Last Survivor is one of the earliest 3D third-person shooters, it involves players traversing a maze shooting at opponents. The game consists of 20 levels and the goal is to collect four keys and then head towards the exit. There are 7 other human characters running around, in addition to various non-human enemies. Keys can be obtained by killing other players while non-human enemies drop gold, which can be used in the shop to purchase stronger weapons and armor as well as increase the player's moving speed or regain health. The player's character is rendered as a black wireframe and is viewed from behind. The screen is divided into halves (vertical split-screen), with two players being able to play on the same screen. Up to four arcade cabinets could be linked up, allowing eight players altogether, making it one of the first shooters with a network multiplayer deathmatch mode. The FM Towns port supports 4-players via serial crossover cable, or 2-players via direct dial modem.", "platform": "Fujitsu FM Towns Marty", "release_date": "November 16, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "CSK Research Institute", "publishers": "CSK Research Institute", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/134687-last-survivor\n"}
