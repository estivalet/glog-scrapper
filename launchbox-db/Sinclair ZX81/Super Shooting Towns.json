{"altername_name": [], "name": "Super Shooting Towns", "overview": "Super Shooting Towns is a fairly simple horizontally-scrolling shooter. The player controls a flying mechanical bug-like device that has to fight its way through levels populated by various organic (predominantly insect-like) creatures. There is no permanent secondary weapon, and the relatively infrequent power-ups may either switch the properties of the main weapon temporarily or enhance it (e.g. enable backwards shooting). The game's stand-out feature is the included editor. This utility allows players to design and customize their own side-scrolling shooter levels. It is possible to draw maps as well as change the parameters of the enemies, affecting the difficulty of the stage.", "platform": "Fujitsu FM Towns Marty", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Amorphous", "publishers": "Amorphous", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/134378-super-shooting-towns\n"}
