{"altername_name": ["De.FaNa"], "name": "De. FaNa", "overview": "A young boy with spiky purple hair lies on the ground, contemplating the clear sky. He enjoys the well-deserved rest. Life is good. The only problem is... he can't remember who he is. Finally, after some efforts, he recalls his name: Luck. Profession: adventurer. He was supposed to meet his partner, a sexy girl named Sue, but instead ended up in some sort of a magical land, with zombies and angry female warriors. Soon he will learn that the land is called De FaNa, is ruled by a queen, and contains plenty of dangerous quests for an adventurer... and pretty girls for a horny teenager! De. FaNa plays like a typical Japanese adventure, with the interaction reduced to menu-based choices, all of which depend on the context. Only in a few cases will a wrong choice lead to premature end of the game; most of the time, the player is required to try different choices until the right one triggers the next event. Unlike most other Japanese adventures, many of the screens the player sees in De. FaNa are animated. This includes Luck's numerous sexual encounters with female characters.", "platform": "Fujitsu FM Towns Marty", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Himeya Soft, Inc", "publishers": "Himeya Soft, Inc", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/134102-de-fana\n"}
