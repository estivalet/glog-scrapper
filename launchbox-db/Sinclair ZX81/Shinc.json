{"altername_name": [], "name": "Shinc", "overview": "The plot of Shinc is as simple as its title: the hero - aptly named Hero Narcissus - is a lone adventurer in search of a job. He arrives at a town which is populated mostly by young sexy women. The hero hasn't even enough money to visit the local brothel. Since the king hasn't asked him to rescue a princess (yet), his first quest, given to him by the pretty weapon shop owner, is to venture into a nearby cave, \"Realm of Anguish\", to defeat the monsters lurking there and retrieve valuable items. Naturally, this is just the beginning of a long career, which involves saving the kingdom and becoming a true hero. The gameplay of Shinc is also very unpretentious: it's a first-person dungeon crawler with a basic combat system. Enemies pop up randomly, and the player inputs general commands (\"Auto\", \"Offense\", etc.) to deal with them in turn-based fashion. As per RPG rule, player characters gain experience points and money from fallen enemies, advancing in levels. In towns there is no physical movement, and interaction is done through command menu. There are scenes with nudity and sexual situations in the game.", "platform": "Fujitsu FM Towns Marty", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Libido", "publishers": "Libido", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138316-shinc\n"}
