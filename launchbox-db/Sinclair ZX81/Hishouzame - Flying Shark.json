With that (you can get more lives at certain point intervals, and more bombs can be found), you, the \"Sky Shark\" of your squadron, blast through five levels of enemy-infested battlefields with as many as six gun upgrades (Aside from the bombs and the gun upgrade, there are no other weapons to be found at all). Includes three difficulty levels and two-player support.", "platform": "Fujitsu FM Towns Marty", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "ToaPlan", "publishers": "Ving", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Shark", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/g4edHvDoVLY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138362-hishouzame-flying-shark\n"}
