The protagonist is a cat named Neko-kun (which translates simply to \"Cat\"), who lives on a beautiful island together with his animal and human friends. The opening episode describes his encounter with a little star that fell on the Earth and injured itself. Afterwards, the player can explore the island by selecting locations on the map.
