Most people dismiss this situation since apparently it won't collide with us, however a group of scientists scramble to develop a way to stop this comet. Whether they want to destroy it, divert it, or whatever is unknown however, and you are charged with the task to find out what really is going on. The game is viewed from a first person perspective and progresses as an adventure game, where the emphasis is to explore and discover rather than solve puzzles (this seems to be the Japanese concept of an adventure game) so ultimately it is not so much of a game as it is more an interactive \"tour de force\".", "platform": "Fujitsu FM Towns Marty", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Synergy", "publishers": "Toshiba-EMI", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.25", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadget_Invention,_Travel,_%26_Adventure", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138140-gadget-invention-travel-adventure\n"}
