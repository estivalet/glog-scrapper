{"altername_name": [], "name": "Premium", "overview": "Premium consists of four scenarios, each one of which is dedicated entirely to sex (sometimes with a bit of conversation and very straight-forward seduction before). There is no real story, just a series of encounters of nameless protagonists with different types of young women. Each of the four scenarios is dedicated to a specific occupation, which are: school girl, maid, magician, and finally Buddhist nun. The gameplay is very simple; even though there are verb commands, they are always situation-specific, and the player can advance the game by going through the few commands to trigger the next scene, which makes Premium more of a visual novel than an adventure.", "platform": "Fujitsu FM Towns Marty", "release_date": "September 17, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Silky's", "publishers": "Silky's", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138278-premium\n"}
