{"altername_name": [], "name": "Lunar rescue", "overview": "Lunar Rescue is a clone of Taito's arcade game of the same name. The aim of the game is to evacuate humanoids from the surface of a moon. From a mothership at the top of the screen, the player drops lunar modules that he has to safely land on the moon's three landing platforms. This works similar to Lunar Lander, but here the player has to navigate his way through an asteroid storm. The player can steer left and right and use the thrust to hover in the air. Once the player has landed successfully, the humanoids will enter the module and the player takes off again. But now the scenario has changed. Above him, he will find waves of aliens that drop bombs. To survive, the player has to dodge the alien ships and make it back to the mothership. Now thrust isn't available any more. Instead, the player can use a gun to shoot at the aliens. There are six groups of humanoids. The player gets points for each successful landing and each alien shot down. When the last humanoid has been rescued, the player gets bonus points for every one he has managed to bring back. Bonus points are also awarded based on the amount of fuel that remains. For each group that has been rescued, the game goes on with increased difficulty and bonuses.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX-81", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mikro-Gen", "publishers": "Mikro-Gen", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/162900-lunar-rescue\n"}
