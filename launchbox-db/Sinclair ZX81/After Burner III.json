{"altername_name": [], "name": "After Burner III", "overview": "After Burner III (\u30a2\u30d5\u30bf\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u30ca\u30fcIII) is an aircraft combat game developed by Sega for the Sega Mega-CD and FM Towns. It is a port of Strike Fighter, which only saw release in Japanese arcades, adding a CD audio soundtrack (with the addition of music from After Burner II) and cinematic sequences. As Strike Fighter was actually a sequel to G-LOC: Air Battle, it does not have a third person perspective view like After Burner and After Burner II. After Burner III adds this view as an option.", "platform": "Fujitsu FM Towns Marty", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "CRI", "publishers": "CRI", "genres": "Flight Simulator", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.68", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zJVR6DjtNA&ab_channel=PepAlacant", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/74832-after-burner-iii\n"}
