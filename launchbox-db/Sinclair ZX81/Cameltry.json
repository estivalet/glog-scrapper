{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cameltry", "overview": "There's a kind of knick-knack you may find in dusty games rooms, a maze through which you navigate a marble by subtly tilting the board, dancing with gravity and momentum, deftly rolling your sphere out of dead ends and around the obstacles posed by holes in the board. Marble Madness explores this theme in a fudged 3-D perspective, Cloud Kingdoms in a flat 2-D one -- both by directly influencing the actions of the ball. The game takes a different approach toward a similar end; instead of moving the ball around the board, you move the board around the ball.", "platform": "Fujitsu FM Towns Marty", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Taito", "publishers": "Dempa Shimbunsha", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameltry", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/134824-cameltry\n"}
