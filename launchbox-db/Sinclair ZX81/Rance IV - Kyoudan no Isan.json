{"altername_name": [], "name": "Rance IV: Kyoudan no Isan", "overview": "Hundreds of years ago, the Master of Magic decided to use his immense power to bring peace to mankind and to annihilate the demons on the Earth once and for all. In a grand battle that lasted thirty-two years, his army defeated the demonic forces. However, as always in such cases, something went terribly wrong. Now the one who must correct things is Rance, a young warrior with nothing but sex in mind. As always, with the aid of his lovely slave Sill, Rance will prevail in his fight against darkness... but not necessarily against his libido! As with all the other Rance games, this is a Japanese-style role-playing game with explicit graphical sex scenes (non-animated). Similar to the previous game, the view in towns is first person and navigation is done by choosing commands from a menu. Dungeons are top-down and battles take place on separate battle screens, on which the player's party can freely move and execute attacks in turn-based fashion.", "platform": "Fujitsu FM Towns Marty", "release_date": "March 15, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Alice Soft", "publishers": "Alice Soft", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rance_(series)#Rance_IV_%E2%80%93_Legacy_of_the_Sect_%E2%80%93", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138299-rance-iv-kyoudan-no-isan\n"}
