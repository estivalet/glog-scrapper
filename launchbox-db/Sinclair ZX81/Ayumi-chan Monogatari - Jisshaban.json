{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ayumi-chan Monogatari: Jisshaban", "overview": "Ayumi-chan Monogatari: Jisshaban is almost exactly the same game as Ayumi-chan Monogatari, with one important difference: it has photos of a real actress replacing the original's anime-style graphics. There are no graphics at all in the game. This is the only difference between the two versions. The photos of the actress mimic the original graphics very closely, including not only locations, expressions, etc., but also sexual poses. The text and the gameplay process are identical to the original version.", "platform": "Fujitsu FM Towns Marty", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Alice Soft", "publishers": "Core Magazine", "genres": "Life Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137746-ayumi-chan-monogatari-jisshaban\n"}
