{"altername_name": [], "name": "Maze Death Race", "overview": "Maze Death Race is a Rally-X variant. The player controls a car and has to drive around a maze and collect a certain number of flags to complete a level. At the same time other cars chase the player's car and attempt to hit it. The number of cars are user defined in the ZX81 version and pre-defined in the ZX Spectrum version. In addition to chaser cars there are various traps on the roads that the player has to avoid hitting such as rocks, oil and ice. Unlike the original arcade game, in this version the player can not use a smoke screen to confuse the chasers. Both versions allow the player to choose the speed of the AI cars. In the ZX81 version it is also possible to choose if the car should have momentum while in the Spectrum version this is always the case.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX-81", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "PSS", "publishers": "PSS", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/125527-maze-death-race\n"}
