{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pro Student G", "overview": "By the end of the 20th century, radical educational reforms have transformed the Japanese society. Students were split into opposing groups, and the more aggressive of those eventually formed a dominant organization named Order of Black Phoenix, centered on the cult of a mysterious person known as \"The Queen\". Outcast students have escaped to a secluded island near Okinawa. A wandering lazy and lecherous manga and anime fan named Gor\u014d End\u014d teams up with a female teacher and a few students to lead an opposition force against the oppressive governing circles. Pro Student G is a Japanese-style erotic comedy adventure. The player guides Gor\u014d through a series of locations and encounters, selecting choices from a menu to trigger the next event and advance the story. Some choices have a traditional verb-object structure, while others incorporate context-specific actions, many of which are included for humorous effect.", "platform": "Fujitsu FM Towns Marty", "release_date": "August 15, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Alice Soft", "publishers": "Alice Soft", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138280-pro-student-g\n"}
