{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mazeman", "overview": "Mazeman is a Pac-Man clone. Like in the original arcade game the player has to make his way through a maze, collect all the dots while avoiding the ghosts (here called hobgoblins) that chase him. There are also larger dots (here called magic aberswords) that reverse the roles and allow the player to go after the ghosts and gobble them up, but only for a few seconds. This version does not have any fruit. Once all dots have been collected the level is completed. The player earns points for eating dots and ghosts. The value of the ghosts increases for each additional one eaten. The game ends when all three lives have been lost.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX-81", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Abersoft", "publishers": "Abersoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/125491-mazeman\n"}
