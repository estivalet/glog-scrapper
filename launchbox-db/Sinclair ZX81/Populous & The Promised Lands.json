To win, you must help your chosen people take over the world and wipe out the vermin who worship that other god. Each god starts out with a single human, dumped into the middle of the wilderness. Sometimes there is inhabitable land in sight, sometimes not. To get a chance to win, you must change the landscape, creating flat land for your followers to build on. The more followers you have, the more powerful you will be, so take care of them. Build as fast as you can, because the other god is doing the same. POPULOUS: THE PROMISED LANDS The Promised Lands adds five new landscape types: Wild West, Silly Land, Block Land, R\u00e9volution Fran\u00e7aise and Bit Plains.", "platform": "Fujitsu FM Towns Marty", "release_date": "July 27, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Bullfrog Productions", "publishers": "Imagineer", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populous_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/134615-populous-the-promised-lands\n"}
