{"altername_name": [], "name": "Iris Tei Serenade", "overview": "Iris Tei Serenade is set in a medieval fantasy land. For seven years, the two most powerful countries - the Empire of Aimar and the Kingdom of Langbard - have been at war with each other. In order to secure the victory, the people of Aimar turned to Imar, their hero and guardian angel. Imar's mission is to infiltrate the Langbard kingdom. However, once he arrives there and stays at the inn run by three young and lovely sisters, his mind turns into a direction quite different from war and politics... The game is a traditional Japanese adventure, without puzzles, physical movement, or any interaction beside menu-based commands. The usual verb commands are the standard \"Look\", \"Talk\", \"Think\", and \"Move\", though other, context-specific command might appear on different screens as well. Most of the commands lead to sub-menus of objects. The player typically has to exhaust the command tree to trigger the next scene. At some points, the player can make decisions that will trigger different scenes. There are scenes with nudity and suggested sexual situations, though they are infrequent and rather \"softcore\".", "platform": "Fujitsu FM Towns Marty", "release_date": "December 16, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Agumix", "publishers": "Agumix", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138180-iris-tei-serenade\n"}
