{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ayumi-chan Monogatari", "overview": "The premise of Ayumi-chan Monogatari is rather simple: the protagonist, a young boy named Kouichi, is in love with the most beautiful girl in his school, Ayumi Kawai. One day she admits that she also loves him, and they begin a relationship. The game starts when the two are already together, and is dedicated entirely to their dates - which consist mostly of sex. The game can be therefore considered a basic dating/sex simulation. Kouichi and Ayumi meet everyday, and the player, controlling Kouichi, can sometimes decide where they go - though the interaction is quite limited. The player can also choose sex-related commands during the intimate part of their date, raising Ayumi's pleasure meter and unlocking new pictures.", "platform": "Fujitsu FM Towns Marty", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Alice Soft", "publishers": "Alice Soft", "genres": "Life Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137745-ayumi-chan-monogatari\n"}
