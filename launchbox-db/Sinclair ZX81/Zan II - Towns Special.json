{"altername_name": [], "name": "Zan II: Towns Special", "overview": "Zan II: Towns Special is an installment in the Zan series primarily based on Zan: Kager\u014d no Toki. The setting (Japanese Sengoku period) and main gameplay mechanics are identical. However, this version allows the player to recreate specific scenarios from the historical era, taking place between 1550 and 1600. Four scenarios of varied difficulty are available. Like other Zan games, this entry is a turn-based grand strategy game similar to Koei's Romance of the Three Kingdoms series. The player takes control of a ruler or general in a chosen province of Japan, trying to govern his own country by keeping its inhabitants happy, and gaining the upper hand in the struggle for dominance, be it through diplomatic manoeuvres or military actions. Combat takes place on separate isometric screens and allows the player to input detailed commands for the army.", "platform": "Fujitsu FM Towns Marty", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Wolf Team", "publishers": "Wolf Team", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138355-zan-ii-towns-special\n"}
