{"altername_name": [], "name": "Viper V12", "overview": "Yet another entry in the Viper series, Viper V-12 exploits the same format all the previous entries followed: there are three unrelated short stories which mostly consist of animated sex scenes, with some interaction here and there. Here are the stories: Future Investigator Bravan: Bravan is a powerful warrior clad in power armor, who fights for human beings in and has only one weakness: his pretty female comrades. A group of demons called \"Donar\", led by the mischievous female doppelganger Colonel Gel, decide to use the shape-shifting powers of the commander to lure Bravan to their lair. Angel Dust: Kate and Julia, two cosmic rangers, attack a space pirate ship and board it, hoping to steal treasures and to become rich. But they were not careful enough when they entered the ship without any precautions: the space pirates had other plans for the young girls... Magical Gambler: A young child has a dream which becomes reality: two cute flying creatures appear in front of her and give her a magic rod. However, when the girl uses the rod, she miraculously turns into a young and sexy woman. She decides to use the powers of the rod for her own greed, and becomes Chiyomi - the Queen of Gambling... This time, all three stories have some interactive parts, although they are more developed in \"Bravan\" than in the others, which are very straight-forward. \"Bravan\" offers a short sequence which requires the player to move the mouse or arrow keys to spot a target on a picture; there are also several wrong choices that lead to Game Over in this story.", "platform": "Fujitsu FM Towns Marty", "release_date": "December 15, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Sogna", "publishers": "Sogna", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138346-viper-v12\n"}
