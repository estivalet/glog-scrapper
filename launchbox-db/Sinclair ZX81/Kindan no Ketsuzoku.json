His father had worked for a big corporation before he died; its owner, a very wealthy woman named Reiko Hayami, decides to give the poor boy a new home. As Ken enters his new residence, he is pleasantly surprised to discover that from now on he will share a house with Mrs. Hayami's five young and beautiful daughters. But not all is simple - soon the young hero will find himself involved in complex relationships he would actually prefer not to have... Kindan no Ketsuzoku (Fatal Relations) plays like a typical Japanese adventure. The player reads text, views non-animated pictures, and chooses verb commands from a menu (\"Look\", Talk\", etc.). Navigation in the house is also performed by selecting a specific location from a menu. Different cutscenes will be triggered depending on where the player decides to go, and how he handles the various encounters with the young women.", "platform": "Fujitsu FM Towns Marty", "release_date": "June 17, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "C's Ware", "publishers": "C's Ware", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138803-kindan-no-ketsuzoku\n"}
