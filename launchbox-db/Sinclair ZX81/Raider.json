{"altername_name": [], "name": "Raider", "overview": "Raider is a Scramble clone with ASCII graphics that has you flying over the surface of a planet before flying through a cavern bombing the installations and missile dumps. As you fly, missiles and aliens will fly towards you and you can either bomb them or use your laser. You are able to move your craft up or down, and left or right to avoid the missiles and aliens as well. If you hit a missile, alien or the planet's surface then you lose one of three lives. A fuel gauge decreases as you fly but you can increase it by bombing fuel dumps.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX-81", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Artic Computing", "publishers": "Artic Computing", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/147420-raider\n"}
