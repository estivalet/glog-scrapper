In the second story, a seventeen-year-old modern-day girl named Ryoko is magically transferred to a parallel world known as Ryudo. There, she receives painful sexual \"training\" ans is send to battle machine enemies. The third story is set in American Old West and focuses on Marie, a female rogue who wants to pass for a young man. The rest of the plot depicts various sexual encounters of hers with men and women, consensual and non-consensual alike. The gameplay is nearly identical to that of the previous game, with rudimentary interaction consisting of three choices that often have to be repeated in order to trigger the next event. A few choices may lead to different endings. Like its predecessor, the game is heavy on explicit sexual scenes, many of which are animated.", "platform": "Fujitsu FM Towns Marty", "release_date": "September 29, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "ZyX", "publishers": "ZyX", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/140755-trigger-2\n"}
