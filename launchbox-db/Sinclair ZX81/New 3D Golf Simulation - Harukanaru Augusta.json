The interface consists of three windows: the 3D window where the golfer and the ball movement is shown, an overhead map of the hole and a status window which shows where the ball is (e.g. on the green) and the wind direction. The controls follow the usual formula: first the player sets the used club, the feet position and the direction of the shot. Then the power (a moving line on a scale) and the drift (a moving dot on a golf ball) is determined by clicking with the correct timing to stop the line respectively dot.", "platform": "Fujitsu FM Towns Marty", "release_date": "January 26, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "T&E Soft", "publishers": "T&E Soft", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138270-new-3d-golf-simulation-harukanaru-augusta\n"}
