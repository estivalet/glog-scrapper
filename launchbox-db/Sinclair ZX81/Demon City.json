{"altername_name": [], "name": "Demon City", "overview": "On the continent of Barnhedge, there lies a kingdom named Vagrand. The inhabitants of the country are followers of what they call the \"True Religion\", which teaches them, quite simply, to enjoy life in all possible ways, without controlling their desires and lust. As a result, the capital of Vagrand became the center of corporeal pleasures, and its neighbors started calling it the \"Demon City\". The player controls a Vagrand knight who is sent by the princess Leticia on a confident mission. But intrigues and uncontrolled lust surround the hero everywhere: opposition in the palace, a young girl named Milk who wants him all for herself, and the mysterious cult of the Moon are all there to make the hero's life hard... Demon City is a Japanese-style adventure. The interface consists of icons, selectable at any time, which correspond to actions such as Examine, Talk, Move, etc. The player can visit various locations in the city and its surrounding (done by choosing the Move command and a location name from the menu). During sex scenes, the interface changes somewhat, with additional icons for more specific sexual actions.", "platform": "Fujitsu FM Towns Marty", "release_date": "March 18, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Cocktail Soft", "publishers": "Cocktail Soft", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/142858-demon-city\n"}
