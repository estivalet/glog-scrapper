{"altername_name": ["The Queen of Duellist Gaiden Alpha"], "name": "The Queen of Duellist Gaiden \u03b1", "overview": "The Queen of Duellist Gaiden \u03b1 allows the players to select any of the fighters from either The Queen of Duellist or The Queen of Duellist Gaiden. These include characters that were not initially playable in the corresponding games: Ryuhou from the first one, and the antagonists Gold and Takegami from the second. In total, ten characters are available: Miyuki, Emily, Ryuhou (first game), Chizuru, Reika, Kiriko, Mei, Elza, Gold, and Takegami (second game). The gameplay is identical to that of The Queen of Duellist Gaiden; the three characters from the first game have new moves and new home areas at their disposal. Three difficulty levels are available; as in the second game, erotic pictures can be accessed only if the story mode is completed with at least one character on either Normal or Hard (not Easy) level. The versus mode allows two players to compete against each other or computer AI, or let both fighters be AI-controlled and watch the battles.", "platform": "Fujitsu FM Towns Marty", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Agumix", "publishers": "Agumix", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/142867-the-queen-of-duellist-gaiden\n"}
