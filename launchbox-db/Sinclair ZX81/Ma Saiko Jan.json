{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ma Saiko Jan", "overview": "Ma Saiko Jan is a mahjong game with light role-playing elements and a structure reminiscent of board games. The player controls a girl named Saiko who must defeat various magical and demonic creatures in the game of mahjong. Saiko travels on a simple board consisting of various fields; the amount of moves is determined by an invisible dice roll. Landing on different fields leads to different results: Saiko may find treasure, meet a wandering merchant who sells healing potions, or encounter an enemy. Choosing to fight an enemy leads to a mahjong game; winning it increases Saiko's level and hit points.", "platform": "Fujitsu FM Towns Marty", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Cosmos Computer", "publishers": "Cosmos Computer", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/153009-ma-saiko-jan\n"}
