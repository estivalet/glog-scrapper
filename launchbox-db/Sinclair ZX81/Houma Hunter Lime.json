{"altername_name": [], "name": "Houma Hunter Lime", "overview": "A magical world populated by supernatural creatures exists alongside ours. Once in a while a portal between the two opens. Demons known as BEMs (\"big-eyed monsters\") have stolen precious jewels and escaped to Earth through that portal. It is up to two demon hunters, Lime and Bass, to assume the likeness of a teenage girl and boy and restore peace and order. H\u014dma Hunter Lime is the first episode of a series, built like an interactive cartoon with visual novel elements. The interaction is sparse, consisting of repeatedly selecting simple verb commands from a menu and triggering animated cutscenes. In the first episode Bass (controlled by the player) and Lime are trying to stop a BEM who looks like an oversized candle and attempts to turn people into wax statues.", "platform": "Fujitsu FM Towns Marty", "release_date": "June 10, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Silence", "publishers": "Brother Kougyou", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138797-houma-hunter-lime\n"}
