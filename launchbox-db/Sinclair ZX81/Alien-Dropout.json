{"altername_name": ["Alien Dropout", "Drop-Out"], "name": "Alien-Dropout", "overview": "Alien-Dropout is a shoot 'em up based on the arcade game Astro Invader. Earth is once again threatened by aliens, and it's up to the player to stop them. The aliens are launched onto the screen from a mothership that moves across the upper part of the screen. Beneath it are columns which the aliens enter before they attack the player. When hitting the ground, the aliens explode and the player has to stay out of their blast radius. In addition to the regular aliens, there is also a larger kind that appears in the middle of the screen. When this one hits the ground, its blast radius covers the whole ground, and therefore it has to be shot down. The game is over when all three lives have been lost. Before starting a game, the player can change the skill level by altering the speed of the player, aliens and the mothership.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX-81", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Silversoft", "publishers": "Silversoft", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/167412-alien-dropout\n"}
