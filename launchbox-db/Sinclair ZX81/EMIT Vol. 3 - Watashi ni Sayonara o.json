The story mode is the main game divided into chapters where players get to watch the story unfold and can do a number of exercises after each chapter. During the story mode, players can pause the game at any time in order to look up a term they didn't understand or to change the language. The exercises are: Listening comprehension activities where players pick the right options to check their understanding of the story. Guessing what's going to happen where players choose the question that's closest to their opinion and listen to the characters in the story commenting about the player's opinion. Conversation practice where students can listen to the characters speech and act out the dialogues. Exclusive to the third volume is a new English Game called Ghost Sweeper.
