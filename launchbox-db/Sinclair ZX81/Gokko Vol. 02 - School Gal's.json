{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gokko Vol. 02: School Gal's", "overview": "Gokko Vol. 02: School Gal's is very similar in structure to the previous volume, but - as the title implies - with a different theme. The player controls a young male protagonist (default name Lance), who has spotted a beautiful girl near the gate of the prestigious Finlandia Girls High School. He is determined to gain access to the school, which is also attended by his sister. Though men are strictly prohibited from entering the school building, the hero is resourceful enough to find a way in; what happens afterwards should be clear to anyone familiar with the many high school-themed bishoujo games... The game plays very similarly to its predecessor, though the player has somewhat more freedom of choice and options this time. It walks a fine line between a \"normal\" Japanese-style adventure and visual novel, though due to lack of a fixed verb-based command menu it should probably belong to the latter. Most of the choices are there simply to try and see the responses; however, some of them lead to dead-end situations, which eventually result in Game Over.", "platform": "Fujitsu FM Towns Marty", "release_date": "November 30, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mink", "publishers": "Mink", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138135-gokko-vol-02-school-gals\n"}
