{"altername_name": [], "name": "3D 3D!", "overview": "3D 3D! is a maze game where the player simply has to find his way out of the maze. The game is played from a first person perspective and the maze is three dimensional meaning it's designed as a cube with multiple levels. The player starts at the lowest level and has to get to the exit at level 10. A map can be used to show the player's position in the level and it's also possible to show the locations of shafts to the upper levels. A score is calculated based on how many steps the player takes and adds penalties for reading the map.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX-81", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jeff Minter", "publishers": "dk'tronics", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/130373-3d-3d\n"}
