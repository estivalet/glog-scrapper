{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dungeons of Doom", "overview": "Dungeons of Doom is a double games pack with both games playing the same for one to four players but having different scenarios as you step into a deserted castle. In Dungeons of Doom you have to move downwards through the dungeons to find the treasure, while Escape from the Underworld has you falling through the floor and having to move upwards to the entrance to the castle. The games are played on a 10 x 10 cube and on the screen you have a map of your location plus the surrounding areas. You must move around through the corridors and up and down stairs searching rooms that you encounter. There are hazards and creatures who occupy certain rooms and when you encounter a creature you have a short time to decide whether to fight, use a spell or retreat. You have a certain amount of hit points and this reduces with every trap, incident or a fight with the creatures. Each player has one move before the next player has a turn.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX-81", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Simon R.
