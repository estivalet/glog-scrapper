{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ponkan", "overview": "Ponkan consists of three unrelated scenarios. In the first one a young private investigator attempts to unravel a sex-related conspiracy. The second scenario is set in medieval fantasy environment and focuses on two warrior sisters who got captured and thrown into a dungeon by monsters. Finally, the third scenario is dedicated to \"sex fighting\" between young women of various cultural backgrounds. The gameplay is the same in all the scenarios, approaching the visual novel format, though with more choices than it is usually the case with comparable games. Rather than branching the storyline the choices serve simply to trigger new options and subsequently cutscenes, though some may lead to a premature end of the game. The game largely consists of explicit sex scenes. A comic book-like behind-the-stage segment, extended introductions to other products by the same developer, and various art galleries are included.", "platform": "Fujitsu FM Towns Marty", "release_date": "July 15, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Ponytail Soft", "publishers": "Ponytail Soft", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138277-ponkan\n"}
