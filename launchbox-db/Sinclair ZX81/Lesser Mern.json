{"altername_name": [], "name": "Lesser Mern", "overview": "Many years ago, two dragons - red and blue - emerged as the first, primordial creatures of the world. As time passed they evolved into humanoid gods - the man Tarnas and the woman Martia. A battle between the two ensued, and Martia unleashed monsters onto the world. One night, a young swordsman named Tile saw a strange dream, in which he took part in the final cosmic battle between the gods. His father introduces him to King Seva, who interprets the dream as prophecy and sends Tile on a perilous quest to vanquish Martia and her minions. Lesser Mern is a Japanese-style role-playing game. The player navigates Tile and his party on an overhead map, accessing locations (towns and hostile areas) represented by icons. Turn-based combat, leveling up, magic, and equipment system are all done according to the genre's traditions. Enemy encounters are semi-random: after every few steps small whirlwinds appear near the main character, which can be avoided or confronted to initiate combat.", "platform": "Fujitsu FM Towns Marty", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Panther Software", "publishers": "Panther Software", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138197-lesser-mern\n"}
