{"altername_name": ["Muncher"], "name": "Muncher!", "overview": "Muncher! is a Pac Man variant. The main change here is that the booth in the center contains bonus fruit, instead of launching the ghosts, and also a key must be picked up in order to open it and grab the fruit inside. As always, the player must avoid the ghosts and collect the dots, with power-pills available so as to make the ghosts edible, for bonus points and to buy some time.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX-81", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Silversoft", "publishers": "Silversoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/125525-muncher\n"}
