{"altername_name": ["Wyatt: The 4th Unit Series"], "name": "The 4th Unit Series: Wyatt", "overview": "Judge Badnack, one of the few remnants of the WWWF, is determined to restore that criminal organization to former glory. He takes control of the assault satellite belonging to the United Nations, and kidnaps Zero to attain his goal. However, the Einheit organization sends Badnack's ex-lover Arnette Penzias to further their own agenda. Blon-Win and Dalzy must once again use their wits and their bionic powers to rescue Zero and put an end to evil schemes. Wyatt is the seventh entry in The 4th Unit series and a sequel to Merrygoround. Gameplay-wise, it is similar to its immediate predecessor, with presentation and gameplay elements reminiscent of an interactive cartoon. Like in the previous game, the player must select actions within time limit to advance the story, and may run out of \"lives\" if the time limit has been breached or too many wrong choices were made. Unlike the predecessor, possible actions are performed with command icons rather than selection from text menus.", "platform": "Fujitsu FM Towns Marty", "release_date": "April 3, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Data West", "publishers": "Data West", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133545-the-4th-unit-series-wyatt\n"}
