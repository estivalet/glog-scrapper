{"altername_name": [], "name": "Fantasy Games", "overview": "Fantasy Games is a double games pack containing the following adventure games: Perilous Swamp: Deep in a Perilous Swamp, your quest is to find and rescue a Princess held captive by an evil Wizard before escaping out of the swamp. You are presented with a map of your surroundings and text tells you any objects you can see. As you move around the swamp you will encounter various creatures who you can fight, run or bribe (if you have enough treasure). If you choose to fight then you decide how many combat strength points to use. Spells can be found and used to help you on your quest. Sorcerer's Island: Similar to Perilous Swamp, this time you are on an island and you must attempt to get off the island. One difference is you can encounter people like the King of the Dwarves and the Grand Sorcerer himself to help you.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX-81", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Psion Software", "publishers": "Psion Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/102778-fantasy-games\n"}
