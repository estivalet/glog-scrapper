{"altername_name": [], "name": "Arabesque: Shoujo-tachi no Orinasu Ai no Monogatari", "overview": "The story of Arabesque begins in a mysterious way, when a young girl named Alice is approached by a man who calls himself \"K\". The two share a bizarre sexual experience, which Alice finds herself unable to forget afterwards. From now on, she is determined to find the mysterious K. She works in a mansion, serving another mysterious figure, a masked \"Master\", hoping to find clues concerning K's whereabouts by talking to the maids and learning about their own experiences. The gameplay is somewhat in the middle between a regular Japanese adventure and a visual novel, more tending towards the latter. Plenty of text can be scrolled without any input by the player, but for the most time the situation requires active menu-based navigation through the mansion and its surrounding, as well as choice of specific activities and dialogue themes.", "platform": "Fujitsu FM Towns Marty", "release_date": "April 28, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "FairyTale", "publishers": "FairyTale", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/137741-arabesque-shoujo-tachi-no-orinasu-ai-no-monogatari\n"}
