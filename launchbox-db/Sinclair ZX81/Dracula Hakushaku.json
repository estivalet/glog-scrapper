{"altername_name": ["Dracula Hakushaku: Bishoujo-tachi no Chi no Shitatari"], "name": "Dracula Hakushaku", "overview": "Dracula Hakushaku is FairyTale's own take on Bram's Stoker famous story. The powerful vampire Count Dracula returns to his castle, only to find dead bodies of the women he had relationships with in the past. The Count begins to re-create his adventures, remembering all the women he had seduced, killed, or turned into vampires. But his antagonist, the vampire hunter Abraham van Helsing, is retracing his steps as well... Dracula Hakushaku is an adventure game that mostly follows the Japanese template (minimal interaction, no puzzles). Less typically for Japanese adventures, the Count can pick up and carry items, which must be used at certain points in the game. The interaction is performed by selecting icons that represent verb commands, as well as directional arrows for navigation between screens. During the numerous sex scenes, additional icons appear, some of them being of a sexual nature, but also a \"bite\" icon, which allows the protagonist to use his best-known vampire ability on the victim.", "platform": "Fujitsu FM Towns Marty", "release_date": "March 19, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "FairyTale", "publishers": "IDES", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dracula_Hakushaku", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138122-dracula-hakushaku\n"}
