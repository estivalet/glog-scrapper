{"altername_name": [], "name": "Death Brade", "overview": "Death Brade is a versus fighting game with several stand-out features. With the exception of Hercules, playable characters have no names: they either represent a warrior class (Fighter, Amazoness), or are popular mythological beings (Minotaur, Beast, Dragon, and Golem). The game has two modes: single-player, in which the player selects a fighter and competes against computer-controlled opponents in a strict order, and two-player mode, where both players can choose their characters. Unlike most versus fighting games, the battles take place on a square arena instead of the usual horizontal screens. Wrestling moves (such as grappling) are widely utilized. Special energy can be accumulated and then unleashed as powerful attacks.", "platform": "Fujitsu FM Towns Marty", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Data East", "publishers": "KID", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138367-death-brade\n"}
