{"altername_name": ["Stronghold: Emperor no Yousai"], "name": "Stronghold: Koutei no Yousai", "overview": "Mixing the gameplay of Civilization and similar games into real-time and with a 3D view, players must build up a small village in the Dungeons and Dragons fantasy universe into a Stronghold. How much micro-management you wish to do is up to you; the computer can take care of much of it. You recruit and train Fighters, Thieves, Clerics and Magic Users to venture out and claim more land and resources, which include removing hostile forces. Take control of food supply and the production and management of buildings including castles, markets and magic schools. Your victory condition is based on your alignment: Lawful players must advance to the rank of Emperor, Chaotic players must destroy all enemy strongholds, and Neutral players must do both!", "platform": "Fujitsu FM Towns Marty", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Stormfront Studios", "publishers": "Ving", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "0.75", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stronghold_(1993_video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/135091-stronghold-koutei-no-yousai\n"}
