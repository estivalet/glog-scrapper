{"altername_name": ["Misty: Meitantei Toujou"], "name": "Misty", "overview": "Misty is a detective mystery adventure game set in modern-day Japan and starring the young private investigator Ry\u016b Kamishiro. The game consists of nine unrelated cases that can be accessed in any order from the main menu. These cases range from seemingly mundane matters to thefts, mysterious disappearances and murder investigations. This installment in the series differs from the others by introducing full-screen digitized photos for all the locations (as opposed to the text-only majority of other Misty releases). There are also many more unique images instead of generic areas as well as hand-drawn character graphics in many scenes. This release contains all the five cases of Misty Vol.1: Strange Naked Body, Red Fountain, Murderer's Laboratory, Tail Lights Disappearing in the Old City and Decaying Family Tree. In addition, it contains four cases exclusive to this version: Moving Target, The Young Lady's Abduction, Letter from the Red Spider and Final Countdown. The player is presented with a graphical map of locations in the city, and much of the gameplay is dedicated to repeatedly visiting them, searching areas and questioning suspects. The gameplay is somewhat more relenting than in other Misty games, allowing re-visiting more locations without penalties. It is possible to accuse suspects and attempt to solve the case at any point, though doing so without sufficient evidence will result in failure. The game saves the progress automatically; it is possible to restart the investigation only by deleting the save file.", "platform": "Fujitsu FM Towns Marty", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Data West", "publishers": "Data West", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138262-misty\n"}
