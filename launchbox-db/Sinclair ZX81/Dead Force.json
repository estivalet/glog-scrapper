{"altername_name": ["Shinseiki Kouboushi: Dead Force"], "name": "Dead Force", "overview": "In the middle of the continent of Lorelei lies the Karma mountain range, separating two cultures. To the East is the peaceful, rural Canaan federation. To the West is Dardila, the land of monks. The peaceful days of these nations were over when a meteor fell on Dardila, gradually turning the monks evil. A war erupted, and Dardilan forces overrun Canaan. Marion, the crown prince of Canaan, has just turned fourteen, and has to deal with the tremendous responsibility of commanding his army and winning the war. Dead Force is a tactical role-playing game. The entire game consists of large-scale battles between armies. Each unit is represented by a single character icon. The soldiers share hit points, equipment, and levels, and are generally treated like separate characters which can be navigated on the overhead battle screen in turn-based fashion. When a player-controlled unit is adjacent to an enemy one, a battle ensues, which proceeds automatically and is displayed on a separate screen.", "platform": "Fujitsu FM Towns Marty", "release_date": "June 9, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Fuga System", "publishers": "Fuga System", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138108-dead-force\n"}
