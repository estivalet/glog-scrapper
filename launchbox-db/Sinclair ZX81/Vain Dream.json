{"altername_name": [], "name": "Vain Dream", "overview": "The age of peace has come to an end... For many years, the inhabitants of the country Ellzeria enjoyed a peaceful, prosperous life, protected by the goddess Ell. But the island nation of Seljild, led by demonic warlocks, began to conquer one Ellzerian city after another. To protect Duma, the heart of the land, the knight Tristram fought valiantly, but was heavily wounded in battle. Mel, a young female magician from Asrafil, has tended to his wounds, and after three months Tristram is healthy again, ready to enter a decisive battle against the forces of Seljild. Vain Dream is a RPG with traditionally Japanese emphasis on story and characters, as well as simple game mechanics and mostly linear progression. However, combat is handled differently in this game than in most other Japanese RPGs, and similarly to Emerald Dragon (made by the same company); still turn-based, it allows free movement on the battle field, calculating the amount of turns without displaying them, thus creating an illusion of real-time battles. Enemies usually appear in groups and are visibly walking on screen in hostile locations.", "platform": "Fujitsu FM Towns Marty", "release_date": "April 23, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Glodia", "publishers": "Glodia", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/135087-vain-dream\n"}
