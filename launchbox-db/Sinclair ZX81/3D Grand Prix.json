As you accelerate you need to keep an eye on your rev counter, have it too high and your engine will blow and it is race over. As you approach a bend you are told the recommended speed to take the bend and you are updated regularly the weather with updates. As you finish a lap the road surface becomes checkered indicating you can stop your car to use the pits.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX-81", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "M.E.
