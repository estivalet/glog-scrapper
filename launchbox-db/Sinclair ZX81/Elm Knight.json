{"altername_name": ["A Living Body Armor: Elm Knight"], "name": "Elm Knight", "overview": "Elm Knight is set in a futuristic world, dominated by the totalitarian regime of the Empire, which hunts down the so-called \"Irregulars\" - people who have supernatural abilities. The young Rick Chandler is attending the Pilot Academy, where he learns to control giant robots known as \"MPS\". He discovers that he might be in possession of magical abilities (which would make him an Irregular), and escapes to the desert, where he meets a girl named Selena, who directs him to the base of a rebel organization. Joining the rebels, Rick must face his Imperial superiors, some of which are closely related to him... Elm Knight is an action game that mostly focuses on giant robot (\"mech\") combat. The game is set in pseudo-3D maze-like environments (with an auto-map) and is viewed from first-person perspective. Enemies (such as enemy robots) walk around in hostile areas. The playable robot, controlled by Rick, is equipped with projectile weapons of different kinds, with limited ammo. It is also possible to use melee attacks to defeat the opponents. In some areas, Rick is controlled directly (though the view and the interface are the same), and is able to use weapons such as a handgun to defend himself.", "platform": "Fujitsu FM Towns Marty", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Micro Cabin", "publishers": "Micro Cabin", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/VSYizQZu7OY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/134138-elm-knight\n"}
