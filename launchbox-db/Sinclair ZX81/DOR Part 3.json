{"altername_name": [], "name": "DOR Part 3", "overview": "DOR Part 3 is, as the title implies, the third entry in the series. The game's structure is identical to that of the predecessors: three completely unrelated scenarios, which can be accessed from the main menu. The first scenario deals with a young man who is bored working for a company called D.O.. Luckily, on that particular day the company decides to interview a few young and pretty women, and naturally, the hero is glad to jump at that opportunity... The second scenario depicts an average guy on a plane who pretends to be a real hijacker, threatening the passengers and coercing the female flight attendants to perform services of sexual nature for him. The third scenario tells the story of a mad scientist, who has invented a machine that would turn human being into his willing slaves. At first, the scientist decides to use this machine on his cute female assistant, but in an unexpected turn of events, new victims appear... The gameplay in all the scenarios of DOR Part 3 is exactly the same as in the other DOR games: at each screen, the player is given several (usually three or four) choices of actions or responses. Choosing the correct ones (or, as it often happens, going through all the choices several times) triggers the next event, while choosing wrong actions might lead to a Game Over.", "platform": "Fujitsu FM Towns Marty", "release_date": "November 27, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "D.O.
