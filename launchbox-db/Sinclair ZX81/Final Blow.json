{"altername_name": [], "name": "Final Blow", "overview": "Final Blow is an action game based around the sport of boxing. You can play the fighters in a sequence of knock-out competitions, (the computer versions also include a round-robin league). Rounds last one minute, with a short break in between them. As in the real sport, your aim is to knock your opponent down for 10 seconds, by gradually weakening him with a series of punches. You can block punches, to avoid them inflicting damage onto you. The ring is of a limited size, so players can be cornered, although the referee will intervene to break the boxers up if they become entangled in a stalemate position.", "platform": "Fujitsu FM Towns Marty", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Taito", "publishers": "Ving", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.33", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Blow", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/q95oZ-kx9vI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/134682-final-blow\n"}
