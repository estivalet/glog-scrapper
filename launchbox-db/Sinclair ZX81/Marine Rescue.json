{"altername_name": [], "name": "Marine Rescue", "overview": "Your mission is to move to the bottom of the sea to rescue sailors trapped in a stricken sub. You start at the top of the screen with an oxygen level of 60 which decreases and you move downwards while avoiding or shooting sharks that move across the screen. When you reach the bottom, you must enter the sub and bring a sailor out and back to the top of the screen to a safety tank. There is also an oxygen tank that can be entered to top up your levels. If you touch a shark or run out of oxygen then it is game over.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX-81", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "International Publishing & Software Inc.", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/125526-marine-rescue\n"}
