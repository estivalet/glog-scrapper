{"altername_name": [], "name": "Engage Errands: Miwaku no Shitotachi", "overview": "In Engage Errands, the player commands a unit of angelic fighters. These fighters look like pretty girls, but they are all angels, sent by the Goddess onto the Earth to stop a terrible disaster: the evil sorceress Guendola, commanding minions of orcs, has been terrorizing the land, and the Powers-That-Be see it fit to interfere and put an end to the invasion. The gameplay is a rather simple version of traditional Japanese strategy RPG. There is no exploration in the game and no movement outside of battles. The battles take place on top-down screens, and the player navigates the angelic girls in a turn-based fashion. The girls have different movement and attack ranges; for example, a knight can walk further than the wizard, but can attack only at closer range. Attacks are shown as short anime-style sequences. Experience is gained for each hit, so it's possible to level up in the middle of the battle. Sometimes armor and rings can be found, which can be later equipped on the girls. The cut-scenes between the battles are usually of sexual nature.", "platform": "Fujitsu FM Towns Marty", "release_date": "April 21, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ponytail Soft", "publishers": "Ponytail Soft", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148886-engage-errands-miwaku-no-shitotachi\n"}
