{"altername_name": [], "name": "Kid Pix", "overview": "Kid Pix is a creativity computer game created by Craig Hickman. The game includes sound effects, drawing and painting tools, rubber stamps, and wacky effects with the mixer tool. It starts out with a blank canvas when the game starts, allowing children to draw pictures on the screen freely, and can save pictures to the hard drive and print them out as well. There are many different tools included in Kid Pix which are: - Pencil: Draws freely with no constraints. - Line, Square and Circle: Draws a square, circle or straight line when the mouse button is clicked. - Wacky Brush: Like the Pencil Tool, This can apply wacky painting effects with no constraints. - Mixer: Apply effects to the picture with a click of the mouse. - Fill Bucket: Fills an outline with a click of the mouse. - Eraser: The opposite of the Pencil Tool, in which when the mouse button is held down leaves white markings on the picture. The other eraser tools can be done with just a click of the mouse. - Alphabet and Rubber Stamps: Stamps can be placed with a click of the mouse using a library of art. - Truck Mover: Move part of the picture when the mouse is held down. - Undo Guy: Undoes the last thing the player did to the picture, and clicking on it again brings it back to where it was before the Undo. - Colour Picker: Clicking on a colour swatch will select that colour for use with drawing. The player can also record a voice for the picture if a microphone is plugged into the computer.", "platform": "Fujitsu FM Towns Marty", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Br\u00f8derbund Software", "publishers": "Fujitsu Interactive", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kid_Pix", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138189-kid-pix\n"}
