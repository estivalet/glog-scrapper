{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ai Shimai: Futari no Kajitsu", "overview": "Takehito Nogawa is a young boy whose father is a wealthy businessman, owner of a powerful corporation. The boy is supposed to help his father and eventually become a true heir to him in business and management; instead, Takehito uses every opportunity to skip work and hang around the high school, where he engages in sexual escapades with two beautiful sisters. So the only real challenge for him is: which one of them does he like more?.. The game has a typical \"Look - Think - Talk\" menu during most scenes, and sexually-related commands during the numerous corresponding activities. There is also menu-based navigation, particularly around the school, to search for one of the sisters. The player must make some decisions from time to time, which might alter the course of the story, lock/unlock graphical sex scenes, and eventually lead to different endings.", "platform": "Fujitsu FM Towns Marty", "release_date": "September 30, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Silky's", "publishers": "Silky's", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.8", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/152969-ai-shimai-futari-no-kajitsu\n"}
