{"altername_name": [], "name": "Walk the Plank", "overview": "Walk the Plank is a word game based on the classic game of Hangman, but instead of stopping yourself from being hanged, you must stop Pirate Pete walking the plank. Before you start you have the choice of guessing a six or eight letter word. The actual game sees Pirate Pete from the side at the start of the plank and you have to type in a letter from the alphabet. If it is right then it appears as part of the word, but get it wrong and you move closer to the edge of the plank. You can only guess six letters wrong and if you do then you fall of the plank and into the sea. Get the word right and you move onto the next word.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX-81", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Novus Software", "genres": "Education", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/125494-walk-the-plank\n"}
