{"altername_name": ["Zan III: Ten'un Ware ni Ari: Towns Special"], "name": "Zan III: Towns Special", "overview": "The third entry in the Zan series retains the basic gameplay elements from the previous titles. Like Kager\u014d no Toki, it is set in the Sengoku period of the Japanese history - more precisely, in 16th century, the time of great turmoils and consolidation of the power, before the Tokugawa family became the sole ruler of Japan for two hundred years. As in the previous game, the player chooses a leader of a small region in Japan, with the objective to rise to power and unite the country under his rule. Diplomacy is handled similarly, but the battles became more stream-lined, without the complex elements of the previous game. New to Zan III is the possibility to create a new general. The game offers a small face editor, and the player can choose not only geographical region, but name, age, and other characteristics of the playable leader.", "platform": "Fujitsu FM Towns Marty", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Wolf Team", "publishers": "Wolf Team", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138356-zan-iii-towns-special\n"}
