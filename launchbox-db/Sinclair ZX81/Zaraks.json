{"altername_name": [], "name": "Zaraks", "overview": "Zaraks is an action game where the player has to make his way through a maze of passageways and reach his home base. On the way he will come across monsters (the Zaraks) who simply have to be shot before they spot him. There are also blockages that the player has to blast through. The player has a limited quota of energy that decreases as time goes. To recharge energy the player needs to pick up power cells that can be found around the maze. When completing a level a high score is given based on how long time it has taken. If the player is shot or energy runs out he has to start the maze over.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX-81", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "CRL Group", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSKEwbwIIAU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/125493-zaraks\n"}
