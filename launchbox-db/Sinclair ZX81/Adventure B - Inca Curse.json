{"altername_name": ["Inca Curse"], "name": "Adventure B: Inca Curse", "overview": "Second game in Artic's Adventure Series, your aim is to enter the yet-undisturbed Inca temple and go treasure hunting. Inside the temple is lots of such treasure (each worth a certain point value), but also traps to catch the greedy. You will encounter a Sacrificial Chamber, a Fire Room and a Pool. Gather as much treasure as possible and return to the jungle clearing to finish the adventure. The game features a simple 'Verb Noun' command interface, and no graphics of any description. Instructions such as 'break door with rock' have to be split into two commands.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX-81", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Arctic Computing", "publishers": "Artic Computing", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/102746-adventure-b-inca-curse\n"}
