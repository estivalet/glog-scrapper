{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ring Out!!", "overview": "When an old man couldn't pay his debts to a sinister criminal organization, his eighteen-year-old daughter Aya was taken away by them and forced to participate in wrestling performances where young women must assault each other sexually in order to win. The gameplay of Ring Out!! is similar to that of a visual novel, without verb-object interaction or any kind of movement. There are usually multiple choices per scene, but most of the times the player simply needs to go through them repeatedly to trigger the next event. The game consists almost entirely of explicit sex scenes.", "platform": "Fujitsu FM Towns Marty", "release_date": "June 9, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "ZyX", "publishers": "ZyX", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138306-ring-out\n"}
