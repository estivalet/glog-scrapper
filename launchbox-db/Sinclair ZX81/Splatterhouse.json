Rick must survive seven blood-soaked levels full of corpses, demons, and other disturbing creatures in this arcade side-scrolling beat-em-up. Several weapons are at Rick's disposal throughout the house, such as a meat cleaver, a two by four, and a shotgun. If Rick wants to find Jennifer alive, he must move quickly through the floors of the mansion.... as a happy reunion is not always guaranteed.", "platform": "Fujitsu FM Towns Marty", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ving", "publishers": "Namco", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.88", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splatterhouse", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/74910-splatterhouse\n"}
