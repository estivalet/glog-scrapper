{"altername_name": [], "name": "Viper V10 Turbo RS", "overview": "The third Viper has the same structure as the two previous entries: three unrelated stories with little interaction, but many animated sex scenes. The stories this time are: Northern Lights describes a competition between two young apprentices of kendo. The protagonist, a young boy, is challenging the girl Asuka, who claims to be better than him. He needs to practice in order to win, especially because Asuka promised him she will do whatever he wants if he defeats her... Children's Play tells the story of a teenage girl named Yuki, who is in love with an older school mate. One morning she goes to school, only to discover that someone has made pictures of her masturbating to the boy's photo... Read Under follows the adventures of a team of three female soldiers who have to infiltrate the base of an evil robot simply known as \"Boss\". One of them is captured, and the other two have to save her at all costs. Of the three stories, only \"Northern Lights\" has interaction. The two others are composed of text, pictures, and animated scenes, without any input from the player but pressing the Enter button to see the next scene. \"Northern Lights\" has a few branching points, during which the player has to choose a course of action for the hero. Some of these choices lead to Game Over.", "platform": "Fujitsu FM Towns Marty", "release_date": "July 28, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Sogna", "publishers": "Sogna", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138345-viper-v10-turbo-rs\n"}
