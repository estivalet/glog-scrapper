{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dr. STOP!", "overview": "In Dr. Stop! you control Takumi, who works in a hospital and whose mind is mostly occupied with female patients, most of whom are young and pretty. One day, during a visit to a patient, an explosion occurs. Who caused it - one of the patients or an outsider, or maybe a staff member? It's up to you to investigate, and win the affection of your lovely patients. Dr. Stop! is a traditional first-person anime-style Japanese adventure. You interact with the game by selecting commands from a menu. In some of the rooms you'll see backgrounds, while others have text-only descriptions. You move around the hospital by selecting destinations from a menu while looking at the hospital map.", "platform": "Fujitsu FM Towns Marty", "release_date": "June 15, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Alice Soft", "publishers": "Alice Soft", "genres": "Visual Novel", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/155229-dr-stop\n"}
