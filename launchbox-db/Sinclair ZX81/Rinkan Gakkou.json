{"altername_name": [], "name": "Rinkan Gakkou", "overview": "Tomoki Tsugawa is a somewhat effeminate-looking male college student aspiring to become a teacher. One day he meets a former schoolmate who is working as a teacher in a girls high school. He agrees to let Tomoki participate in the school's summer camp, under the condition that he wears woman's clothes and passes as a girl. Rinkan Gakkou plays like a visual novel, having no permanent menu and (with a few exceptions) no other way to interact with the environment but by selecting choices or locations to visit. The choices usually affect the storyline only in a minor way, and there is no possibility to die in the game. The PC-9821 CD Edition includes versions for Win 95 and FM TOWNS.", "platform": "Fujitsu FM Towns Marty", "release_date": "February 2, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Foster", "publishers": "Foster", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138304-rinkan-gakkou\n"}
