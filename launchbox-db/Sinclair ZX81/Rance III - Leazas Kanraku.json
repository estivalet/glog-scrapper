{"altername_name": [], "name": "Rance III: Leazas Kanraku", "overview": "The money our hero Rance got in Custom City as payment for his latest detective work has been long gone. The brave private investigator with an eye on pretty women is now jobless again. At least his lovely purple-haired girlfriend and assistant Sill is still with him. Meeting a girl from the Kingdom of Leazas makes Rance hope for a better future. His boss Keith offers him what seems like a routine job: venture into a nearby cave and save a girl from monsters. An adventure full of danger and encounters with beautiful women begins! Rance III: Leazas Kanraku continues the erotic tradition of the series and is heavier on sexual content than its two predecessors. Town navigation is done through first-person perspective viewing of still backgrounds and interacting via commands (\"look\", \"talk\", \"move\", etc.). In towns, the player may talk to people, rest, and buy equipment or items. Once in a dungeon, the perspective switches to top-down view. Monster encounters are random. Battles are turn-based and are played on a separate top-down battle screen. The player can freely move characters over the battle screen and attack or cast spells when enemies are in range.", "platform": "Fujitsu FM Towns Marty", "release_date": "May 13, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Alice Soft", "publishers": "Alice Soft", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rance_(series)#Rance_III_%E2%80%93_Fall_of_Leazas_%E2%80%93", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138298-rance-iii-leazas-kanraku\n"}
