{"altername_name": ["Kyan Kyan Collection: Daifugouhen"], "name": "Kyan Kyan Collection", "overview": "Kyan Kyan Collection is similar in concept to an earlier game with the same name, being a strip Daifug\u014d card game. However, the opponents are different, and rather than selecting them from the main menu the player faces them one after the other in a linear fashion. The graphics are also completely different, and the girls' undressing scenes are animated. This release also has a much lower difficulty level.", "platform": "Fujitsu FM Towns Marty", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "I-cell", "publishers": "I-cell", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "0.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138195-kyan-kyan-collection\n"}
