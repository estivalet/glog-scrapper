On the way a variety of puzzles, sub-quests and really nasty monsters dog your every step.", "platform": "Fujitsu FM Towns Marty", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Reflections Interactive", "publishers": "Victor Entertainment", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.12", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_of_the_Beast_II", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/SWTCA-Io1xk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/134109-shadow-of-the-beast-ii-juushin-no-jubaku\n"}
