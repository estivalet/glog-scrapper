{"altername_name": [], "name": "Psychic Detective Series Vol. 2: Memories", "overview": "The psychic detective Katsuya Furuyagi cannot forget his past. Looking at the photo in his office, he recalls Rieka, the woman who won't leave him in his dreams. At that moment, a young girl enters the office; seemingly distressed, she utters a strange request: \"erase the memory of my father\". Intrigued, Furuyagi uses his psychic abilities to travel to the past and relive memories and people's fates once again. Memories is the second installment in the Psychic Detective series. The gameplay is largely identical to that of the previous entry. Locations are viewed from first-person perspective, and interaction with the environment (including movement to another location) is performed through a command menu. Conversations with characters serve as the primary tool to advance the game's plot.", "platform": "Fujitsu FM Towns Marty", "release_date": "October 20, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Data West", "publishers": "Data West", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138286-psychic-detective-series-vol-2-memories\n"}
