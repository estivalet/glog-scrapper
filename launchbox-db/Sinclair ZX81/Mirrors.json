{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mirrors", "overview": "Mirrors is a Japanese-style adventure game. It was originally released on CD for the NEC PC-88 in 1990 and was ported (and graphically revamped) in 1992 for the Fujitsu FM-Towns. The plot puts the player in the role of a musician, the lead singer for the band \"Elleno Vision\", haunted by terrible nightmares and stalked by a mysterious murderer during the band's world tour. The game is played in first person and is similar to a novel, allowing the player to choose from different actions from a menu. Like many Japanese adventure games of the time, Mirrors features a branching storyline and different endings based on the player's decisions.", "platform": "Fujitsu FM Towns Marty", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Soft Studio Wing", "publishers": "Apros", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138261-mirrors\n"}
