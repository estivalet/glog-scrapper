{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cosmic Guerilla", "overview": "Cosmic Guerilla is an unofficial conversion of Universal's arcade game with the same name. The basic gameplay is mostly the same although the scenario differs a bit. Here, the cosmic guerillas are raiding a city in space which the player has to defend. At his disposal he has his Svlegian Raider which is moved across the bottom of the screen while shooting at the enemies above. The enemies begin at the sides of the screen and move towards the centre where supply pods are located. The pods are protected by barriers that the aliens will remove one piece at a time. Once they have made a whole through they can take the pods and transport them back to the edge of the screen. The player has to prevent them from doing this by shooting them down in time. At the same time he has to watch out for their fire. Some protection is offered by four Space Invaders-esque shields. The player has three lives and loses one when shot or when the aliens recover a pod. Before a game, one of three game speeds can be chosen.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX-81", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "C.K.
