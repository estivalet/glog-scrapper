It is a straightforward fighting game with no power-ups or strategy elements. The player controls a female robot named Mimi and has to beat six opponents, who are supposed to be robots and beautiful young women at the same time, in three rounds each. After each successful round, a picture of the opponent in increasing state of undress is displayed. If the player loses the battle, it is instead the protagonist who gets undressed.", "platform": "Fujitsu FM Towns Marty", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Forest", "publishers": "Forest", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/134143-ningyou-tsukai\n"}
