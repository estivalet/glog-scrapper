{"altername_name": [], "name": "MegaMorph", "overview": "In the future, remains of a mysterious, highly advanced ancient civilization were discovered in a cave on a deserted planet. A unique material was found there, which could spontaneously change shape and morph into complete products by itself. Humans were able to harvest the technology, but an accident destroyed the source. The player takes the role of a pilot who must venture to dangerous areas of space in order to discover possible additional sources of the material. MegaMorph is a third-person perspective arcade-style shooter, similar in concept and gameplay to Microcosm and Novastorm. The backgrounds consists entirely out of full-motion video sequences. Forward movement is on rails, but the player can move the craft in four directions. The craft can defend itself with regular fire with unlimited ammunition, or drop a limited supply of missiles. Stages typically culminate with boss battles.", "platform": "Fujitsu FM Towns Marty", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Psygnosis", "publishers": "Fujitsu Interactive", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/vD33w0J7zH4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/134376-megamorph\n"}
