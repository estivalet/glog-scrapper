{"altername_name": [], "name": "Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis", "overview": "Indiana Jones is back! The great archaeologist and adventurer has to solve a grand mystery once again, aided by his trusty whip, his sharp wit, and his courage. A man who calls himself Mr. Smith is interested in a certain ancient statue. When the unsuspecting Indy hands it over to the client, he finds out that Mr. Smith is in fact a colonel in the Nazi army! Why was he so interested in that statue? A young woman who had once worked together with Indy, the pretty red-haired (and a bit troublesome) Sophia, tells him the whole thing must have a connection with the legendary lost continent Atlantis. Gathering clues from all over the world, Indy and Sophia embark on a grand journey across the globe. Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis is a puzzle-solving adventure game conceived in the spirit of Indiana Jones movies; however, it is not based on a specific movie, introducing a new, independent story. The game utilizes LucasArts' SCUMM system, with action verbs the player chooses from a menu; objects that can be interacted with are highlighted. The game contains many puzzles of various kinds (mostly inventory-based) and dialogues with multiple choices. There are also a few simple hand-to-hand fights against the Nazis, some of which can be avoided.", "platform": "Fujitsu FM Towns Marty", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "LucasArts Entertainment", "publishers": "Victor Entertainment", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Fate_of_Atlantis", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/JoMKv_B0zvo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/88549-indiana-jones-and-the-fate-of-atlantis\n"}
