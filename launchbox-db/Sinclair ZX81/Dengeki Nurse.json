{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dengeki Nurse", "overview": "The main hero of the game is a young doctor named Tanchi. One day, his boss, the old professor Akihabara, invites him to his office and reveals some secrets concerning the young man's parents and an international crime syndicate known as Black Cross, which Akihabara was trying to bring down. Meanwhile, Black Cross sends a female agent under codename 0074 to assassinate a certain powerful man who happens to stay in the same hospital where Tanchi works... Dengeki Nurse consists of two main gameplay modes: Japanese-style adventure and turn-based one-on-one battles. The adventure gameplay stars Tanchi as protagonist, and requires the player to click on verb commands (Look, Talk, Think, Action, and Move) to advance the story. The turn-based battles have agent 0074 (Kirara) as the playable character, and occur as events dictated by the story; there is also a \"Free Battle\" mode (accessible from the main menu), which allows the player to fight against an opponent of his/her choice. Kirara can perform regular attacks (punches and kicks) for low damage, spend turns to charge power and unleash a devastating attack afterwards, or use various drugs for healing and supporting purposes.", "platform": "Fujitsu FM Towns Marty", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Cocktail Soft", "publishers": "Cocktail Soft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/134136-dengeki-nurse\n"}
