{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mahjong de Pon!", "overview": "Mahjong de Pon! is a strip mahjong game of the one-on-one variety. The player assumes the role of a male mahjong specialist who competes in an elite club against three young women. It is necessary to defeat them one by one, in a linear fashion. As soon as the opponent runs out of money (which happens immediately if the player manages to get the highest mahjong combination in a round) she removes an item of her clothing. The game has three difficulty levels and also includes a training mode that explains mahjong rules in detail and allows the player to practice with the guidance of a teacher.", "platform": "Fujitsu FM Towns Marty", "release_date": "February 18, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Active Software", "publishers": "Active Software", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138218-mahjong-de-pon\n"}
