{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mazogs", "overview": "Your quest is to enter a maze to explore it and find the treasure before returning back to your start position. The maze is viewed from above with part of the maze shown on the screen. As you explore you will encounter Mazogs and to defeat them you need to find a sword, you can fight without one but your chances of winning are reduced. A sword can only be used once to fight but there are many swords scattered around the maze. You will also encounter prisoners bricked up in the walls and they will give you a route to the treasure, but the route only appears for ten seconds so you will need to move as quick as you can. A map showing part of the maze can be brought up at any time showing you any Mazogs, prisoners, swords and the treasure if near. Before the start of the game you have three difficulty levels, Try it Out, Face a Challenge and Maniac Mobile Mazogs.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX-81", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Don Priestley", "publishers": "Softsync", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaE-Gje_O7c", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/102743-mazogs\n"}
