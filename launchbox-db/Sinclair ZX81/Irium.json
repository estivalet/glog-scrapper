{"altername_name": [], "name": "Irium", "overview": "The world Irium is a world ruled by magic. One of the most powerful magicians of Irium, the young and lovely Seria, decided to pay a visit to the magic-less world which is our Earth. There, she met a young man; they fell in love, and had a child together. But Seria eventually had to return to Irium. The child, who was named Masaya, grew up on the Earth and turned to be a normal teenager, unaware of the magical powers sealed within him - until a messenger from Irium appears on the Earth and tells him that their world is in great trouble, and he is the only one who can save it... Despite heavy amounts of text, dialogues, and an adventure-like interface (with a menu of verb commands) for all the locations except the dungeons, Irium is still a RPG in its core, more specifically a first-person dungeon crawler. The player controls a party consisting of Masaya and up to three female companions. The dungeons are identically-looking pseudo-3D mazes (with an auto-map), which have to be explored and safely traversed to reach the destination dictated by the story. Enemies appear randomly, and the combat is turn-based. Some of the characters learn offensive and supportive magic, used in combat or outside of it. There are sex scenes in the game, all of them rather \"softcore\" (comparable to those seen in Knight of Xentar or other Elf games). The player has no control over their outcome, but has to select menu commands to advance.", "platform": "Fujitsu FM Towns Marty", "release_date": "July 9, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Orange House", "publishers": "Orange House", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138181-irium\n"}
