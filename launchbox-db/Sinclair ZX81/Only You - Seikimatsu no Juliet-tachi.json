{"altername_name": [], "name": "Only You: Seikimatsu no Juliet-tachi", "overview": "A Japanese teenager named Hiroki is interested in martial arts, and has to take care of his little sister. Their older brother Yoichi had gone abroad; just when he announced that he was coming back he disappeared under mysterious circumstances. Hiroki and his friends eventually find out that an international supernatural criminal syndicate is in cohorts with an even darker power that is about to bring the apocalypse onto Earth. Only You can be considered a hybrid of RPG and visual novel-like adventure with choices that affect the storyline and the hero's relationship with various female characters. Locations are represented as still anime-style images, and all the interaction is done with menu commands. Much of the gameplay is dedicated to selecting locations from a city map and triggering extended cutscenes. The RPG elements are present in scripted and random one-on-one turn-based battles, during which Hiroki and his opponent exchange various types of physical and special attacks until one of them is defeated. The protagonist gains experience points from battles and levels up. There are no equipment or usable items in the game. Traveling to locations and resting deplete a special counter; when it reaches zero, the apocalypse is triggered and the game is over. It is necessary to battle the antagonists and advance the plot in order to reset the counter.", "platform": "Fujitsu FM Towns Marty", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Alice Soft", "publishers": "Alice Soft", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/142862-only-you-seikimatsu-no-juliet-tachi\n"}
