It's a side-scrolling shooter where the player controls a spacecraft flying over the surface of an alien planet. Movement is limited to moving up and down and there are two weapons to attack with: forward going missiles and bombs that are dropped onto ground targets. Five missiles can be fired at a time and three bombs can be dropped at a time. Targets include aliens that swoop down from above and rockets that launch from the ground. On the ground there are also fuel dumps. The game goes on until the player has lost all three lives or the fuel runs out.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX-81", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dave Edwards", "publishers": "Quicksilva", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/102779-qs-scramble\n"}
