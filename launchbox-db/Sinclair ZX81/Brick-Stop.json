{"altername_name": ["Brick Stop"], "name": "Brick-Stop", "overview": "Brick-Stop has you controlling a bat close to the middle of the screen, moving it left or right. Blocks fall from the top of the screen and you must stop them falling with the bat to make a barrier of bricks. If you complete the barrier then the game will restart. Any blocks that pass the bat pile up on the bottom of the screen and if they reach the same level as the bat then it is game over. There are nine skill levels to choose from (1-9) and this dictates the amount of blocks that fall.", "platform": "Sinclair ZX-81", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "CDS Micro Systems", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivjl25HhCxw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/102874-brick-stop\n"}
