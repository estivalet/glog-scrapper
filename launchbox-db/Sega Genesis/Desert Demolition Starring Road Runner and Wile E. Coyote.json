{"altername_name": [], "name": "Desert Demolition Starring Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote", "overview": "Play either the Road Runner OR Wile E. Coyote in this unique side-scroller that is just like an interactive Saturday morning cartoon. Your goal: run through six different desert environments before time expires, collecting ACME stamps. As the Road Runner, speed is your ally as you do incredible jumps, burn though loop-de-loops, and avoid all of the Coyote's contraptions and ambushes. The Road Runner can also scare an unsuspecting Coyote with his Beep-Beep attack. As the Coyote, you use Acme's crazy gadgets to catch the Road Runner, constantly attempting to master their power without getting yourself flattened. The Coyote has a special leap attack which allows him to make a last ditch attempt to grab the bird!", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "February 1, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "BlueSky Software", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.79", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert_Demolition", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTf3VPDUmXI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4104\n"}
