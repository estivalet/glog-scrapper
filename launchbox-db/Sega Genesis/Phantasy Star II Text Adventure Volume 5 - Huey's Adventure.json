Hugh Thompson (Hy\u016bi Lean or Huey Reane) is a scholar in biology at Motavia University. He's called in by the University president to investigate an incident involving an energy-sapping plant creature roaming the campus, feeding itself on electricity and steadily growing larger in the process. After the creature spreads itself through the college's reactor over to the main energy center, threatening to deprive the entire town of Kvarts of its electricity, Hugh sets out to try and stop it. This adventure is what eventually drives Hugh to adapt his knowledge of anatomy to combat biomonsters, in the aid of Rolf in Phantasy Star II.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/33540\n"}
