{"altername_name": [], "name": "Paperboy", "overview": "PAPERBOY. The arcade hit that really delivers! Ride your trusty bike - loaded with tightly rolled newspapers - through a comical, ever-changing neighborhood. Score big points by tossing papers into subscribers' mailboxes and porches. Don't miss, 'cause you'll lose a customer for every bad throw. Now, for the real fun: score even bigger points by bombarding nonsubscribers' homes, taking out their windows, lamps and statues! But watch out for bad drivers, skate-boarders, remote control cars and lots of other obstacles. They can ruin your day real fast. After work, take on the Training Course, a BMX-style bonus round that'll test your aim and riding skills to the max!", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "February 1, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Motivetime Ltd.", "publishers": "Tengen", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.8", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paperboy_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w5akdUmR-E", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4309\n"}
