{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sonic Winter Adventures", "overview": "Here is what is involved in this hack: \u2022 Blast Processing. Who says Sega can\u2019t do what Super Nintendo does? \u2022 Russian and English languages. Sonic Winter Adventures also has two language settings, English and Russian. The two languages are represented in one menu. You can change the language in the Options menu. \u2022 High-speed gameplay! Like the best features of its predecessor, Sonic Quick Winter Adventures, SWA brings new tricks to the table that add even more speed and drive to the game play. Some of the moves include the Homing Attack, Jump Dash, Super Peel Out, and of course, the good old Spin Dash. \u2022 New bosses. Making bosses is usually a very complex process that requires a lot of effort. Not to mention, it can be difficult sometimes to come up with the idea of a good boss, but as you can see from my past projects, a special fondness for bosses has been shown! Therefore, one of the key elements of Sonic Winter Adventures is the bosses. In this hack, particular attention was paid to the development of bosses, which means lots of time and effort had been poured in. \u2022 Unlockables. Even after you finished all the levels, the game is far from over! As you go, you will open some previously hidden features and modes, so be on the lookout.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "April 28, 2013", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "vladikcomper", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MB6VEAe8kY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/126423\n"}
