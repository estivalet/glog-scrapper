Use it to squelch pop-eyed super-slugs \u2014 and lots of other ghouls, goblins and creepy creations. You're Chuck D. Head. And you're beheaded for a bone-chilling adventure. Boing off a pole. Leap across collapsing log bridges. Bop atop a roving eyeball. Then punch a skull head for extra propulsion. Or start a psychedelic earthquake in Dr. Frank N. Stein's lab. Ghastly creatures prowl Eyeland's body parts. Totem poles bury you alive. Horned beasts lash their tongues. Finally, meet Max D.Cap. And remember: if he spooks you...it's all in your head.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "October 1, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Vic Tokai", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.97", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decap_Attack", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_Wuao9IbBk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4102\n"}
