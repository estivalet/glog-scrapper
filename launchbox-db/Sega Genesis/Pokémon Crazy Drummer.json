{"altername_name": ["Pok\u00e9mon Crazy Drummer"], "name": "Pok\u00e9mon Crazy Drummer", "overview": "Pok\u00e9mon Crazy Drummer is a music simulation game developed by Tomsoft. Apart from \"Pok\u00e9mon\" being in the title and a mugshot of Pikachu's head used in-game, this is a mostly original game. Pok\u00e9mon Crazy Drummer is a rhythm game, similar in ways to DrumMania. There are two main modes: Arcade and Practice, as well as a controller testing mode and an option mode. There are six songs (Dangerous, Think You, Relight, Bicycle, Reflect, and Clap), three difficulty settings (Easy, Normal, and Crazy), and eight settings for the drum pad's timbre (Classic, Cha Ka, Cyber, Pop 1, Pop 2, Soul, Big Band, and 2010 Music). In-game, notes scroll up on the right, and the player must hit the button that corresponds with the note shown when it matches with the symbol for the note. A player is given points for every note matched (100 for Perfect, 30 for Great, 10 for Poor, and 0 for Miss). At the end, a results screen comes up, showing how many of each note you got in each category, multiplied by their value and added up, except for Miss, which is multiplied by 10, and is subtracted from the total, and shows if you have passed or failed.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "2003", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tomsoft", "publishers": "Tomsoft", "genres": "Music", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6693X6W3TSo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/122158\n"}
