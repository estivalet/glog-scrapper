{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pocket Monsters", "overview": "Pocket Monster is an unlicensed platformer based off the Pok\u00e9mon series for the Mega Drive and SNES. The SNES version is credited to DVS Electronic Co., while the Mega Drive iteration seems to be developed by ex-workers from Chuanpu and published by X Boy. Like the Famicom pirate, the player controls Pikachu through numerous side-scrolling levels. There are 5 levels in total, with a boss at the end of each, as well as a mini-boss in the first level of the Mega Drive version. Pikachu can jump on enemies and uses a special move which clears all of the enemies on the screen, although the latter can only be done when the charge meter is full (indicated by a power bar at the top of the screen of the SNES version, or a numeric counter in the Mega Drive version, which is full when it hits 20.) The player can start either with 3 and 5 lives and continues each, and there's a difficulty setting in the options menu. A sequel to this game was made for the Mega Drive, Pocket Monster II. The ending is an image of some Pikachus.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "December 1, 2000", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Chuanpu Technology", "publishers": "X-Boy", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.15", "wikipedia": "http://bootleggames.wikia.com/wiki/Pocket_Monster_(Mega_Drive/SNES)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/91475\n"}
