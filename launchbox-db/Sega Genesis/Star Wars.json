{"altername_name": ["Super Star Wars"], "name": "Star Wars", "overview": "Originally developed for the SNES by LucasArts in 1992, Super Star Wars was the very first Star Wars title to grace the SNES platform. It was a faithful retelling of \"A New Hope\". The game was released in late 1992, but plans for ports of the game had begun. Both a Sega CD and a PC port were teased sometime in 1993-1994, but both would eventually be canceled by LucasArts themselves. In Europe, a Sega Mega Drive port of Super Star Wars was teased and even shown in various magazines throughout 1993. The port was being done by Sega Interactive, formally known as Interactive Designs. A more ambitious version the Sega CD was also planned which would've included CD quality audio and FMV sequences. Aside from a few scarce screenshots of the first level and oddly some shots from a developer's workstation, this is all the information that would be gathered on the project. The game was soon canceled for unknown reasons along with the rest of the planned ports of the game.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega Interactive", "publishers": "Never Published (Prototype)", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/124521\n"}
