{"altername_name": ["Awogue"], "name": "Aworg: Hero in the Sky", "overview": "Aworg is a scrolling action game where the player controls the titular hero as he flies and floats around each stage. He must collect three flashing \"gate keys\" in order to open the warp gate on each stage, while fending off enemies and avoiding various hazards. Aworg can move freely using his fans, which will propel him in various directions and fire a burst of air in the opposing direction; this burst of air is his basic attack, and can push enemies around. He can also do a rushing attack, as well as a special move called the \"Rolling Aworg\" which will deal a lot of damage to nearby enemies, but will also deplete Aworg's power.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.88", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/33320\n"}
