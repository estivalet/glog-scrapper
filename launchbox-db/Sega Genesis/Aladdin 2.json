{"altername_name": ["Aladdin II"], "name": "Aladdin 2", "overview": "Aladdin II is an unlicensed Mega Drive port of the SNES version of Disney's Aladdin, originally made by Capcom in 1994. It might have been developed by ex-workers from Chuanpu Technology and was likely published by X Boy. This port can be considered the \"opposite\" of Aladdin 2000, a port of Virgin's Aladdin to the SNES. The game features all the stages from the original game, although with different color palettes. It only has some predefined enemies and they have the same color palette in every stage. Unlike the legit SNES version, the Mega Drive port lacks the bonus mini-games that appear once you complete each stage. The game still shows a Continue screen once the player loses all their lives, but lacks Aladdin's monkey Abu (who doesn't appear outside of cutscenes). The sound effects are from the original game, but slowed down and compressed, and the music seems to be remade from the original game.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.45", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4014\n"}
