The game was likely developed by BMB, considering the similarities to their other games. You get to pick one of the four turtles (Leonardo, Michelangelo, Donatello and Raphael), who all function the exact same. The enemies have very basic AI, and there can only be two of them on the screen. The music is randomly selected whenever you start out the game or lose, although sometimes Stage 6 doesn't have any music at all.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "BMB", "publishers": "KDS", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106912\n"}
