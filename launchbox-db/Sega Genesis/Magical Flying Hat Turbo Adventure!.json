The peaceful island, Usontou, has been split into seven pieces, and it's up to our hero, Hat, and his friends to restore the island and defeat the evil king! Based on the 1989 TV anime Magical Hat, produced by Studio Pierrot and based on the original manga by Youji Katakura, this is an action platform game not unlike the Master System classic Psycho Fox. You play as the titular Hat, jumping on and punching enemies, grabbing items from statues, and fighting a boss at the end of each world. In each stage, you can find your robot-egg friend Robegg hidden somewhere, who will help you out by acting as a projectile and a shield. There are a wide range of different power-up items that can be obtained in the game, which will do things like give you temporary invincibility, freeze all the enemies for a short time, give you an extra-high jump, or even call in air support from a helicopter. At the end of each stage, you can play a game of chance to win extra items and lives. A heavily modified version of the game was released outside of Japan as DEcapAttack. The graphics, sound, story, and many of the stages were changed.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "December 15, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Vic Tokai", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/33625\n"}
