{"altername_name": [], "name": "Double Dragon II: The Revenge", "overview": "At the end of the 20th century, violence ruled the city after the nuclear war. The people of the city were living in fear of the Black Warriors, a criminal organization that has acquired tremendous influence. On the outskirts of the city also lived twin brothers named Jimmy and Billy Lee, who were running their own kung-fu gym. One day, the Black Warriors were gathered on a certain spot after their usual rampaging of the city when a young woman accidentally stumbled into their meeting. The gang brutally murdered her without mercy. Her name was Marian, Billy Lee's girlfriend. With his older brother Jimmy, Billy sets out on a mission to get his revenge on the Black Warriors. Double Dragon II: The Revenge is a 1989 side-scrolling beat-'em-up released for the arcades by Technos. A Sega Mega Drive version was produced by PALSOFT in 1991. Unlike the earlier NES version that was developed in-house by Technos, which was a different game with a similar plot, this was intended to be a more direct conversion of the arcade game. While this version ended up being exclusive to Japan, other Double Dragon games (including a port of the first game) were later released for the Sega Genesis by other publishers in North America and Europe (which were conversely unreleased in Japan).", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "December 20, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "PALSOFT", "publishers": "Palsoft", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.61", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sdwtcax4gnY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27744\n"}
