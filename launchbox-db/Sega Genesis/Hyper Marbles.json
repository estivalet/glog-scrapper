{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hyper Marbles", "overview": "In the future, even the simple kids game of marbles is high-tech and extreme. Hyper Marbles takes the basic concept of the classic kids game -- to knock the opponent's marbles out of the playfield -- and gives it a futuristic sci-fi twist. The player directs their robotic marble around the field, attempting to push their opponents into the deadly electrified walls lining the arena. Aiding in this is a jet booster, which can cause opponents to bounce quite far, but if overused will overheat and must cool down before being used again. There are ten different arenas, each with different hazards like oil slicks and moving barriers. There is a single player mode, where the goal is to destroy all enemies to move on, as well as a two-player versus mode where the goal is to destroy the other player.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "March 27, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.8", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/33614\n"}
