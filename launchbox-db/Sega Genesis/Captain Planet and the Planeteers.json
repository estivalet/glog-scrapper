{"altername_name": [], "name": "Captain Planet and the Planeteers", "overview": "Children growing up in the early 90s were worried about impending environmental doom. The popular Captain Planet cartoons told them they were doomed, unless a superhero could be formed by a multinational group of youths (the Planeteers of the title), to take on the polluters and deforesters. Each of the five levels of this platform game has a specific mission and boss, and is undertaken by a specific Planeteer. These involve destroying hazards, shooting enemies, moving across suspended poles, and jumping onto ledges. You have four energy and four power units - more can be collected up to a limit of 8, and they will always be recharged to four (if necessary) when you reach a boss. You have an unlimited standard shot and a more powerful Super shot, which drains power.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "February 16, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "NovaLogic, Inc.", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.48", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/19682\n"}
