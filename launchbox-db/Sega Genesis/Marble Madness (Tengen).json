{"altername_name": ["Marble Madness (Japan)"], "name": "Marble Madness (Tengen)", "overview": "The idea is deceptively simple: Guide a marble down a path without hitting any obstacles or straying off the course. The game is viewed from an isometric perspective, which makes it harder to stay focused on the direction the ball is to follow. There are tight corridors to follow and enemies to avoid. There is a 2-player mode in which players must race to the finish; otherwise you're racing against the clock. Atari Games' home console division Tengen produced their own Mega Drive copy for the Japanese market in 1993, which is different to the Electronic Arts version. This Japanese version, which appears to have been produced internally by Tengen of Japan, is much more faithful to the original game and supports the Sega Mouse.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "August 13, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tengen", "publishers": "Tengen", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZxTvz4WESM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/157256\n"}
