{"altername_name": ["World Class Leader Board", "World Class Leaderboard Golf"], "name": "World Class Leaderboard Golf", "overview": "Before the long-running Links series, Access Software produced the Leader Board lineage, which concludes here. Wind, snap and power are the main considerations as players dodge the bunkers, water and rough, which make for more complex courses than the 8-bit versions of the original. A course editor is included. The courses provided include real locations: St. Andrews (Scotland), Cypress Creek and Doral Country Club (USA) and a fictional one, The Gauntlet, which, as the name suggests, is designed to push the player's skills to the maximum. The PC version utilizes the PC speaker to reproduce voice samples via the company's patented RealSound process. Quips like \"No doubt about it, he's deep in the sandtrap\", \"Straight onto the fairway\", and \"Looks like he hit the tree, Jim\" are used to provide running commentary on the gameplay.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "August 1, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Access Software, Inc.", "publishers": "U.S. Gold Ltd.", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.19", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4484\n"}
