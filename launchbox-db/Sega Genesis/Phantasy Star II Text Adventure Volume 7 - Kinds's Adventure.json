{"altername_name": ["Phantasy Star II: Kinds's Adventure", "Phantasy Star II Text Adventure Volume 7: Kinds's Adventure"], "name": "Phantasy Star II Text Adventure Volume 7: Kinds's Adventure", "overview": "The game takes place in autumn of AW 1281, about three years before the onset of Phantasy Star II. Josh Kain (or Kain Ji An, Kainzu) is an 18 year old aspiring engineer who always loved machines, and had become quite knowledgeable in how electrical devices and robots function. He built many small devices, fixed appliances, and even learned to hack computers. However, due to being scatterbrained and clumsy, he would sometimes destroy the things he tried to fix. Eventually, after one particularly disastrous repair job, he gave up trying to be an engineer, deciding instead to put his \"talent\" for destroying things to good use. Thus did he become a \"wrecker\", his job being to trash anything electronic. He starts off joining a gang of rebels out to destroy Mother Brain, before he eventually ends up teaming up with Rolf in Phantasy Star II towards that very end.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/33541\n"}
