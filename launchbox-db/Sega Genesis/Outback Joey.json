{"altername_name": [], "name": "Outback Joey", "overview": "Joey, a kangaroo, lives with his family in northern Australia. Their peaceful life is interrupted by the invasion of a group of poachers who take away several of his family members, so Joey sets out on a journey to bring them back. Outback Joey is the only game released for the HeartBeat Personal Trainer, a Sega Genesis-based fitness system. Using a pulse sensor and game control pads mounted to an exercise bike, stairclimer, treadmill or ski machine, players have to exercise while playing an otherwise traditional 2D platformer. The player's heartbeat is directly tied to the player character's in-game speed, with a healthy heartbeat allowing him to move faster and a resting heartbeat slowing him down to a slog. Players can create a profile with their name, age, and gender, and their health data is tracked persistently over time to let them track their progress. Outback Joey is an extremely rare Sega Mega Drive game. It was bundled with the Heartbeat Personal Trainer exclusively in North America and was not sold separately. As the Heartbeat Personal Trainer only had a production run of 1000 units, it is assumed only 1000 copies of Outback Joey exist too.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Western Technologies", "publishers": "Heartbeat", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/153119\n"}
