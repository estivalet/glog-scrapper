They've kidnapped a former President, and the MERCS are going in for the rescue. Punch through their coastal defenses, snatch enemy weapons and gain firepower. Pick up machine guns, bazookas and heavy artillery as you advance through the smoke of burning metal. Power up a flamethrower, and good-bye, Charlie! Push through a non-stop barrage of lead, grenades, heat-seeking missiles and attack choppers. Hijack tanks and gunboats. Shred 'em with your own weapons. They messed with your country - now you're gonna make 'em scream!", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "September 27, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.98", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercs", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtgvcIqzwtI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4265\n"}
