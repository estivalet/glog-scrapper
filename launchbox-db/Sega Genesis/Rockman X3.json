{"altername_name": ["Rockman X3", "Mega Man X3"], "name": "Rockman X3", "overview": "Rockman X3 is a pirated port of the game of the same name, made for the Mega Drive by Sankyo Fundship. There are two versions of this of this on the internet with slight differences between them, mostly due to stage music. This game is a port of the Saturn version. Despite being a straight port, this game has many things missing from other versions, including the removal of Ride Armors, Toxic Seahorse and Blast Hornet, as well as some stages leading to the wrong place, like Doppler Fortress leading to a modified version of Volt Catfish's stage instead. As well as this, all of the cutscenes from the original are missing and the rooms they take place in are empty.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sankyo Fundship", "publishers": "Sankyo Fundship", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.09", "wikipedia": "http://segaretro.org/Rockman_X3_(Mega_Drive)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YAZrFw2E8s", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4365\n"}
