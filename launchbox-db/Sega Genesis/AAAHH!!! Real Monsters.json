{"altername_name": [], "name": "AAAHH!!! Real Monsters", "overview": "In this game, based on popular Nickelodeon comics, you control three monsters: Ickis, Oblina, and Krumm. The Gromble, a headmaster in monster school, needs you to perform the final test - monster Midterm Exam - in order to prove yourselves to be real monsters. You should collect trash, throw it on people, and scare them! This is a platform game, where you control three characters. Each one of them has a special move that is often used to solve puzzles and overcome obstacles: Ickis can fly for a short time, Oblina can reach high ledges, and Krumm can scan off-screen areas. They can also collect monster books, that will teach them to scare people.
