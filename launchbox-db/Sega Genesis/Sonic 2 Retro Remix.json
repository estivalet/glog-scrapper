{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sonic 2 Retro Remix", "overview": "Sonic 2 Retro Remix is a large-scale ROM hack of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 for the Sega Mega Drive, created by Thorn and DNXDelta. The goal of the project is to create a 2D Sonic the Hedgehog game that requires exploration to progress, as well as the requisite platforming and sheer speed. A mission system akin to those of the 3D Super Mario games is implemented as the means of progressing from one level to the next. Missions involve earning Chaos Emeralds in scavenger hunts, boss battles, speed runs and score attacks; most require learning each level's ins and outs, instead of just finding the easiest way to the goal.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "May 6, 2016", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2WbGZloY5M", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/166103\n"}
