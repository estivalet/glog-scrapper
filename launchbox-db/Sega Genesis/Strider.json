{"altername_name": ["Strider Hiryuu", "Strider Hiry\u016b"], "name": "Strider", "overview": "Take on all the explosive action of the arcade hit! You're Strider, a crunching hulk of muscle with a grappling hook and laser sword. You're in a future land of backward time, and its evil Master is taunting you with defeat. Can you survive 8 megs of incredible danger? Hang-glide into the citadel, then clang your hook into metal to stiff-arm up to safety. Stay alive by slashing armies, winged robots, and prehistoric monsters into shuddering heaps! Battle alluring Amazons who sling vicious boomerangs and drum out a war chant to turn your mind manic. Slide, duck, and cartwheel past lasers, spikes and bombs. Screech to a halt in the face of giant metal monkeys and centipedes. Feel your biceps burst as you grapple with snarling musclemen. Cling to battleship bulkheads. Leap from Tyrannosaurus Rex. It's Strider! The Master awaits!", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "September 29, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.06", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strider_(arcade_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea6nv8Y1Mw4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/679\n"}
