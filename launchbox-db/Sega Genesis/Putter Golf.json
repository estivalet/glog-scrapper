{"altername_name": [], "name": "Putter Golf", "overview": "Putter Golf (\u30d1\u30bf\u30fc\u30b4\u30eb\u30d5) is a golf game developed and published by Sega for the Sega Mega Drive. It was only available in Japan as a download through the Sega Game Toshokan service. Putter Golf is essentially (but whether or not it officially is is unknown) a Mega Drive version of Putt & Putter: a very simple golf game with an isometric perspective. Rather than compete on wide open courts however, the game opts for much smaller levels which would only require a putter (much like minigolf). As well as this, there are a number of obstacles which can get in your way, from bumpers to lava.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "November 3, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.97", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/33676\n"}
