{"altername_name": [], "name": "Predator 2", "overview": "Players guide Lt. Mike Harrigan as he tracks the Predator through seven levels based on the film. Mike's primary concerns are the hostages held around the levels, and the legions of gang members out for blood. He also has to contend with the Predator, both as a boss at the end of each level, and as a time limit - if the player takes too long to rescue a hostage, the Predator will blast the hostage with his tri-laser.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Perfect 10 Productions", "publishers": "Arena Entertainment", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.45", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predator_2_(1992_video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vp0yrynQYhc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4324\n"}
