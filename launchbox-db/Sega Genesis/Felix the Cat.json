{"altername_name": [], "name": "Felix the Cat", "overview": "This game is an unlicensed Russian port of the Famicom/NES game of the same name. The developer is not credited anywhere in the game, but it's known that it was published by KDS (Kudos), alongside some other ports of the NES games. The plot is explained on exactly one screen before the game starts: just like in the Famicom/NES original, Kitty has been kidnapped by the Professor for a ransom, that ransom being Felix's magic bag. Having no other choice, Felix goes on an adventure to rescue his girlfriend. Similarly to all of KDS's NES-to-MD ports, this game features the most basic set of mechanics, enough to resemble Hudson Soft's version. Likewise, this game has no bosses at all, contains only a handful of levels from the original (in this case, 12) and includes the same playlist with songs of different genres and origins, all played at random.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "2012", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "KDS", "publishers": "KDS", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.12", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21dojEGRQOo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73870\n"}
