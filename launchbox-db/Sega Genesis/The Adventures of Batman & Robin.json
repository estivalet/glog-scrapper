{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Adventures of Batman & Robin", "overview": "Based on the award-winning TV series, The Adventures of Batman and Robin pits the player against the diabolical Mr. Freeze who wants to freeze Gotham with a huge ice cannon and his hired help of other Gotham super villains: The Joker, Mad Hatter, and Two-Face. The player can take the role of either Batman or Robin but this choice doesn't make a difference regarding gameplay. This is a side-scrolling action game. The player basically walks from left to right while fighting numerous foes in hand-to-hand combat. Weapons which are found during the levels are used to shoot enemies from a greater distance. These weapons can also be upgraded by picking up the corresponding symbols. There are overall four areas (one for each villain) with three levels each, including a film studio or the Gotham University. While most stages are typical fighting levels with occasional 3D effects there are also a few flying ones where the player uses the Batwing or a jet pack.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "May 1, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Clockwork Tortoise", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.96", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Batman_%26_Robin_(video_game)", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bWAwSRQ7fA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/9050\n"}
