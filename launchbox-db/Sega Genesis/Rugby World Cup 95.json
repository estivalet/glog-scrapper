Boom, the fullback flattens you. Next thing you know 15 lunkers create a human mountain over you and are tearing the ball from you with their cleats.

From the designers of FIFA International Soccer comes the first EA Sports rugby game to combine the hard hitting action of football and the endurance and finesse of soccer. You are on the pitch with the lads trying to kick, ruck, maul, scrum, and dummy your way to the World Cup finals with one of 30 world class teams.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "December 1, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Electronic Arts", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.61", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4364\n"}
