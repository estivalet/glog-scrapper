{"altername_name": ["T-Gun 2"], "name": "T-Gun II", "overview": "TGUN II is a shooter for the Genesis, and it stars two metal hawks named Ruby and Cobalt who traveled through space and came upon a planet named Toal that served as a bird sanctuary. The planet was being devoured by swarms of space insects, and the two hawks fought off the attackers thanks to special powers granted to them by the planet\u2019s phantom bird. Ruby and Cobalt then sat as sentries, protecting the planet for hundreds of orbits until the space insects returned; this time with a new device called the Buzzstar. The game contains seven levels and supports two players. One of the unique aspects of the game is you can shoot forwards and backwards to take out enemies, as well as press the \u201cC button\u201d to change your speed, which also effects how far your projectiles travel.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Many Games", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Fosv5xsq0w&feature=emb_title", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/142889\n"}
