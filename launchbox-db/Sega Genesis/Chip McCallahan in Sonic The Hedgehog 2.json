{"altername_name": [], "name": "Chip McCallahan in Sonic The Hedgehog 2", "overview": "Chip McCallahan in Sonic The Hedgehog 2 is a Sonic 2 hack created by MainMemory. It replaces Sonic the Hedgehog and Tails with Chip McCallahan, the main character in Chip's Challenge. Chip can't run fast, roll or jump high, and rings do not protect him from damage. When you die, you will get one of the death messages from Chip's Challenge, and the level will restart with no decrease in your life count.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "2011", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "MainMemory", "publishers": "", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Dm41oKVyZg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133304\n"}
