{"altername_name": ["Chuck Rock 2", "Chuck II: Son of Chuck"], "name": "Chuck Rock II: Son of Chuck", "overview": "This hero has one tooth and a bad case of diaper rash! When belly-butting Chuck Rock gets snatched, only his six month-old son is ornery enough to go after him. Join the little stinker as he hitchhikes on dinosaurs, swings through jungles and intimidated tigers. Pout. Throw tantrums. Scream your lungs out. If all else fails, hold your breath until you're blue. If that doesn't work, give 'em the old one-two with your trusty club. It's amazing what you can get away with when you're still teething!", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "September 1, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Core Design", "publishers": "Core Design", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.57", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Rock_II:_Son_of_Chuck", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNxT2XGcfec", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4082\n"}
