{"altername_name": ["Junker's High"], "name": "OutRun 2019", "overview": "The basic Outrun game structure is reused in this, with the main difference being that a futuristic setting has been used. The circuits have some spectacular inclines, and the cars do nearly 700km/h. There are four different track sequences on offer, and your aim is to complete each section of track within the time limit. As in the original OutRun game, near the end of each stage there are forks in the road, allowing you to choose different routes within the track sequences. There are other cars on the road to avoid as well.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "March 26, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "SIMS", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.41", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OutRun_2019", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11uHMDNhHxg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4304\n"}
