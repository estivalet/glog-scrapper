{"altername_name": [], "name": "Jeopardy!", "overview": "There is a fine art to watching Jeopardy!, as any know-it-all could tell you. It used to mean shouting and calmly saying \"I knew that...\" Gametek changes all that by giving Jeopardy! fans everywhere an opportunity to really buzz in. Alex Trebek hosts this all-new video game version of television's longest-running game show. Featuring the digitized television studio, theme music, voice and photography of Alex himself, this Jeopardy! takes full advantage of the graphic and sound capabilities of the Sega Genesis. With over 3,500 new questions and answers (or is that answers and questions?) and 700 categories, it's sure to last many seasons without re-runs. Gametek's Jeopardy!, is the smartest game available on the Sega Genesis.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "February 1, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Park Place Productions", "publishers": "GameTek", "genres": "Quiz", "max_players": "3", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.8", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4230\n"}
