{"altername_name": [], "name": "Jimmy White's Whirlwind Snooker", "overview": "\"I've seen most of the other games and this one leaves them all standing. It's almost as if I'm watching myself play on TV. The cue action is just right. The behaviour of the balls, even in the jaws of the pockets, is perfect. Some of the shots the game makes are outrageous, I wish I could play them. I might as well put away my cue for good!\" For the first time on any console: a fully interactive virtual snooker table. View the action from almost any angle and distance through stunning televisual presentation. Any shot that can be played in the real thing can be played here - and then some! The full rules of snooker are incorporated along with a range of skilled opponents, including a simulation of Jimmy White himself! There's never been anything like it for Mega Drive.
