{"altername_name": ["Muscle Bomber: The Body Explosion", "Saturday Night Slam Masters"], "name": "Saturday Night Slammasters", "overview": "It's Saturday night and the Slam Masters have arrived! Ten of the biggest and beefiest wrestlers ever to step into the ring have gathered for one bone-crushing, back-breaking tournament where there are NO RULES! Step into the ring and get ready for no-holds barred wrestling as you bounce your opponents off the ropes and clothesline the fools! Or dare them to take the fight outside the ring where brawls with tables, chairs and bottles are all part of the action. And just when you've got enough muscle, grab a friend and try out the sinister Death Match, where only the ultimate Slam Master can survive the barbed wire ropes and the booby-trapped floor!", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "December 1, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Capcom", "publishers": "Capcom", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.24", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_...", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4370\n"}
