{"altername_name": [], "name": "Outlander", "overview": "The game's setting and style closely resemble the movie The Road Warrior (\"Mad Max 2\"). Your objective is to drive your car through the wasteland, trying to survive motorcycle gang members' attacks and to avoid running out of gas. The gameplay is a split of two genres: racing and side-scrolling. In the racing parts you have to destroy enemies like motorcycle gang members, gyro-copter captains, red trucks, etc. Your car has a machine-gun installed in its front, and if some guy drives along side of you, a little window pops up, allowing you to shoot them with your shotgun.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "March 1, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mindscape", "publishers": "Mindscape", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.45", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlander_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqgG9TXPJr4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4303\n"}
