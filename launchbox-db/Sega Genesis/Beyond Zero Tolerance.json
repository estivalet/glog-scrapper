{"altername_name": ["Zero Tolerance 2"], "name": "Beyond Zero Tolerance", "overview": "Beyond Zero Tolerance is an unreleased Sega Mega Drive sequel to Zero Tolerance. As with its prequel, it is a first person shooter, one of the few available for the system. It is mostly the same game as Zero Tolerance bar new graphics, and is far from being complete. All of the music in the prototype is recycled from the first game. In addition to the Mega Drive version, a Sega 32X port was planned.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Technopop", "publishers": "", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.64", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsTkietGSJs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/22636\n"}
