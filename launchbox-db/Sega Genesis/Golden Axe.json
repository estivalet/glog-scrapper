{"altername_name": [], "name": "Golden Axe", "overview": "In Turtle Village the children are fleeing for their lives! The invaders are brutal, ugly, and 12 feet tall, with huge arms and bellowing laughs. They love pounding you into the dirt! Its a spellbinding age of magic, fire-spewing dragons, and skeletons in armor! Fight on the back of a giant turtle! Battle on the wings of an enchanted eagle! Vanquish and ride flame-breathing monsters to victory! As the Warrior, swing a mighty sword and shatter your enemies with clouds of mushroom magic. As the Amazon, kick, smash, and blast your enemies with curtains of fire. As the Dwarf, strike with the Golden Axe, somersault, and scorch the invaders with lightning! Find the prison of the King and Princess, save them, and return peace to the world. So far, the score is Death Adder - thousands, You - Zero. Its time to change the score!", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "December 22, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.13", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Axe_(video_game)", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiHjrQlO2RQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/199\n"}
