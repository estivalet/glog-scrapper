{"altername_name": [], "name": "Teddy Boy Blues", "overview": "Teddy Boy Blues is an updated conversion of the 1985 Sega coin-op action platformer. While the basic premise is similar to the Master System version -- each stage contains a number of enemy generators, and enemies must be shot and collected before they take a portion of the time meter -- this version of the game has several differences. The graphics have been redrawn to take advantage of the more powerful hardware and the Yohko Ishino tie-in has been removed. There are also several new stages throughout the game, though many of the original game's stages are also present.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.9", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zubzfvzVHF4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/33700\n"}
