{"altername_name": ["Ys: Wanderers from Ys", "Ys III", "Ys III: Wanderers from Ys"], "name": "Ys III", "overview": "Ys III: Wanderers from Ys breaks away from the \"bumping into enemies\" battle system of the first two games, allowing Adol to control his sword in a variety of directions. Beside changing the battle system, the game's perspective switches to a side-scrolling view, as opposed to the top-down one of the previous games. Adol also has the ability to jump now. New to the series is the use of magical rings, which give Adol different powering-up abilities such as healing and shielding. The game also uses various key items found along the way to solve minor puzzles and progress the story.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "November 1, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Telenet Japan", "publishers": "Renovation Products, Inc.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.43", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ys_III:_Wanderers_from_Ys", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4495\n"}
