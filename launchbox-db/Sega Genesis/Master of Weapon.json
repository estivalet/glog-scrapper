{"altername_name": [], "name": "Master of Weapon", "overview": "The \"7-Day War\" -- seven days of nuclear winter -- have caused massive ecological shifts on Earth. The ground splits open, the oceans boil, and all living things on the planet begin to change...including humanity. Scientists create a computer to leave a seed and restore humanity, a computer known simply as \"N\", which is part of the top-secret Project Yukiwo. What is Project Yukiwo? None who know remain... Master of Weapon is a vertically-scrolling shooter. The player controls the fighter ship \"N\", shooting various biological enemies. Power-ups are sparse, with only a handful of upgrades available from item pods. The player can fire in the air, as well as towards the ground to hit land-based enemies. There is also a special weapon which can be changed with power-ups, but also takes time to recharge back to full stock. There are a total of nine \"acts\", and three difficulty settings.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "September 27, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Taito", "publishers": "Taito", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.46", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/33632\n"}
