{"altername_name": [], "name": "Party Quiz Mega Q", "overview": "Party Quiz Mega Q is a general-knowledge quiz game for up to 5 players, themed to look like an over-the-top TV game show. The main attraction is the TV mode, which follows a game show format complete with an intro sequence and commercial breaks (featuring ads for Sega products, of course!). There are a number of different game modes which change regularly -- there may be various effects on the question to make it more difficult to read, or the game may allow only one player to answer a question. Various bonuses or deductions are awarded based on each player's performance in a round, and the player with the most points at the end of the game is the winner. The TV mode follows a specific sequence of quiz modes on each play. There is also a free mode where the player can choose a specific quiz type, rather than following the pre-programmed sequence in the TV mode.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "November 5, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Minato Giken", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Quiz", "max_players": "5", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/19797\n"}
