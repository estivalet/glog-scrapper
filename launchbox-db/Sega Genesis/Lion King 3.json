{"altername_name": ["Shi Zi Wang 3", "Sh\u012bziw\u00e1ng III", "Lion King 3"], "name": "Lion King 3", "overview": "Lion King 3 is a platform game released for the Sega Mega Drive based, not the Disney film of the same name, but the original film itself, as a follow-up to The Lion King II. It was developed by an unknown company likely connected to Chuanpu & Gamtec and published by X Boy. A second release does not credit X Boy but it is unknown if it was published by another company or by X Boy without their logo. In this game, players get the choice of playing as either Simba or Mufasa, although they play identically to one another, through several levels, each with a boss at the end, all while having to contend with various platforming hazards such as floating platforms, swings and all sorts of enemies that obstruct their path. Both lions possess the ability to attack with their claws using the B button and can fire a special attack, a energy wave that shoots straight forward, with the A button. Extra special attacks can be found throughout every level. There is no story in-game and the ending screen is simply a shot of the player's lion gazing out across a lake as the word \"FIN\" appears overhead.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "1997", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gamtec", "publishers": "X Boy", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.92", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/91319\n"}
