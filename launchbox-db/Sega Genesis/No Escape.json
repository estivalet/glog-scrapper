{"altername_name": [], "name": "No Escape", "overview": "Based on the Hollywood action-thriller, NO ESCAPE puts you in the shoes of Robbins, an inmate on the island penal colony of Absollom. Free to travel anywhere on the island - except off! - you'll come face-to-face with ultra-realistic characters rotoscoped from real actors and confront countless deadly traps. You'll be forced to fight or outsmart gangs of savage Outsiders. Only the Insider's Camp gives you a place to rest, exchange information and trade items necessary for your escape. A detailed warden's overhead map lets the player choose which part of the island to explore next. If you gather together the right pieces as you proceed, you'll ultimately confront a final choice... to boldly break free in the prison helicopter or slip quietly away in a specially designed stealth boat. Unlike in the movie, the ending to this story is up to you.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bits Corporation", "publishers": "Psygnosis", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.29", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Escape_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DT9PvuBJdDk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4296\n"}
