{"altername_name": ["Yuu Yuu Hakusho Gaiden", "Y\u016b Y\u016b Hakusho Gaiden", "Yu Yu Hakusho Gaiden"], "name": "Yuu Yuu Hakusho Gaiden", "overview": "Based on the manga and anime series Y\u016b Y\u016b Hakusho, this is a story of a teenager delinquent Yusuke Urameshi, who was hit by a car while trying to save a child. However, there was no place found for him either in paradise or in hell, and Koenma, the son of the death god Enma, sends him back to our world, where he has to be an \"occult detective\", fighting against demons. Several characters join him on his quest: Kazuma Kuwabara, his ex-rival and best friend; Kurama, a 1400-year-old demon fox; and Hiei, formerly a demon who tried to conquer the world and had to repent for his sins by helping Yusuke. You must play the individual chapters of the four playable characters (Yusuke, Kuwabara, Kurama, and Hiei), until in the final chapter you control them all in the ultimate confrontation against evil forces. The game is a Japanese-style adventure (no puzzles, menu-driven interface) with the addition of battles. The battles proceed in real time; the protagonist can kick, punch, defend, and use special techniques. Unlike most Japanese adventures, you view the game world from a third-person perspective, although you cannot move physically.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "January 28, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gau Entertainment", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.86", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/19808\n"}
