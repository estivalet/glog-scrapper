Your character Zoomer (a Pacman lookalike with arms & legs) must trace the outline of the squares on the game board to light them up.

There are various monsters that will try to hunt you down - contact with these costs you energy and eventually a life. There are also a number of power-ups that will aid your quest - quick filling of tiles surrounding the bonus piece, a level skip and bonus points, for example.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "January 13, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Cyclone System", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "2.79", "wikipedia": "https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoom!", "video_link": "https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9OdKHMfLArY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4500\n"}
