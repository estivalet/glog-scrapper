{"altername_name": [], "name": "Virtual Bart", "overview": "Bart's reality goes virtual when he is strapped into Martin Prince's Virtual Reality experiment at the elementary school science fair. Each virtual reality program represents a stage in the game that Bart must play through in order to escape the machine before the programs crash. The game consists of three side-scrolling platform stages and three stages that take place from a rear view. Bart assumes the roles of a pig, dinosaur, and baby for the platform stages. He tosses tomatoes and eggs, slides down a water slide, and drives a motorcycle in a post-apocalyptic Springfield for the three remaining stages. They are all accessed by chance via a wheel-of-misfortune.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "January 1, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sculptured Software", "publishers": "Acclaim Entertainment", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.41", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2452\n"}
