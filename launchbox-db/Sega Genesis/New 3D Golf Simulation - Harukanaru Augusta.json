{"altername_name": [], "name": "New 3D Golf Simulation: Harukanaru Augusta", "overview": "Harukanaru Augusta is a golf game which allows the player to participate in a tournament on the Augusta National course. The interface consists of three windows: the 3D window where the golfer and the ball movement is shown, an overhead map of the hole and a status window which shows where the ball is (e.g. on the green) and the wind direction. The controls follow the usual formula: first the player sets the used club, the feet position and the direction of the shot. Then the power (a moving line on a scale) and the drift (a moving dot on a golf ball) is determined by clicking with the correct timing to stop the line respectively dot.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "December 17, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "T&E Soft", "publishers": "T&E Soft", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.08", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/33361\n"}
