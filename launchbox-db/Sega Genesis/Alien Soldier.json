{"altername_name": [], "name": "Alien Soldier", "overview": "Alien Soldier is a side-scrolling action game in which the player takes the role of Epsilon-Eagle, the former leader of the Scarlet mutant group. The mutants are now lead by the evil Xi-Tiger who had turned them to terrorism, and one of their goals is to kill Epsilon-Eagle... At the start of the game the player chooses four out of six weapons - each with special advantages or disadvantages against certain enemies. As mutant Epsilon-Eagle also has other special powers, e.g. teleporting across the screen or (with full health) morphing into a powerful phoenix destroying everything in his way. The 25 levels consist of short side-scrolling sequences and a few boss fights. In fact the bosses take on the majority of the game and the side-scrolling sequences are mostly used to give the player opportunity to collect ammo boxes. Bosses have their own patterns and weaknesses.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "February 24, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Treasure", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_Soldier", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJNEfPimU40", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2476\n"}
