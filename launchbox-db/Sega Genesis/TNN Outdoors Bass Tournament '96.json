It shares many elements with the PC game of the same name, but that version has an isometric-style map and a full 3D view for the fishing sequences. Just like the original game it is a fishing simulator that allows the player to access a free fishing mode or to participate in a fishing tournament. First, equipment needs to be bought. It consists of lures, rods, reels, lines and boats. Better items can only be acquired by winning money in tournaments.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Imagitec Design", "publishers": "American Softworks", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2440\n"}
