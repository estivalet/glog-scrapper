{"altername_name": [], "name": "Burning Force", "overview": "Deep space. The ultimate combat arena. Only pilots who call themselves \"Space Fighter\" do battle there. That's why you train at Earth University with fellow-student Hiromi. For five rigorous testing days, you maneuver high-speed airbikes and lethal spacefighters within extraordinary 3-D like graphic environments. You skim earth terrain and the ruins of alien civilization, firing missiles and lasers to blaze a trail through hostile robots. Defeat boss enemies by upgrading and replenishing your armaments, and picking up invincibility shielding. If you choose your weapons well and deftly maneuver your vehicle, you'll pass the tests. Then comes deep space combat on the 6th day. Your final exam. Ace this one and the title \"Space Fighter\" is yours.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "October 19, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nova", "publishers": "Namco", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_Force", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ks713a94p4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4071\n"}
