{"altername_name": ["~Hack~ Bigs Fishing Derby"], "name": "Big's Fishing Derby", "overview": "Big's Fishing Derby is a hack of Sonic Classic Heroes for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis by flamewing that allows the player to play as Big the Cat on various fishing levels. Platforming is gone and the game takes place by a series of bodies of water where the player must catch Froggy while avoiding hooking underwater badniks. A second player can also play Eggman, and he competes with Big in the race to catch Froggy. Originally intended to be a secret mini-game in Sonic Classic Heroes, the idea grew beyond its original inception and ended up becoming a game of its own.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "April 30, 2016", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Flamewing", "publishers": "Sonic Retro", "genres": "", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.91", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86098\n"}
