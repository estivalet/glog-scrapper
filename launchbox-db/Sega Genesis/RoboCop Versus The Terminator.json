After RoboCain was destroyed, RoboCop battles his way to the OCP building, where he defeats all the Terminators. After defeating an ED-209 unit reprogrammed by the Terminators, RoboCop plugs himself into a console. Unbeknownst to him, RoboCop gave Skynet information it can use. This ends up with RoboCop falling into a trap. In the future, RoboCop assembles himself, where he battled in the Terminator-infested future and destroyed Skynet. The Mega Drive/Genesis version, which was the original lead development of the game and was programmed by Virgin Games USA making use of David Perry's Mega Drive/Genesis engine, is loosely based on the 1992 four-issue comic book mini-series of the same name.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "December 1, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Virgin Games", "publishers": "Virgin Games", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.11", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RoboCop_Versus_The_Terminator", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNv6r5gMA-A", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4360\n"}
