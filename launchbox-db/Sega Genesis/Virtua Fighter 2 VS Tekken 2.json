{"altername_name": [], "name": "Virtua Fighter 2 VS Tekken 2", "overview": "Virtua Fighter 2 VS Tekken 2 is a pirated game based off Fighters Megamix and Tekken, made for the Mega Drive by an unknown company. Despite the name, this game includes 5 Virtua Fighter 2 characters, 5 Tekken characters and 2 Fighting Vipers characters: Akira, Pai, Wolf, Lion, Shun, Heihachi, Jun, Lee, Paul, Kazuya, Honey and Bahn. The control is poorly designed and the engine is similar to some other games like Tekken 3 Special. The player can only punch and kick, move slowly and jumpkick if the button is pressed at the perfect time. As a result, the game is more difficult than it should be, although in the options the health bars can be modified so that one or both of the players can't take any damage, making it impossible for the opponent to win.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "1997", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gamtec", "publishers": "", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "https://bootleggames.fandom.com/wiki/Virtua_Fighter_2_VS_Tekken_2", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/27492\n"}
