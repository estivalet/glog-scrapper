{"altername_name": ["ATP Tour", "ATP Tour Championship Tennis"], "name": "ATP Tour Championship Tennis", "overview": "There are three game modes: Exhibition match, Exhibition Tournament (where the player competes in a 32-player tournament), ATP Senior Tour Event (where the player chooses one of the retired players and competes in a 8-player tournament) and the ATP Tour, where it's possible to create a player and develop his skills by winning (or simply doing well) on tournaments, with one extra point on each round won. Gameplay uses a simple 3-button layout, where the A button lobs the ball, B performs a controlled passing shot and C allows the fastest top spin shots, with the directional pad affecting the direction and depth of the shot.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "March 1, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "SIMS", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.48", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour_Championship_Tennis", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jMubSjXy3g", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4026\n"}
