Along the way you will battle bumper to bumper with good guys and bad guys, police cars, Porsches and blown engines. Numerous scenes will take you through congested city streets, over snow and icy mountain passes and across sunbaked deserts. Drive daytime and night time - go for manual or auto gearbox selection, even customize your Ferrari F40 with High Grip Tires, but whatever else you do... use the Turbo booster power sparingly - THIS BABY'S HOT AND RARING TO GO!!", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "March 27, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tiertex", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Outrun", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/31618\n"}
