All the kids are wild to play it. It's a machine that surrounds you with flame-belching, body-snatching monsters. Step inside and it's just you against the madness. It's fast, dangerous and almost impossible to beat. One other thing\u2014 its a kid-eater! Until Kid Chameleon takes charge. He bursts open blocks, finds helmets and \u2014 Blam! \u2014 he transforms into a brick-smashing Berzerker. Crunch! He's a buzzing Micromax, hacking Maniaxe, or jet-powered Skycutter. By bashing blocks, he builds up superpowers for the monster-mash ahead! Crabuloids, Skull Chompers, Killer Slime! Kid Chameleon wipes 'em out with hair-raising leaps. He scrambles up walls, skates across ceilings and squeezes through escape holes. With more than 1,850 screens, 103 levels, and loads of secret paths, there's always a way out. And they all lead to the lair of the Elsewhere Evilmeister, Heady Metal!", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "May 28, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Sega Technical Institute", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.12", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kid_Chameleon", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtcbZ23szcI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4241\n"}
