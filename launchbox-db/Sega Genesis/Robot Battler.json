{"altername_name": [], "name": "Robot Battler", "overview": "Robot Battler is a simple action simulation game where the player builds a robot and pits it against another. In building their robot, the player must first distribute points to five different stats, and then may also purchase weapon and body parts. Once the setup is complete, it's off to battle. The player directly controls the robot in battle, moving it around the arena and attacking with its weapons (if any are equipped). Using the weapons will deplete the robot's energy, though direct contact between the two robots will damage both of them, and is a viable attack if the energy is depleted. If the player's robot is victorious, additional stat points and money are earned, and the player moves on to the next fight.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/82428\n"}
