{"altername_name": [], "name": "Street Fighter II': Hyper Champion Edition", "overview": "Final version of the SF2 Hyper Champion Edition Hack that I have been working. Intense graphic hack with additions in all scenarios. The purpose is for the MD version to be as faithful to the arcade as possible. Comparison of the original version of MD published on March, 1992, and the hack. Includes audio hack from Stephan Dagondeville. The music that sounds in the video, are not those of the game itself, and are the work of Savaged Regime, Mr.Destructor90, and a few more. :)", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "December 24, 2020", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "", "developers": "Pyron", "publishers": "Romhacking.net", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.67", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_Fighter_II:_Champion_Edition", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwHAwDbYKbc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148501\n"}
