{"altername_name": [], "name": "Midnight Resistance", "overview": "You're the toughest soldier in the Resistance. That's why the Evil Head snatched your family. You're outnumbered, but not outsmarted. You and a three-barrel machine gun are gonna even the score! Bash into Evil Head's compound, battling tanks, missiles and flying robots in skull-to-skull combat. Crawl through bullet-filled corridors, stomp through flak-laden forests, swing down ladders and dive off ledges to ambush the evil army. The enemy hammers you with heavy artillery, rapid-fire lasers and slashing sawblades. You pound them with flamethrowers, nitro bombs and machine guns - your explosive-tipped bullets tear into their armor. The Head's forces are vicious and armed to the eye sockets. So what! Climb, leap and snarl through 7 levels of explosive action. Nothing can stop your rage!", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "March 29, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Opera House", "publishers": "Data East", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.44", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight_Resistance", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0raazFIkOg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/629\n"}
