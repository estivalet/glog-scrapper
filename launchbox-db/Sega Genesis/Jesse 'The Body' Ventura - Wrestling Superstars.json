It was sponsored by professional wrestler Jesse Ventura. Little is known about the history of Jesse Ventura Wrestling Superstars. DreamWorks announced the game at Winter CES 1991, began advertising it in the Spring of 1991, and also took it to Summer CES 1991, but each time only released a couple of screenshots. The game was developed by Human, authors of the long-running Fire Pro Wrestling series, and much of the game's content was recycled for the 1992 release of Thunder Pro Wrestling Retsuden, a Japanese exclusive. A prototype ROM has since been leaked with a 1992 copyright.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Human", "publishers": "", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106861\n"}
