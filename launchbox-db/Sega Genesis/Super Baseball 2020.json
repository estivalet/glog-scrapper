There is no longer conventional professional baseball in 2020. Baseball designed by the Super Baseball Association has been very popular and is the best sport. However, the truth is that the association has used a colossal sum of money to promote Super Baseball as show business. They have manipulated each player's ability using the control computer to secretly decide victory or defeat in every game. The players who knew this removed the connecting parts of the computer to play their own game of baseball. Finally, a fair game is going to be played at Cyber Egg Stadium. Super Baseball 2020 is a fast-paced game with new rules, where you can select 1 of 12 individual men, women, or robot players. During play, you can make your team stronger with prizes earned from amazing catches.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "September 24, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "NuFX", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.89", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Baseball_2020", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vv1YcNzcBY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4397\n"}
