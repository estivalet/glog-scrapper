{"altername_name": [], "name": "Divine Sealing", "overview": "Falchion is an ace pilot in the Space Defense Force, and the pilot of a space ship known as Divine. On his way back to his home planet, daydreaming about girls, Divine's computer picks up a transmission from a nearby planet. Answering the transmission, it turns out to be a distress call from a beautiful woman on the Water Planet. \"Save me...\" she pleads, \"and I will lend you my power.\" Falchion, lonely bachelor in space that he is, can't say no to a pretty face, and flies off towards the Water Planet. Divine Sealing is a basic vertically-scrolling shooter with adult content. The player controls the spaceship Divine, and shoots a variety of enemies. There are no bombs or powerups, but every 10,000 points the player is awarded with an extra life and a firepower upgrade. A boss appears at the end of each stage which must be destroyed. After defeating a boss, the player will meet up with one of four girls, who are then shown in various states of undress as Falchion \"borrows their power\".", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "M - Mature", "developers": "Studio Fazzy", "publishers": "Studio Fazzy", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.59", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/33599\n"}
