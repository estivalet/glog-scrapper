Each vessel has its own maneuvering and firing characteristics, plus a unique special power that you can employ when circumstances dictate. The game has two modules: the Melee, in which you can simply blast the computer or another player to smithereens using one of 16 different ships, in either Hierarchy or Alliance fleets; or, should you wish for a more challenging game, lets you play one of 9 preset scenarios.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "June 1, 1991", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Toys for Bob", "publishers": "Ballistic", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Control", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/525\n"}
