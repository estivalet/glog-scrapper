{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cyberball", "overview": "Bash your way to the goal post in Cyberball, the national sport of the 21st century. Massive Robots grapple for yardage on this metal-crunching gridiron of the future. And when the action gets critical, the ball explodes! Classic football tactics and plays burn up the field in a game too dangerous for referees. Penalties are passe! Your linemen are cyborg battering rams who only leave the game when their heads blow off! Choose from over 100 plays to battle the charging defense. Apply Turbo Boost to push your offense to the limit. Then block a Quarterback sneak with one of 12 defensive formations. Or just plain blitz! When Robots burst into flying debris, buy faster, tougher, meaner models. Speed the 350-pound bomb from kick off to touchdown! Take an end run into the future-- and don't fumble!", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "June 1, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.91", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberball", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4095\n"}
