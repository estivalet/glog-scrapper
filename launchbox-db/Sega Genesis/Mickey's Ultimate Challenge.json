{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mickey's Ultimate Challenge", "overview": "One night, as Mickey (or Minnie) lay in bed reading a book of fairy tales, he started to wonder how it would be to live in a far off land, in a magic castle. As he fell asleep, he woke up in the Kingdom of Beanwick, which is constantly tormented by earthquakes. Then, he offers his help to solve the mystery behind those earthquakes. Mickey's Ultimate Challenge is a puzzle game in which the player chooses either Mickey or Minnie to play with. They'll find five characters from the Disney's universe in the kingdom, and will be prompted to help them in several tasks. Each task is a different puzzle, given by a specific character. Daisy, for instance, will ask help to clean the castle's paintings hanging on a wall. The task is in fact a memory game, where Mickey or Minnie must clean the pictures matching pairs. After completing one task, they'll receive a gift.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Designer Software", "publishers": "Hi-Tech Expressions", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey%27s_Ultimate_Challenge", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_RNSaugnhw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4267\n"}
