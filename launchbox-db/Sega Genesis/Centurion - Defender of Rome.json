{"altername_name": [], "name": "Centurion: Defender of Rome", "overview": "Centurion: Defender of Rome is a turn-based strategy game. You start with one province, Rome, and one legion. To complete the game, you have to conquer all the provinces on the map. One part of the game is micro-managing your provinces. You set up tax rates and make people happy by organizing games. In Rome, you can organize a chariot race, a gladiatorial combat or even a simulated naval battle; this starts an action mini-game where you control the chariot rider, gladiator or ship. Another part of the game is military conquest. You can raise legions or strengthen them in any province you control (let's just hope there are enough men in the province, or your legion will be incomplete and weaker). There are three types of legions, each of them has a different strength. You can also move a legion to a neighbouring province.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "June 1, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bits of Magic", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.31", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centurion:_Defender_of_Rome", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqS0gL1ngos", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/442\n"}
