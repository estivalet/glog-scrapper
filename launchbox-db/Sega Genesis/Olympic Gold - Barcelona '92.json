It's the Olympic Summer Games, and your once in a lifetime chance to prove yourself in the world arena. You'll hear the crowd, feel the heat and experience the total rush of the ultimate competition. Break a world record. Smash an Olympics Game record. Or beat a friend. Here's the rundown: Hammer Throw - Trajectory, speed, angle of descent, you get the idea. Don't you wish you paid attention in physics? 100 Meter Spring - You'll need a fast start and warp speed to have a shot at the gold. Springboard Diving - Four required dives and one you improvise. Scores based on difficulty, execution, and entry into water. Pole Vaulting - The hardest event. Plant the pole and time your release to clear record heights. 110 Meter Hurdles - Timing your jumps is everything in this event. 200 Meter Freestyle Swimming - Bang those turns but conserve your strength to sprint for the gold. Archery - The farther you pull the bow, the harder to hold your aim steady.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "July 24, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tiertex", "publishers": "U.S. Gold", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.17", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Gold_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaiY3bFW1y4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/647\n"}
