Proco and Tiat, two survivors of Belser's evil quest, escaped and fled to the planet Orga where they began a new civilization. Centuries later, the descendants of Proco and Tiat received a strange radio signal emitted from a distant part of their galaxy. To their amazement, it was a May Day signal from another line of Darius descendants who also had survived Belser's terrible assault.
