In the final room of the first title, the intrepid young explorer finds a stone tablet, which directs him to another part of the pyramid. He must now make his way back through the pyramid, once more in search of the treasure. The gameplay elements are identical to the first game: collect the keys and reach the exit of each room without crushing or trapping the explorer. The ability to skip two stages returns, and there are 35 new puzzles to solve.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/33683\n"}
