{"altername_name": [], "name": "The NewZealand Story", "overview": "One day, a kiwi tribe was having fun and games outside the zoo, only to be kidnapped by the evil-minded Leopard Seal, who plans to sell them at the black market. Fortunately, during the kidnapping process, Tiki, leader of the tribe, managed to escape the sack, and her job is to rescue Phee-Phee and the other kiwis scattered around New Zealand, and are held in cages in various locations that include Auckland, Rotorua, Waitomo Caves, Strait Cook, and Mt. Cook. This Mega Drive port of The NewZealand Story is unique in that it was based on a prototype revision of the Japanese arcade board, leading to radically different level designs which lack the on-screen map for navigation. There are also fewer levels; 13 versus the 20 seen in other ports. This version is considered to be harder, as Tiki takes less time to drown underwater while enemies are faster and more aggressive.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "March 3, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Visco", "publishers": "Taito", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/33642\n"}
