{"altername_name": ["Super Mario World"], "name": "Super Mario Bros.", "overview": "Super Mario Bros., also known as Super Mario World (the game has both title screens) is a hack of Squirrel King. Chip and Dale were replaced with the Mario Bros although this time around, you can't choose between the two. The first two acts are replaced with levels from the Super Mario Bros. and Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels, with Bowser serving as the boss at the end of each one. Everything else remains the same as Squirrel King, including the gameplay - this means elements such as the pipes and blocks in the \"Mario\" stages do not function at all.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gamtec", "publishers": "", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.84", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106904\n"}
