{"altername_name": [], "name": "Blockbuster World Video Game Championship II", "overview": "In 1995 Blockbuster organized their second Video Game Championship. There were two categories, up to 13 and over 14 years old. Contestants chose to compete on the SNES or SEGA Genesis. From June 14th to July 9th there was a Store Championship Competition, then the WVGC-Finals. Each store awarded a Store Champion with a prize of free rentals for the next two years (two games a month). The best eleven players then won a trip to San Francisco for the final fight in August, inside the GamePro (gaming magazine) HQ. The cartridge was built by Acclaim Entertainment for North American units, and contains trimmed down versions of NBA Jam Tournament Edition and Judge Dredd, both released the same year. This cartridge is exceptionally rare, as only a handful were ever produced and the cartridge was ordered to be destroyed after use. Regardless, many cartridges have appeared on the internet, with the most recent being sold at auction for over $2000 USD.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Iguana Entertainment", "publishers": "Acclaim Entertainment", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzGH-AHk5Bw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4061\n"}
