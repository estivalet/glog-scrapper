In a distant galaxy, a monstrous entity watches and waits. Though his purposes are beyond the understanding of mankind, the mighty Hastur lives only to destroy, with the power to easily obliterate an entire planet. On Earth, he is worshiped as a god by a bizarre cult called the Hastur Group, whose evil purpose is simple: to summon Hastur to Earth, so that civilization may be wiped out and a new order begun - an order dictated by the cult of Hastur! To summon Hastur, the cult plans to use the newly-built Empire State Building as a sacrificial shrine. The only person alive who can stop them is Annet, a young sorceress from the mountains of Peru, who has telepathically harnessed a portion of Hastur's vast power. She controls the elements of the air, possessing the magic of El Viento...The Wind. But the Hastur Group has enlisted the aid of the most dangerous mob of its day: the gangsters of Vincente DeMarco, New York's supreme underworld kingpin. Your battle will be fought in the speakeasies, factories, streets and sewers of New York, against a merciless and deadly horde of thugs and assassins. Prepare yourself to wield the mind-boggling elemental power of El Viento!", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "September 20, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Wolf Team", "publishers": "Renovation Products, Inc.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.09", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Viento", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/_4F0THtN_og", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4125\n"}
