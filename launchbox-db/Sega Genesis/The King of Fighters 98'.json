{"altername_name": ["98 Gedou Wang", "King of Fighters 2000"], "name": "The King of Fighters 98'", "overview": "King of Fighters 98', also known as 98 Gedou Wang and later reissued as King of Fighters 2000, is an unlicensed Sega Mega Drive fighting game. It should not be confused with the \"real\" The King of Fighters '98 which bypassed Sega consoles. Though the name would suggest The King of Fighters '98 is an attempt to port official game to the Mega Drive, it is actually a completely original fighter. Some stages are stolen from official games in the series, but the cast of characters also includes fighters seen in the Street Fighter series.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "1998", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "X Boy", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrUg0KTQXgA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/105120\n"}
