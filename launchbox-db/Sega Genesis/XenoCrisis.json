{"altername_name": ["XenoCrisis", "Xeno Crisis"], "name": "XenoCrisis", "overview": "An arena shooter for up to 2 players that takes inspiration from the likes of Smash TV, Contra, Mercs, Granada, Alien Syndrome, Zombies Ate My Neighbours, Chaos Engine, and Shock Troopers. The game look, feel and sound like the classic Mega Drive games of the '80s and '90s, but it adds some new elements that weren't so common in games of that era, particularly procedural map generation and randomisation of gameplay elements. Graphically designed by the legendary pixel artist Henk Nieborg, who previously worked on the Mega Drive title \"The Misadventures Of Flink\", developed by Psygnosis. To complete the 90's comeback, the OST has been created by \"Savaged Regime\"; a highly renowned chip-tune artist that knows how to push the Mega Drive's YM2612 chip to the limit.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "October 28, 2019", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bitmap Bureau", "publishers": "Bitmap Bureau", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.61", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zANM1GUZ1m4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/121998\n"}
