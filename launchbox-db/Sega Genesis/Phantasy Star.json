{"altername_name": ["Phantasy Star: Fukkokuban", "Phantasy Star"], "name": "Phantasy Star", "overview": "Phantasy Star is a 1987 role-playing game developed and published by Sega. It is the first in a long line of Phantasy Star games, and is often considered one of the best games for the Sega Master System. In 1994, Sega released a version for the Sega Mega Drive, Phantasy Star Fukkokuban. This version is merely the Master System version on a Mega Drive cartridge PCB with the appropriate connector pin to signal Master System mode changed accordingly (which is how pass-through devices like the Power Base Converter work). The situation behind this release is unknown; the most prominent rumor is that it was a contest giveaway.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "April 2, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.1", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantasy_Star_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc4w9zvfB5Q", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40941\n"}
