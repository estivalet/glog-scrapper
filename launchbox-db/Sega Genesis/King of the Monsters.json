Battles end when one of the monsters is pinned for a three count or if time expires (in which case the player loses). The game consists of 8 total levels: the player first must defeat all four monsters, with the last monster being oneself, but in a different palette. Then the player must defeat the four monsters again, in the same order, but this time in different cities.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "March 1, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "SPS", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.19", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_the_Monsters", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkpK6dcBn7o", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/61628\n"}
