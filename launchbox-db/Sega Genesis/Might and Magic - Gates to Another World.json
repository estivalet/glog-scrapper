{"altername_name": ["Might and Magic II: Gates to Another World"], "name": "Might and Magic: Gates to Another World", "overview": "Gates to Another World is the second installment in the Might and Magic series, and a sequel to Secret of the Inner Sanctum. Core gameplay is similar to it's predecessor, with the player creating a party of six characters and exploring vast first-person 3D environments, while fighting enemies in turn-based combat and leveling up. Unlike the first game, enemy encounters occur at set points rather than spawning randomly, though enemy type selection is still random.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "July 1, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "New World Computing", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.32", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Might_and_Magic_II:_Gates_to_Another_World", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIR1mPzggaE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4270\n"}
