It is shown from a top-down perspective and all units are represented by icons on the square fields of the playing map. The basic gameplay is simple: on each of the four levels there are goals to fulfill, e.g. destroying pirate ships. To do so, the player chooses a unit and gives it the order to move somewhere. When hostile units meet, they fight automatically; the fights are shown in separate windows.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "February 24, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Micronet", "publishers": "Micronet", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.43", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4466\n"}
