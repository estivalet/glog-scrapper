You shove boxes for a living. This morning you met the girl of your dreams, but to get to her you'll need the car of your dreams! And that means working overtime and using your head. Now you've got a big job ahead of you, 16 levels, 160 warehouses that need to have their boxes shoved into order. Each room is a puzzle that takes skill, strategy and your wits to solve. As you progress, the warehouses get harder. It's addictive! Once you start you can't stop. Some warehouses may seem impossible, but there is a solution to each one. To help you there is a \"trace mode\" to retrace your steps and passwords to access each level, once you've earned that level. You can even design your own warehouses to stump your friends. If you can beat all 16 levels, a brand new sports car ... and the girl ... will be yours. Fail and you'll be yelling Shove It!", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "January 30, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "NCS", "publishers": "DreamWorks", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/673\n"}
