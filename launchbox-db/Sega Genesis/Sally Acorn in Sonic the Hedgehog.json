{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sally Acorn in Sonic the Hedgehog", "overview": "This is a hack which replaces the main character with Sally Acorn of SatAM and Comic Book fame in the original Sonic the Hedgehog for Genesis. Sally is slower than Sonic and can't use spin attacks; however, she has a number of stealth and agility-based abilities to compensate and access areas Sonic had difficulty reaching, as well as the use of handheld device NICOLE. She has the following moves: *NICOLE Laser Attack: Press A and Sally uses NICOLE to fire a small projectile which hits nearby enemies and obstacles. *NICOLE Scan Mode: Press B and NICOLE will send a data wave to reprogram monitors and other Eggman traps. *NICOLE Downward Laser: Press Down + A/B while airborne to fire at objects straight below. Sally also gets a small vertical boost. *Slide: Press Down while running to slide on the ground for a short distance. Sally can also slide under certain obstacles using this method. *Somersault Dash: Press Down + B/C while on the ground and Sally will somersault forward at a high speed. This is useful for jumping long distances.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "October 19, 2015", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161338\n"}
