And civilized man was almost destroyed. But the Dark Forces still remain. Conquer these monstrous mutations. Fight them with swords, knives, bows - even your wits. You live and die by them. Trek through 7 distant lands - some friendly, some not. Transform into an aerojet and fly over snow-capped mountains. Or become a submersible or aquaskimmer and cross vast oceans and raging rivers. Then find and fight your way through danger-laden dungeons. Embark on a journey so vast, it spans the lives of three generations. Begin with Maia, spirited away by a winged dragon on your wedding day. Experience one of our four endings that will surprise new and former Phantasy Star players alike.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "April 21, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.83", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantasy_Star_III", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-lUy4egSw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/656\n"}
