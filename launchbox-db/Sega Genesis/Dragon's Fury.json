Your hero is a small silver ball, and your battlefield is a three-tiered pinball machine. Using your ball, you can defeat monsters, rack up points, and enter bonus stages. If you play with enough skill, you can trigger all sorts of point-accumulating bonuses. If you get one billion points, you get to fight the final boss and view the ending to the game.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "October 10, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Technosoft Co., Ltd.", "publishers": "Technosoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.14", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil%27s_Crush", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H870SlLDlUw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4116\n"}
