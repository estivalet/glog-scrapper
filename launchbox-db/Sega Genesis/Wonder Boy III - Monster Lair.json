{"altername_name": [], "name": "Wonder Boy III: Monster Lair", "overview": "Released in Japan and Europe for the Mega Drive. Wonder Boy III: Monster Lair is a quite different game to most of the games in the Wonder Boy series. You play a green-haired dude who must attack the invaders that attempt to collect weapons and use them to destroy the land. The game starts out like a simple platform game, but it's just when Wonder Boy enters the skull further on that the game is transformed into a shoot 'em up, so basically the gameplay consists of action and shooter scenes.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "December 22, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.72", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonder_Boy_III:_Monster_Lair", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql_0xSykbbY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4481\n"}
