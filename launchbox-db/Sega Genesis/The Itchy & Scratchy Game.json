{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Itchy & Scratchy Game", "overview": "Unreleased for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive, Itchy & Scratchy is a single player platform sidescroller. The player controls Itchy, the mouse, and must defeat Scratchy, the cat, with a variety of weapons. Itchy caries a default mallet, but can pick up additional weapons on particular levels. Each of the seven levels takes place in a different fictional location and is designed as a maze of doors and platforms. After defeating Scratchy, he usually will return with a special contraption to attack Itchy, and must therefore be defeated again.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bits Studios", "publishers": "", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.03", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Itchy_%26_Scratchy_Game", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II4rFtKAFqQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/286\n"}
