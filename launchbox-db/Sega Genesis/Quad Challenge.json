{"altername_name": ["MegaTrax", "Quad Challenge"], "name": "Quad Challenge", "overview": "Saddled on a high-performance all-terrain vehicle, you hear the roar of racing engines and scan the brutal dirt track ahead. The unforgiving clock counts down; THREE... strap helmet, TWO... rev it up, ONE... explode from the gate! Slam into high, and torque up to brain-warping speed! During tight cornering, cut hard, shift low, and fan the brakes. You'll feel huge racing tires claw for traction. Control four-wheel drift or you'll spin out. On straightways, you'll hit rises and go airborne. Throttle down to soften your landing. Challenge a computer-controlled rival, or compete head-to-head against your buddy. Choose from 9 twisting race tracks on practice mode. Choose from 4 vehicles, each with unique horsepower, handling, and acceleration features. Play the Circuit Championship, a 16 track password race to glory!", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "August 6, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Now Production", "publishers": "Namco", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.14", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8E8jcti1JU0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4342\n"}
