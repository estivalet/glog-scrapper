{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tel-Tel Stadium", "overview": "Tel-Tel Stadium is a baseball game with generic Japanese teams. The main draw of this particular version is online play through a phone line, but this service has long since been discontinued. Unlike many baseball games, Tel-Tel Stadium takes a rather hands-off approach to the action, allowing the player to give commands to the batter, pitcher, and fielders rather than directly controlling them. In addition to the now-defunct online mode, it can be played single-player offline with an exhibition match, as well as a \"pennant mode\" where the player builds their own team and plays through a full season. There is also the option to watch a computer-controlled match.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "October 21, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sunsoft", "publishers": "Sunsoft", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.7", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/19889\n"}
