{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mario Lemieux Hockey", "overview": "Check him out... Mario rips towards you. Check him into the glass. Nab the puck. Pass to an open winger for the give-&-go. Then break free at mid-ice to connect. And slam home a 90 mph slapshot. Close up. It's life-sized, gut-tightening action. He steals the puck, turns it up ice. You unload a body-crushing check. He drops his gloves... It's a fight! A jab. An uppercut. A roundhouse. And there's the whistle! Lose, and you chill out in the penalty box. You're drafted. Play on one of 16 fast and furious teams from Montreal to L.A. Pull from three sets of frontliners. Between periods, flip through 14 pages of hot stats. Major stuff. Major mayhem. After all, you're playing with Mario Lemieux!", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Alpine Studios", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.92", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4259\n"}
