The generals told him there was a mortal woman in the empire whose beauty matched that of N\u00fc Wa. After prolonged searching the Emperor's men found the girl and brought her to the palace. What they did not know was that the girl's body was possessed by a fox spirit. Since she became Emperor Zhou's wife, evil has entered the empire. It is time for the great heroes of China to free the country from the corrupted Zhou and his possessed wife!

The game is a strategy RPG which consists of battles and cutscenes to advance the story. Navigation is possible only during battles, or as instant travel between locations on a world map. During the battles, the player moves the heroes over the top-down battlefield, attacking enemies physically, defending, or using magic whenever enemies are in range. Characters gain experience points every time they attack an enemy, so it is possible to level up in the middle of a battle.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Chuanpu Technologies", "publishers": "Chuanpu Technologies", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/82476\n"}
