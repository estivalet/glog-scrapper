{"altername_name": [], "name": "16t", "overview": "16t is a 1991 action game for the Sega Mega Drive by Sega released exclusively on the Sega Game Toshokan service (and on the various compilations that package such games). You play as a computer programmer who goes into his bugged program to debug it by squishing the bugs with 16-ton weights. Levels are a series of platforms that wrap around both horizontally and vertically. A and C jump and B throws a 16-ton weight. You can only throw a certain number of weights at a time; the number is shown at the bottom of the screen. The level ends when you crush all the enemies. Getting crushed or getting hit once causes you to lose a life.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.48", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KLei3eIXiE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/33130\n"}
