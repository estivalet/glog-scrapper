{"altername_name": [], "name": "Syndicate", "overview": "Syndicate for Nintendo and Sega systems adapts the computer original for the capabilities of the consoles. While it follows the same gameplay template, it is redesigned in a much more cartoony style, has multiple differences in gameplay and controls and features completely new levels. Taking the role of an executive of a criminal syndicate in a dark cyberpunk future, the player controls teams of cyborg agents on missions: assassinating politicians, opinion leaders or executives from rival syndicates, retrieving important objects, kidnapping scientists or taking out enemy agents. The world map consists of 50 regions, each containing one level (two training levels are also available). The stages are presented in isometric view, and one to four agents are controlled. Unlike the indirect cursor control in the computer versions, on the consoles the agents are controlled directly, with potential targets being selected automatically. Unlike the multi-layered versions of the computer game, all levels consist of one layer only.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "June 6, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bullfrog Productions", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.57", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndicate_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/683\n"}
