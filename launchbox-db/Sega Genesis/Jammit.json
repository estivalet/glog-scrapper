{"altername_name": [], "name": "Jammit", "overview": "Okay, here are the rules - there are none! No stats. No squeaky-clean courts, high priced players or NBA (Nerds and Babies Association) rules. This is JAMMIT - where you play on the streets and push to the limit. FLAUNT IT. Man, you look too good. Forget those robots in jerseys. We used digitized players for this game. TAUNT IT. Tell 'em to back off, pay up or front this. Or shut up and let the ball do the dissin'. SHOVE IT. Hey, you do what it takes to win. And sometimes it takes a jab in the ribs and a push in the back. PICK IT. 1 or 2 player action. 3 killer opponents. 8 different 1-on-1 games. SLAM IT. \"Slam Cam\" lets you show off your dunking moves from the view of the brutalized basket. KEEP IT. Passwords save your best games. Just in case some fool doubts how good you really are. FACE IT. You're gonna get a little dirty. And this game's gonna get a lot dirty. GET IT?
