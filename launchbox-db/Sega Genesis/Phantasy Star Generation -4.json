{"altername_name": [], "name": "Phantasy Star Generation:4", "overview": "Phantasy Star Generation:4 is a comprehensive retranslation and relocalization of Phantasy Star IV, utilizing fan-translated scripts and resources, all created by a professional writer/editor team. As SEGA canceled \u201cPhantasy Star Generation:4\u2033 many years ago, this project aimed to create a definitive, series-ending Phantasy Star experience. Goals: \u2022 Restore every mistranslated connection to the other PS games \u2022 Incorporate The Cutting Room Floor\u2019s retranslation notes to best express Japanese creators\u2019 intent in all dialog. \u2022 A more colloquial, fun, and emotional script (from NPCs to main story) \u2022 Add PS lore gathered from PS team interviews and official SEGA resources \u2022 Add depth to character personalities and relationships \u2022 Explain the few plot holes and character choices that had been given no in-game reasoning (see project site for details \u2013 spoilers) \u2022 Proper grammar and capitalization \u2022 Include lory1990 bugfixes NEW: Added dialog to 3 story scenes connecting one of the major antagonists to a party member, per an unearthed, recent developer interview. We now have a clearer understanding of these two characters\u2019 motivations, and as well as how they came to be where they are at the start of PSIV.
