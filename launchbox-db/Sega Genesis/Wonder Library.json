{"altername_name": [], "name": "Wonder Library", "overview": "Wonder Library is a very rare Sega Mega Drive cartridge which shipped with some variants of the Japanese Wondermega. When hooked up to a Mega Drive connected to the Sega Mega-CD (or a Wondermega), a specific but presently unknown (possibly Sony-made, JVC-made, or Aplix-made) type of book-on-CD can be played. As with other Wondermega-related products, the cartridge features Wonder Dog heavily. It is unknown whether or not any emulator can use a cart-boot feature to run this game (some do support Flux, which works similarly, so it is possible).", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Victor", "publishers": "Victor", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/19812\n"}
