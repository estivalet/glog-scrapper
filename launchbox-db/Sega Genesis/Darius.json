{"altername_name": [], "name": "Darius", "overview": "A two-dimensional horizontally scrolling shoot 'em up set in a fictional future. The player controls an ornate fighter spacecraft, named the Silver Hawk, and must navigate through scrolling terrain while battling a variety of fighter craft, ground vehicles, turrets, and other obstacles throughout the game's stages (referred to as zones in the game). The ship's arsenal consists of forward-firing missiles, aerial bombs and a protective force field, all of which can be upgraded by power-ups (in the form of large, colored orbs) that are dropped by specially-colored enemies throughout the game's zones. When the player reaches the end of a zone, a boss appears, which must be defeated to proceed. Once the boss of a zone is destroyed, the player is given a choice of which zone to play next via a branching path. While there are 28 zones in total, only seven can be played in a single run", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "September 19, 2019", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "M2 Co., Ltd.", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.94", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darius_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp06WFtkSV0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/121596\n"}
