{"altername_name": ["Wacky Races", "Los Autos Locos", "Autos Locos, Los"], "name": "Wacky Races", "overview": "Wacky Races for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive is an unreleased racing game developed by Eden Entertainment Software and is based on the TV franchise. Though never released onto store shelves, a prototype of the game has since emerged on the internet. You take on the role of Dastardly and Mutley from the Hanna-Barbera cartoon series in this action title with superficial racing overtones. Your aim is to complete each course in a particular position, which is achieved either by waiting for them to suffer enough damage to drop out of the race, or by inflicting that damage yourself. Your car is armed with a forward-shooting arrow to impale the opposition cars, and deal with the many hazards the races throw at you, including boulders and rabbits, which can be taken out for points.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Eden Entertainment Software", "publishers": "Virgin Games", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.72", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/9019\n"}
