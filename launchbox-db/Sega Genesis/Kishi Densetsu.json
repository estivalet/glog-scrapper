{"altername_name": [], "name": "Kishi Densetsu", "overview": "Kishi Densetsu (Soldier Legend) is a tactical simulation game where the player commands a German Nazi SS tank corp during World War II. It follows many of the major battles of the European Theater starting with the invasion of Poland, through to the Battle of Berlin, sticking closely to historical fact. Before each map, the player can select the equipment and troops to deploy. Once in the field, the game is controlled primarily through menu-based commands, such as move, fire, or retreat. The game does not take place in real-time, but rather a continuous progression that can be paused. Depending on the outcome of each stage, the progression of the scenario may change slightly.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "July 30, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kodansha Research Institute", "publishers": "Kodansha Research Institute", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.6", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/19773\n"}
