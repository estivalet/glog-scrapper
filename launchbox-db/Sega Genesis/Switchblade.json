{"altername_name": ["Switch Blade MD"], "name": "Switchblade", "overview": "The Fireblade, sacred symbol of the ancient Switchblade clan, has been smashed into 16 pieces by the evil Havoc - but they say that a Hiro can save it, and as Hiro, you must retrieve the 16 pieces and restore your people's pride. The gameplay is platform and ladders based, set both inside and outside. The layout of the territories becomes visible as you progress, and they can contain bonus weapons and secret rooms. Unlike the sequel you start without weaponry, and this is gained directly, rather than you collecting coins and trading them at shop sections. Holding down fire progressively builds up your fighting power.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "April 15, 2019", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Segaman Production", "publishers": "Piko Interactive LLC", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switchblade_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8asrcrF3eg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/122384\n"}
