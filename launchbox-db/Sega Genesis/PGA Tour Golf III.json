{"altername_name": [], "name": "PGA Tour Golf III", "overview": "The team at Polygames make some small improvements to the series in PGA Tour Golf III. It has a US setting in terms of the courses and players, unlike PGA European Tour, with 8 licensed courses in total: Avenel, Las Colinas, River Highlands, Sawgrass, Scottsdale, Southwind, Summerlin and The Woodlands. Gameplay modes include three different practice options (driving range, putting green, and a full round) as well as a tournament, skins challenge, match play, and shoot-out. Gameplay follows the standard model with swings made from of a view behind the golfer, with the customary three-click method (start, power, accuracy). Before taking a shot, the club choice, direction and intended draw/fade (spin on the ball) are selected. The game features instant replays and user-created players, stats and tournaments saved to battery-backed RAM. Only the Genesis version has course flybys with tips from PGA pros and switches to a different camera view for the ball's landing.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "High Score Productions", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.79", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YY_fI9Tu_7Y", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4317\n"}
