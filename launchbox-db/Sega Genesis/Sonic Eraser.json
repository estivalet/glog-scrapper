{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sonic Eraser", "overview": "Sonic Eraser is a puzzle game very similar to Columns that features Sega mascot Sonic the Hedgehog. Pieces in different arrangements drop into a well; if two or more matching pieces touch, they disappear and the above pieces fall to take their place. There are four different single-player game modes: Round: Each stage starts with pieces in the well already. There are several spinning green pieces, which must all be destroyed to finish the stage. Normal: A standard endless mode in which the game speed continually rises as matches are made. Doubt: No white-colored blocks will appear in the drop formations, but often a random block in the formation will change to a white block after it is placed. Block: Similar to Normal mode, but blocks will not fall out of formation until a match is made, allowing for impressive clear combos. These modes can be played either single player or two-player simultaneous on separate fields. There is also a versus mode for one or two players, in which creating a combo of three or more clears will attack the opposing player, which causes them to lose control of their pieces for a short time.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.06", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Sonic_the_Hedgehog_video_games#Other_spin-o", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/MgHo2FApgMI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/33536\n"}
