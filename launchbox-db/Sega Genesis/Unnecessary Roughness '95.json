{"altername_name": [], "name": "Unnecessary Roughness '95", "overview": "This Game's So Intense, Everything Else Is Unnecessary. On any given Sunday, it comes down to one thing: You against the other guy, strength against strength. It's power football and you don't go half way. You'll pound the middle with backs like Barry Foster and Jerome Bettis. Stuff the run with guys like Reggie White and Junior Seau. Take Sterling Sharpe and Rod Woodson one-on-one with Tim Brown. You'll spread 'em out with multiple offensive and defensive sets, shut 'em down with all-out blitzes and custom audible calls. In this game, you'll play through blind-side sacks, goal line leaps and hits so intense, you'll wonder if it's worth the punishment. But any pro will tell you, the only thing that's unnecessary is losing.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "November 1, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Accolade", "publishers": "Accolade", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.06", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unnecessary_Roughness_'95", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqqlzMoX7LI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4455\n"}
