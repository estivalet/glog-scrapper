After you choose your fighter for his parameters (strength, stamina and resistance), you can choose from 55 different moves. You can now train your fighter at a gym before the real fights. To master the game, one must alternate training and fights, as training improves stamina, strength and resistance. Be careful, loosing a fight reduces those parameters, so you have to be ready before getting on the ring !", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "January 29, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Loriciels", "publishers": "Electro Brain", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.17", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_of_the_Best:_Championship_Karate", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlPnHuwjzp4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4058\n"}
