{"altername_name": [], "name": "Frog Dude", "overview": "A platformer for the Sega Mega Drive developed by Twilight sometime in the mid-1990s. It was never released. Andy Swann, a programmer at the firm released a prototype version of the game online in 2014. The ROM was originally demonstrated at ECTS 1993. Very little progress is thought to have been made on Frog Dude. Though the prototype is fully playable, it consists of a small stage littered with apples but devoid of enemies or obstacles. The player can switch between \"human\" and \"frog\" form with A. B presumably attacks (although there is nothing to attack) and C jumps. While in frog form the player can jump higher at the expense of speed. B can also be held, Super Mario Bros.-style to make the character run, although the speed increase is fairly minimal. It is impossible to win or lose. The player is not affected by what is assumed to be bottomless pits, nor is there any way to complete the level. There is also no sound.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Twilight", "publishers": "", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/80398\n"}
