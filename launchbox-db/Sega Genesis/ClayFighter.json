This allows for interesting moves and stylized graphics. The zany roster includes: Bad Mr. Frosty, a snowman; Taffy, a piece of stretchable candy; Blob, a character who can morph into different shapes; Blue Suede Goo, an Elvis knock-off; Ickybod Clay, a pumpkin-headed ghost; Helga, an opera singer; and Bonker, the crazed clown. Each character also has their own level and individual taunts.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "June 23, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ringler Studios", "publishers": "Interplay", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.87", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ClayFighter_(video_game)", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC4YCXJjVuI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1663\n"}
