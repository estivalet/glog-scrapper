{"altername_name": ["Risky Woods", "Jashin Draxos", "Risky Woods"], "name": "Risky Woods", "overview": "The ancient monks, who preserve the wisdom of the Lost Lands, have been frozen in stone. Young Rohan must plunge into the Risky Woods to release them. Only then can wisdom triumph once again. Unusually for Electronic Arts in the early 90s, this was a platform -shooter game with little or no adventuring or strategy elements. The game scrolls sideways, and has sections where precision jumps are required, either to clear rivers or collect bonuses. You carry a dagger to deal with the enemies, and must avoid contact with them. When killed, they leave coins to be collected - these are spent in the shop sections. Death loses you most of your coins, but they can usually be retrieved if they land on solid ground - making it better to be killed in combat than by drowning.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "December 14, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dinamic Software", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.92", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/28239\n"}
