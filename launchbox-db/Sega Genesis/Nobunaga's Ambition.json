Gameplay is similar to Koei's better known Romance of the Three Kingdoms game. Players begin by selecting either a 17 regions scenario or a larger 50 scenario. Then, the player must select a daimyo, each of which is rated attributes in several categories; Age, Health, Ambition, Luck, Charm and IQ. As the game progresses, these values change depending on events in the game. The age value represents a time limit of sorts, as an elderly daimyo becomes increasingly likely to die of old age or sickness.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "September 15, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Koei", "publishers": "Koei", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "8", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobunaga's_Ambition_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwSuXFSAE1I", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4297\n"}
