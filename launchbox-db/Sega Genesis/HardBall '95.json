{"altername_name": [], "name": "HardBall '95", "overview": "HardBall '95 is the most realistic baseball game ever. This year, we included new player animations and realistic player cards. We made it more strategic. Trade Maddux straight across for McDowell. Follow the chase for the batting title with Gwynn or Bonds, and, to top it all off, we even made it more challenging with a stronger computer opponent. Watch Dykstra and Gonzalez make gold-glove stops or see pitchers try to pick off Molitor and Lofton leaning from 1st. The bottom line is that HardBall '95 is as close to the real thing as you'll get. So step up, dig in and think fastball because it's a whole new ballgame. And this one's for the pennant.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "June 1, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "MindSpan", "publishers": "Accolade", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.58", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4211\n"}
