They have somehow gained control of the satellite communication network, and are now holding the entire planet hostage under threat of using nuclear bombs to destroy the world's great cities. The superpowers of East and West are paralyzed, and the helpless citizens of Earth hold their breath as the doomsday clock ticks away! A ransom demand has been received on the computer screen at NORAD, the USA's defense command center: \"If all governments do not surrender to us within ten days, we will destroy the entire world with nuclear missiles, and all that will remain of your great cities will be piles of ash!\" The President makes the decision to call in the Special Forces air unit, code-named \"Vapor Trail\". Somewhere in the Pacific Ocean, alert-sirens wail away inside of a secret Special Forces aircraft carrier. Operation VAPOR TRAIL has been initiated...and you are the world's last hope for freedom!", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "August 2, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Data East", "publishers": "Renovation Products, Inc.", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.54", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vapor_Trail:_Hyper_Offence_Formation#Mega_Drive/Genesis_release", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUZTQPszCwM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4458\n"}
