{"altername_name": ["Slime World", "Todd's Adventures in Slime World"], "name": "Todd's Adventures in Slime World", "overview": "Todd and Rooney are mild-mannered go-getters who believe it is easier and more rewarding to drive a space cruiser than to navigate a desk in some window-less office. One dreary day, Todd gets stuck in his cubicle for several hours because the space exploration business has become a pastime for newly-weds. Not many assignments adorn the dashboard of Todd's wooden, four-legged carpet cruiser until Rooney comes bumbling toward Todd's cubicle. It seems a new planet has been discovered near Beta Delta and the administration feels it is a big project to explore. Todd and Rooney are perfect for the job! The mission briefing says the planet is a blue-green giant made of some unknown semi-liquid material, but the two gung-ho guinea pigs are out the door before they can read on: The blue-green-but-mostly-green Slime Planet's many winding tunnels and slime meanies await the next victims! - Keep Todd or Rooney slime-free in the tunnels, make the right decisions and find the way out before exposure to the green goop gives them a permanent home in Slime World! - Avoid an assortment of nasties that have evolved from the slime pools or shoot them apart with your pressurized water gun in six different challenging missions! - Go head to head or let Todd and Rooney work together to solve the mysteries of the Slime World in the two-player mode!", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "April 30, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Epyx", "publishers": "Renovation Products, Inc.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "2.79", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd%27s_Adventures_in_Slime_World", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/19915\n"}
