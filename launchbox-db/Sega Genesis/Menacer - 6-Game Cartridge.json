Ready, Aim, Tomatoes! - Be ToeJam and lob tomatoes at wacky enemies while Earl keeps score. Whack Ball - Grab control and win! Be the ball! Front Line - Defend your post with anti-aircraft, anti-tank and machine gun fire. Rockman's Zone - Train to be a G-Man pick out the bad guys before they pick you out.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "October 1, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Western Technologies", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiwEOJ2sRPA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4264\n"}
