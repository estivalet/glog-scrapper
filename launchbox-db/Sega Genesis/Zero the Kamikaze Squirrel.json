{"altername_name": [], "name": "Zero the Kamikaze Squirrel", "overview": "One day, Zero, the side-kick of the evil Edgar Ektor, receives a letter from his girlfriend Amy, which informs him of a lumberjack named Jacques Le Sheets chopping down trees and destroying his homeland for financial purposes. Despite Ektor's protestations, Zero decides that the desire to protect his land is more important that whatever villainous plans his boss might have had in mind. It's time to show that lumberjack that squirrels of dubious reputation are no strangers to the battle for environmental protection! Zero the Kamikaze Squirrel is a spin-off of the Aero the Acrobat games, its main protagonist being one of Aero's antagonists. The gameplay is similar to that of Aero the Acrobat games, involving fast-paced side-scrolling and platforming action. Zero can eliminate his enemies by executing his trademark Kamikaze Slam: spinning in the air and crushing the unlucky adversary. He can also collect shurikens (shooting stars) scattered across the levels, and use them for projectile attacks. The squirrel is able to perform double jumps to reach high platforms and jump over larger chasms.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "November 1, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Iguana Entertainment", "publishers": "Sunsoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.54", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_the_Kamikaze_Squirrel", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4497\n"}
