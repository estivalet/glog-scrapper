{"altername_name": ["Shikinjou", "Shikinjoh", "Shi-Kin-Joh", "Shikinj\u014d", "Forbidden City"], "name": "Forbidden City", "overview": "Shikinjoh (\"Forbidden City\") is a puzzle game similar to Sokoban in which the player must reach a goal by pushing over-sized mahjong tiles which block the path. When two matching tiles are pushed next to each other, they disappear. Other types of tiles will lock any movable tiles that come in contact with them. The Genesis/Megadrive version includes five different sound & graphics sets, dozens of puzzles to solve, and a \"special puzzle\" mode where the rules of the game are changed dramatically. There is also a puzzle construction mode where custom puzzles can be created.
