{"altername_name": ["Madden NFL '94", "NFL Pro Football '94", "Madden NFL '94", "John Madden NFL 94"], "name": "Madden NFL '94", "overview": "Madden NFL '94 features 80 teams -- 28 teams from the 1993 season, 38 Super Bowl teams from 1966-1991, 12 All Star franchise teams since 1950, and two \"All-Madden\" teams: one for the 1993 season and one from a 20-year time span. You can play these teams in a regular exhibition game or sudden death overtime game, or take the 1993 teams through an entire season. You can also enter the playoffs with the 1993 teams, the Super Bowl champions, or the All Star franchise teams. Unlike many other sports games, saving a season is done by password rather than by storing the data into a saved game.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "November 19, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "High Score Productions", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madden_NFL_%2794", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve_knQ8mNLo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/608\n"}
