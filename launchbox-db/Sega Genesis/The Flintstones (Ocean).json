{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Flintstones (Ocean)", "overview": "The Flintstones, developed by Foley Hi-Tech, and planned to be published by Ocean Software (however, this never happened), is a Sega Mega Drive game based on the 1994 live-action The Flintstones film. This game, unrelated to an identically named release by Taito, is infamous for not receiving a physical cartridge release, instead being a Sega Channel exclusive available to North American consumers for a brief period of time. Surviving prototypes are known to exist, but the full game has not been seen since 1995. A Super Nintendo version of the game was released in cartridge form in February 1995, exclusive to North America. The Mega Drive version, presumed to be largely identical, is a seven stage platform game in which players control Fred Flintstone attempting to save a captured Pebbles and Bam-Bam. In Europe, the game was set to be published by Sony Electronic Publishing in September 1994, having also appeared at their stand at ECTS Autumn 1994. In North America, it was given a tentative release date of November 1994, then December, while an Australian release was planned for May 1995. While the full game has yet to be found, an early prototype was eventually found and dumped by drx in 2019, and released on Hidden Palace on December 31st, 2019 as part of the Holiday 2019 releases. The prototype only features two playable stages and no music.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Foley Hi-Tech", "publishers": "", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://segaretro.org/The_Flintstones_(Ocean)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/146307\n"}
