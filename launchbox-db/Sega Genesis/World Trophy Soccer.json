{"altername_name": ["European Club Soccer", "J. League Champion Soccer", "World Trophy Soccer"], "name": "World Trophy Soccer", "overview": "World Trophy Soccer (also known as European Club Soccer in Europe and J. League Champion Soccer in Japan) is a reworking of Manchester United Europe, using the same side-view gameplay and a wider view than Krisalis' other football game of the time, John Barnes' European Football. All the teams who were in contention for one of the 3 main European tournaments as they were at the time of the game's release are included, although with fictitious player names and a few inaccurate kits. Cutscenes detail the match's progress, while a referee is active on the screen. The game can be played in arcade or simulation modes, with 6 different formations available.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "July 1, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Krisalis Software", "publishers": "Virgin Games", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "8", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "2.79", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Club_Soccer", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4489\n"}
