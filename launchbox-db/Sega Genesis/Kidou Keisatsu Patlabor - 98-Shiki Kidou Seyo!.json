(Launch, Type-98!) is an original scenario where the player takes the role of a new Division 2 recruit. Shortly after the player joins up, a silent military coup attacks their headquarters, and the new recruit must work together with the other Division 2 members to stop it. The game is structured as a hybrid Japanese-style RPG/adventure game. The player moves and fights in a traditional RPG style, but entering certain locations switches the game to a command-adventure style where the player can ask characters about different subjects, investigate items of interest, and collect and use a wide variety of items. At first the player controls only the recruit, but other characters later join the player's party.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "October 23, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "MA-BA", "publishers": "MA-BA", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.44", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/19715\n"}
