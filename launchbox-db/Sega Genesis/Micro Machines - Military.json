{"altername_name": [], "name": "Micro Machines: Military", "overview": "This entry in the Micro Machines series flirts with a military theme. Using a top-down view, you race on different scaled-down tracks such as a pond, a kitchen table, a workbench, in the garden... The theme is reflected in the vehicles (helicopters, speedboats, tanks, supply trucks...), as well as in the music. There are different game types, such as regular races (challenges), time trials, and battle arenas, in which you have to survive for a set amount of time while enemy vehicles charge. Other players can be shot to slow them down.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "November 15, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Supersonic Software", "publishers": "Codemasters", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.88", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Machines_(video_game_series)#Micro_Machines_Military_(1996)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MD2fZeb9bqg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/18900\n"}
