Battle hordes of crazed barbarians, mow down mobs of poisonous centipedes, and slay squadrons of winged gargoyels. Blast enemies in waves or one by one with multi-directional, auto-targeting laser fire. Recruit killer companions like the DragonFrye, Ball O'Fire, Thunder Raven and Boomerang Lizard. Use them to hurl blistering boomerangs, fireballs, and electrical attacks. With Alisia's super-tough fighting skills, fry enemies to a crisp. And prove once and for all that you can go hand-to-hand with evil and come out the champion!", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "February 1, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Game Arts", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.96", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alisia_Dragoon", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/ZIIRtWPYBtg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4017\n"}
