{"altername_name": ["Shi Zi Wang 2", "Sh\u012bziw\u00e1ng II", "The Lion King 2", "The Lion King II"], "name": "The Lion King 2", "overview": "The Lion King II is an unlicensed platformer for the Sega Mega Drive. It is based on the 1994 film The Lion King (as opposed to its 1998 sequel which shares the Lion King II title). It was developed by Gamtec at an unknown date, and uses sound effects from other unlicensed Mega Drive games. For example, the sound for Simba slashing enemies is the select sound from Rockman X3, and the sound when picking up an item is from Squirrel King. A sequel, Lion King 3, was developed later on, and is also based on the first movie. There are two playable characters: Simba and Mufasa, the latter can be played by collecting a golden star. Simba can be reaccessed when touching an enemy, and torches act as checkpoints; the player's lion can activate them by jumping up when next to a torch. Trivia Reprints of the original cartridge contain an unintentional bug, possibly due to faulty patching to copy protection found in the original game. The bug causes both invincibility and unlimited lives. Although the life meter does not decrease, the player will still transform from lion to cub if attacked by an enemy. Rather controversially, a swastika (or more specifically, a Manji, which the Swastika was based off) appears on one of the machines in one of the stages.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gamtec", "publishers": "X Boy", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.68", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyCz6Cizboo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/91320\n"}
