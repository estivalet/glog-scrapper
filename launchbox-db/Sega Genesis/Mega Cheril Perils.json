{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mega Cheril Perils", "overview": "Mega Cheril Perils is a 2D platform game based on the 2010 ZX Spectrum title Cheril Perils. It keeps some elements of the original game as well as the premise, but both visually and for the gameplay there are many differences. The game stars the character Cheril. Wearing no clothes she leaves her homeland, the jungle of Badajoz, to start a life in the city. When she arrives there she discovers the city is overrun by zombies. A virus created by the pharmaceutic enterprise Parasol meant to make everyone beautiful was transported in a cistern truck not properly cleaned. The previous content was morapio double-malt and the mix of the two substances has an unusual side effect: it turns people into brain-eating zombies. Now the city has been shut down by the mayor using a barrier. The only way for Cheril to leave the city is by killing all zombies to clean the streets and convince the mayor the city is safe again.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "February 3, 2017", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "The Mojon Twins", "publishers": "The Mojon Twins", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/138079\n"}
