This game is based on the animated series that aired around this time. Spider-Man's past comes back to haunt him when more maniacal madmen, than you can count on two webbed hands, bust out of prison and team up to settle the score against him. Only your Spider-Sense, wall-climbing ability, web swinging maneuvers and a little help from the Fantastic Four can even the odds! The hunt is on... but who's the prey?", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Marvel Software", "publishers": "Acclaim Entertainment", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man_(1995_video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVl2njg2Oeo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2485\n"}
