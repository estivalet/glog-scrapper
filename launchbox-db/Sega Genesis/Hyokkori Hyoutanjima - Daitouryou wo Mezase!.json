(\"Aim for the Presidency!\") is a sugoroku-style board game for up to four players based on the popular NHK children's show Hyokkori Hy\u014dtanjima. Four characters from the show all decide they want to be the island's president, and so they set off to start campaigning. The goal of each round is to collect the most points; points can be earned or lost based on the spaces the player lands on. The round ends when a player reaches the destination set at the start of the round, which gives a points bonus. The player with the most points after a set number of rounds is the winner.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "August 7, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/19835\n"}
