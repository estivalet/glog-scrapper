Whether you choose Easy, Normal, Hard or Crazy speeds, Ms. Pac-Man will have you running ragged! There's even a Pac Booster button to really let her shake those pesky ghosts. Play Ms. Pac-Man by yourself or take turns with a friend. Better yet, two can play at the same time - one as the divine Ms. Pac-Man; the other, as the original Pac-Man!", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "July 1, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Innerprise Software", "publishers": "Tengen", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.14", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ms._Pac-Man", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_bAWM4hAro", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1856\n"}
