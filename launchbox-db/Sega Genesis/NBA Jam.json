Each human player controls a single player, so choose your squad wisely to take team-mate skill into account. The game is action-oriented, and players can perform unrealistic slam-dunks. Full performance statistics are automatically recorded. The play clock and 3-point line apply, but other rules are largely overlooked.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "March 4, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Iguana Entertainment", "publishers": "Arena Entertainment", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.15", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Jam_(1993_video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obtIUtAOpt0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/634\n"}
