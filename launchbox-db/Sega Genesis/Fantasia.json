Bounce on poisonous mushrooms to knock their tops off. Leap over pits of ooze in an ancient jungle where dinosaurs rumble. Everywhere you go, grab spell books, crystal balls, and dinosaur eggs for more magic powers! Explore world after world! Dive into dangerous seas filled with snapping creatures. Zoom high into space and dodge speeding stars! On Bald Mountain, witches and wailing goblins chase you through fiery lava. Can Mickey escape with the notes, so the music can play again? It's up to you!", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "August 1, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Infogrames Europe SA", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.05", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasia_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObFhr7oGc6w", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/29434\n"}
