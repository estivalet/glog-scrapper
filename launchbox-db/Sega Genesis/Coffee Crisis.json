{"altername_name": [], "name": "Coffee Crisis", "overview": "Coffee Crisis is a neo-rogue brawler that puts you in the shoes of the only baristas on Earth with enough heavy metal in their veins to fend off an alien assault. Play solo or join up with a friend to fight across eight unique locations ranging from your Coffee House HQ to the far reaches of outer space. Go up against an army of wild alien enemies, and the humans they have brainwashed with a variety of weapons, special moves, suplexes, and coffee! The Smurglian race has come to Earth and they're not leaving until they steal our three most prized commodities: heavy metal, free Wifi, and our coffee. Crunch through fistfuls of alien meat as you stop their invasion, and enjoy random modifiers to the enemies and action on each playthrough. It's a totally unique cup of beat 'em up action every time you play!", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "February 24, 2017", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mega Cat Studios", "publishers": "Mega Cat Studios", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.58", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_Crisis", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DDTNXIt1aM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/122379\n"}
