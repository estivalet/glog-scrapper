{"altername_name": ["Harry Potter und der Stein der Weisen"], "name": "Harry Potter", "overview": "Harry Potter und der Stein der Weisen (\"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\" in German) is an unlicensed game for the Mega Drive made after the movie Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was released. The game plays somewhat like a 3D Pac-Man clone, with a total of three isometric levels to play through. The levels take place in Hogwarts, the Forbidden Forest and an Arabian area resembling Agrabah more than any setting in Harry Potter. The player controls Harry Potter, who has to collect dots which move around the map while avoiding any enemies. The player can teleport if they walk off the edge of the map to another edge of it, which is decided at random. After beating the third level the player is sent back to the title screen, and it is unknown whether or not this is intended.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "2001", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "KuKzz", "publishers": "", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVpgSLLNtW0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/127863\n"}
