{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Simpsons: Bart vs. the Space Mutants", "overview": "Hello, fellow humans! Bartholomew J. Simpson here, with a very important secret: SPACE MUTANTS ARE INVADING SPRINGFIELD! That's right, man! A buncha slimy, horrible totally gross and putrid monsters are taking over the bodies of the people who live here and they wanna build a weapon that's gonna take over the entire planet! Pretty cool, huh? Anyway, yours truly is the only one who can see 'em 'cause of my X-Ray glasses - so it's up to me to stop 'em! I've gotta spraypaint things, get radical on my skateboard, use my trusty slingshot and in general, behave like a nuisance, man. Plus, with evil dudes like Nelson the bully and Sideshow Bob getting in my way, it's a good thing I've got the rest of the Simpsons to help me out! So if you're a decent person, a patriot and somebody who cares about this sorry planet, you'll do the right thing. Save the Earth! BUY THIS GAME!
