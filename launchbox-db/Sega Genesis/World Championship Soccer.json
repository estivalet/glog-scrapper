To win, you'll move swiftly through qualifying rounds onto the Final Tournament where only the best are lined up for intense competition. Maybe you'll meet the teams of France, Italy or England who play with the unusual bravado. Long on strategy, they prove worthy contenders against the fiery speed of their Latin counterparts from Mexico, Brazil and Argentina. But nothing beats the determination of China and Japan whose team credo remains, \"Never say die!\". And these are just some of the twenty-four teams, our ol' red, white and blue included, who are ready to kick, dribble and shoot their way to victory. So how will you play? Tough offense, strong defense? Only one can win. So lace up your cleats and let's see some smoke on that field.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "July 29, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sega", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.67", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Championship_Soccer", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eX5cE0-fio", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4482\n"}
