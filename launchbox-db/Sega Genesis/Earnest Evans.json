{"altername_name": [], "name": "Earnest Evans", "overview": "The story of the game is connected to that of El Viento. Earnest Evans is a brave treasure hunter. His grandfather was a famous archaeologist who searched for three legendary idols in the 1930s. It was said that those idols could bring disaster upon the Earth if fallen into the wrong hands. But despite his efforts, he could never find even one of the idols. Now it's up to the grandson to continue his work, fifty years later. But the evil syndicate leader Brady Tressider has his own plans, and will do anything to stop Earnest... This is an action platform game in which you control Earnest Evans, armed with his trusty whip. The hero can jump, climb ropes, crouch, and crawl. There are plenty of obstacles on the levels (bottomless pits, spikes, crushing bridges, lava, etc.), as well as gangsters and monsters to dispose of.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Wolf Team", "publishers": "Renovation Products, Inc.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.42", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnest_Evans", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOXnW3UsSeo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4121\n"}
