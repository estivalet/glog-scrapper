{"altername_name": ["Pokemon Stadium"], "name": "Pok\u00e9mon Stadium", "overview": "Pok\u00e9mon Stadium is an unlicensed game loosely based on the Nintendo 64 game of the same name, made for the Sega Genesis & SNES by an unknown developer. The Sega Genesis version of Pok\u00e9mon Stadium, while having some aesthetic improvements and access to Pok\u00e9mon unavailable in the SNES version, seems to be more broken than its SNES counterpart. The Arcade mode seems to not work properly, since after the first fight (Which will always be against Dogas) the game goes back to the title screen. Taunting seems to be taken out, and whenever one Pok\u00e9mon attacks, both Pok\u00e9mon's' meters will be gone the next turn. Also, defending and evading seem to be swapped.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "SKOB", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106868\n"}
