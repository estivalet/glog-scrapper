{"altername_name": ["Super Mario Bros. 2", "Super Mario 2"], "name": "Super Mario Bros. 2", "overview": "Super Mario Bros. 2 is a pirated port of Super Mario Bros. for the Mega Drive, made by an unknown company in 1998. Despite the name, this is actually a port of the first Super Mario Bros. and is based off the SNES port. The engine is remade, and as a result the game is much more difficult to control. The bosses at the end of each world can now be jumped on like a standard enemy. When Bowser is defeated for the last time, Peach can finally be saved although her sprites seem to be glitching in a indescribable manner. As you save the Princess, the text \"THANK YOU SONIC THE KINGDOM IS SAVED NOW TRY AGAIN\" is displayed. This may imply that this game is a hacked version of another bootleg game for the Sega Mega Drive, known as Sonic Jam 6.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "1998", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gamtec", "publishers": "", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.21", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106903\n"}
