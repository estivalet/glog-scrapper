Use light-speed reflexes and total concentration to fly your prototype fighter through impossible caverns rescuing miners and blast those aliens into the darkest pits of space! The game consists of 10 missions. Each mission takes place in a vast cavern, with interesting weather conditions. You must explore it and complete the mission objectives -- usually collecting sub parts, rescuing trapped miners, or destroying giant, epic bosses. You can also explore the levels, but keep an eye on your fuel gauge and beware the many hazards!", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "March 1, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Zyrinx", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.07", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-Terrania", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2450\n"}
