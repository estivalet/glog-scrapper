While at first not knowing the difference between a slam dunk and a Sherman tank, he slowly becomes an important part of the Shohoku High School team, which fights against the odds on the road towards the regional championships. Slam Dunk: Ky\u014dg\u014d Makk\u014d Taiketsu! (Champion Front Showdown!) is a five-on-five basketball game based on the anime and manga created by Takehiko Inoue. Following the story, starting from the first exhibition matches, the player can take control of either a single player or the whole Shohoku team in an arcade-style basketball game. The game uses a side-view for the center court, and zooms in for a head-on view when near the basket. There is also an exhibition mode for up to five players, where six different school teams from the series are available for play.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "April 28, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "SIMS", "publishers": "Bandai", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "5", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "4.39", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/19709\n"}
