While each country got the same game ROM, each country got slightly different packaging featuring players from that country's national soccer team. It is supposedly the last officially-licensed Mega Drive game released in Europe (but this is unconfirmed), and was released exclusively in this region. As with its predecessor, the Mega Drive version is an isometric game which lacks the 3D technology seen in other ports.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Extended Play Productions", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA:_Road_to_World_Cup_98", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/33720\n"}
