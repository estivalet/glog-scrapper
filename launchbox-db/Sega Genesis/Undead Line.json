{"altername_name": [], "name": "Undead Line", "overview": "Undead Line is a top-down arcade shooter with scrolling screens, like Commando and other games. The player controls a character that shoots projectiles at enemy monsters. The six levels available are presented in a menu and can be selected and played in any order. There is a boss battle at the end of each one. Chests with power-ups are scattered throughout the levels. They open when shot, and in the Genesis version it is possible to cycle through the available power-ups by keeping firing at them. The power-ups include armor and speed boosts, and several types of projectiles.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "December 20, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "PALSOFT", "publishers": "Palsoft", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.62", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CU0yBcpQQPo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/14277\n"}
