{"altername_name": ["Spider-Man vs The Kingpin"], "name": "Spider-Man (Sega)", "overview": "America's Superhero, the amazing Spider-Man, is in serious trouble. The Kingpin has vowed to destroy New York and he's assembled a vast army of villains to help, including Dr. Octopus, The Hobgoblin, Venom, Electro, The Lizard, and The Sandman! But Spider-Man boasts the proportional powers of a super spider! He swings on a web line across dizzying chasms no other superhero could handle! He punches and kicks with spectacular strength, clambers up buildings and crawls across girders--even upside down. And uses his webbing to trap enemies and spin protective shields. Each villain has his own evil bag of tricks. Mutant reptiles in the sewer--electric bats among the high-power lines--alien entities on skyscraper roofs--all these and much more face the high-flying web-slinger as he races to save the city!", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "August 1, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Technopop", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man_vs._The_Kingpin", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLuPgyv_3Yk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/588\n"}
