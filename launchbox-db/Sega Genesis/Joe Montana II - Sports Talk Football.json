Control the action on the field and listen to the running commentary from the broadcast booth. It's a whole new game of sound and sight! The field zooms to a dazzling 6X close-up when the players cross the scrimmage line. You see every slamming interception, flying tackle and smash through the defensive wall! Up close and personal! Team up with another guy - you're the quarterback, he's the wide receiver. Call your strategy with over 50 plays in rain/snow, on grass/artificial field. Wide view shows all your receivers at once.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "November 1, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "BlueSky Software", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/511\n"}
