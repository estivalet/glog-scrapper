Each race consists of four laps around tracks viewed from an isometric perspective, which enables players to discern the presence of frequent sloping sections spread throughout the game's various tracks. In addition to navigating the turns, racers must also maneuver hills and dips without falling or jumping over the guard rail at the track's edge.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "November 1, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Blizzard Entertainment", "publishers": "Interplay", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.34", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4361\n"}
