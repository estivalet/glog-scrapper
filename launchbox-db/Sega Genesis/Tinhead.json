The direction is chosen by using a specific button.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "MicroProse", "publishers": "Ballistic", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.36", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4436\n"}
