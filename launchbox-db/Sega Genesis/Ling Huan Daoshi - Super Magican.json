Its name is disputable - while the title screen and packaging use chinese lettering, it is subtitled with an English name of Super Magician. Furthermore the ROM header lists the game's name as Elf Wor, and it has also been referred to as Reigen Doushi and Revenge of Fu Manchu. The game is strikingly similar to Zombies Ate My Neighbors, though has a more eastern setting.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Gamtec", "publishers": "Ming Super Chip", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVndkh4y8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/19747\n"}
