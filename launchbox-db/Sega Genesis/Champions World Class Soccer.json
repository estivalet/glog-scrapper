{"altername_name": [], "name": "Champions World Class Soccer", "overview": "This soccer game offers 32 national teams to play, with none of the players' names shown. Shown from a slightly tilted 3rd-person side perspective, players can do an exhibition match, full tournament or go against a human player in the 2-player exhibition mode. The different teams are ranked by speed, offense and defence, and different team formations can be selected. The gameplay is very basic: players can pass, shoot, tackle with a third button used to switch between players. In the options menu, fouls and offside can be disabled, the amount of time per half can be determined and there is a radar and mini-map to track the other players. The European edition is endorsed by Ryan Giggs and the game uses a password system to continue tournaments", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "May 13, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Park Place Productions", "publishers": "Flying Edge", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.62", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champions_World_Class_Soccer", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJOUaVsWUlo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4076\n"}
