{"altername_name": ["Sonic The Hedgehog Mega Mix", "Sonic MegaMix", "Sonic 1 MegaMix"], "name": "Sonic The Hedgehog MegaMix", "overview": "This ROM hack (v3.0) for the Sega Genesis / Mega Drive is considered a \u201ccomplete\u201d release, although not \u201cfinal\u201d. A successor ROM hack was later ported to the Sega CD / Mega-CD (v4.0b), but the ported hack is in an \"incomplete\" or \"unstable\" state. The genesis ROM hack features bug fixes, all new level layouts, unique character moves & attacks, level intros & elemental shields ala Sonic 3 & Knuckles, loads of music edits, unique character ending sequence poses, super forms, game customization via a \"preferences\" menu, new cheat codes, and a special unlockable level select. 15 years have passed since Sonic the Hedgehog's first plight against the nefarious Dr. Eggman (originally known as Dr. Ivo Robotnik in English localisations). Some say history repeats itself. In the hopes of obtaining the land's powerful Chaos Emeralds and finally make a solid step in conquering the planet, Eggman returns to South Island, a magnificent land not bound by restrictions such as time. Hearing of Eggman's latest plans, Sonic travels to South Island, along with two allies: Mighty the Armadillo and Shadow the Hedgehog. The three split up, each taking their own unique abilities with them, to search for the remaining Chaos Emeralds, and to defeat Eggman and make him abandon his plans of world domination.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "August 13, 2008", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sonic Team", "publishers": "Team Megamix", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.23", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78622\n"}
