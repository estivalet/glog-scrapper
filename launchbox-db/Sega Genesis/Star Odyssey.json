Humans settled down on different planets, sometimes coming into contact with other races, and established a connection between them. The player is a nameless young man who was a mere child when he survived a spaceship crash and had to seek shelter on a new planet. Now he is sixteen, and his parents send him as a foreign student to the planet Terra. That is where his adventure begins! Star Odyssey (originally released as Blue Almanac) is a sci-fi themed Japanese-style role-playing game. The player's party encounters random enemies and fights them in turn-based combat. The combat is viewed from a side-scrolling perspective and both the player's and enemies' attacks are animated.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "June 22, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hot-B", "publishers": "Kodansha Research Institute", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.03", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIor4h172yE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/24447\n"}
