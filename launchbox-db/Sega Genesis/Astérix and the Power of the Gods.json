{"altername_name": ["Ast\u00e9rix and the Power of the Gods", "Asterix and the Power of the Gods"], "name": "Ast\u00e9rix and the Power of the Gods", "overview": "In Gaul (where modern-day France would be today), the leader of the Gauls - Vercingetorix - was defeated by Julius Caesar and his Roman army. The shield was lost to the invading Romans and Asterix must liberate the shield from their control. Players must guide Asterix through different levels in this 2D platforming game. An isometric map is used to enter different levels. Asterix has the ability to run, jump, and defeat enemies by directly hitting them. Players can talk to non-player characters just like in a role-playing game. Other people's houses can also be visited in search of clues.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "April 1, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Core Design", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.39", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterix_and_the_Power_of_the_Gods", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WowqaANEZLo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/9366\n"}
