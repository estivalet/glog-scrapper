{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sacred Line Genesis", "overview": "Sacred Line: Genesis is a homebrew visual novel about the private detective Ellen who operates in Eastern Europe. She inherited the business from her missing sister Sarah, but when she is about to close it she receives an anonymous call tasking her to locate a hidden forest outpost. The entire story is told through still images with 3D graphics. There are horror elements to the game and most of the interaction is based on a number of choices using a menu structure. These choices can lead to many different endings such as a normal one, a secret one and several that end with death. There is also a text-based dice fighting system and the developer encourages to play it with a real dice. When dead the game restarts from the last checkpoint. It includes an in-game encyclopedia to learn more about the characters. There is a PCM based soundtrack that sounds like the output of a Game Boy Advance title.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "October 24, 2013", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sasha Darko", "publishers": "WaterMelon", "genres": "Visual Novel", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/98460\n"}
