{"altername_name": [], "name": "Greendog: The Beached Surfer Dude!", "overview": "Greendog rips into an excellent adventure. First he's pounded by a massive wave. Then he's snaked by an Aztec curse. His surfboard's gone and a weird pendant is stuck around his neck. He's beached... and bewitched! Break Greendog's curse! Thrash on a skate-board. Rip on in-line skates. Pilot Greendog's personal pedal-copter over foe-infested seas. Search for treasures through 12 levels of dripping wet Caribbean graphics to a massive reggae beat! Greendog's curse makes every animal on earth--including tourist!--go berserk-o. Toss a killer disc to bash the squirrely enemies. Scarf energizing fries, hot dogs and sodas. Find a bone for Fetch, Greendog's little mutt, and he'll cool out and help you. It's a totally outrageous mission. In a crazy island paradise of loony crabs, poisonous piranhas and a mutoid skeleton pirate. So crank up the tunes. And start shreddin'!", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "September 1, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Interactive Designs", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.96", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2459\n"}
