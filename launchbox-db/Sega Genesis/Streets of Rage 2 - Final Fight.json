{"altername_name": ["Streets of Rage 2: Final Fight Crossover"], "name": "Streets of Rage 2: Final Fight", "overview": "It is a pity that the heroes of the Metro City never fought as one team again since the first Final Fight game, but at least they can fight as one team in this hack of Streets of Rage 2. Imagine if there are multiple timelines, and there is one that the heroes of Capcom will fight the villains of Sega, it will be another exciting story. In this hacked game, the four playable characters are Mayor Mike Haggar, Cody, Guy, and Chun-Li. Each of the four playable characters requires a unique fighting strategy, so that you will not get bored. On the other hand, Mr. X will have Akuma/Gouki as his bodyguard. Watch out for his Raging Demon!
