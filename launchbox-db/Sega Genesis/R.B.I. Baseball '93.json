{"altername_name": [], "name": "R.B.I. Baseball '93", "overview": "Continuing the R.B.I. series, the 1993 entry updates the rosters, adding two new teams (Colorado and Florida), bringing the total to 28 teams, and nearly 700 players. Instead of a generic stadium, all 28 teams have their own ballparks modeled after the real deal. On top of the regular team vs team mode, (in either a single game, best of 7, you vs the division, or you vs the entire league) you can spend time in a home run derby or fielding practice. Also includes rosters of every division champ from 1984 onwards for Game Breaker mode. Play is either player vs computer, as either the home or visiting team, two players, or computer vs computer. Password saves allowing resuming the multi-game modes. Included is the ability to edit the teams; you can transfer players between teams to keep the rosters current, or just have some fun. Finally, the Game Breaker mode allows setting up a game in progress using any team, any inning, any score.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "June 1, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tengen", "publishers": "Tengen", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.7", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dflzDibv9-I", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4351\n"}
