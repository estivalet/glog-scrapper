Once you complete them, you'll unlock the final stage. The bears can jump, throw rocks at enemies, or swing a net to hit them. In each area there are a lot of things to gather - mostly food. After a level is completed, you'll be shown how much valuable stuff you have managed to get.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "November 1, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Realtime Associates", "publishers": "Sega", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.07", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chrsS5EL2l8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4416\n"}
