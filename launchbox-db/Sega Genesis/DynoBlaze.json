{"altername_name": [], "name": "DynoBlaze", "overview": "DynoBlaze is an unreleased beat-'em-up game for the Sega Mega Drive by Bonsai Entertainment and Virgin Interactive Entertainment. It is notable for using Virgin's \"Digicel\" technology, originally built for Disney's Aladdin. The game was also referred to by some publications as Dinoblades. DynoBlaze was cancelled for unknown reasons, but an extremely early prototype (dated January 1994) has since been dumped. Very little exists within this prototype, and the music is borrowed from RoboCop Versus The Terminator. A Sega Mega-CD version was also announced, but even less is known about that version. The game re-emerged as DinoBlaze: What's the Rumpus at CES 1995, this as a planned 3DO release, but it too was cancelled.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bonsai Entertainment", "publishers": "", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.62", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106788\n"}
