{"altername_name": [], "name": "Road Rash", "overview": "Road Rash is an aggressive motorcycle racing game where the player assumes the role of a biker who takes part in a series of illegal races across the U.S.A. Starting at the back of the pack the objective is always to finish first on a linear course, overtaking the other bikers. This is achieved by driving very well or by playing it dirty, knocking opponents of their bikes using clubs, crowbars or your bare hands. The other racers fight back in a similar fashion and there are also hazards. All the races take place on the regular road with normal traffic (in both directions) and the cops, as well as occasional oil slicks and stray cows.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "September 1, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Electronic Arts", "publishers": "Electronic Arts", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.13", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_Rash_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdhrDE5L7ds", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4358\n"}
