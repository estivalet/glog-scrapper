{"altername_name": ["Maou Renjishi", "Ma\u014d Renjishi", "Mystical Fighter"], "name": "Mystical Fighter", "overview": "You're standing at The Gate of Time. Step through and you'll find yourself transported back in time to the Shogun Dynasty. Here you will take up the cause of the Mystical Fighters in a destination known as The Underworld, in their struggle to defeat the Evil Lord Kabuki and save their kingdom. If you're up to the challenge, use your magic and martial arts powers to kick, punch, spin and throw Kabki's henchmen all over the screen. And if the action of The Underworld streets is too much, double your odds and ask a friend to join you in two-players simultaneous action. But hurry. The key to breaking the Sacred Seal of Kentari separates you from the ultimate showdown with the Evil Lord Kabuki.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "October 25, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "KID Corp.", "publishers": "DreamWorks", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.44", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystical_Fighter_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qtxSG5XUg0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4277\n"}
