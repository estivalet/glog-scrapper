{"altername_name": ["Sansan", "San San"], "name": "Sansan", "overview": "Sansan (\u30b5\u30f3\u30b5\u30f3) is an online service allowing people living in Japan to play the abstract strategy board game Go with other subscribers over the internet on a Windows PC. However, at its launch in 1994, a version for the Sega Mega Drive was also made available. This version of the game allows players who have a Sega Mega Modem to connect over a 33.3kbps or ISDN line to play other members who have a Sansan ID. However, as of 2011, there are no known Mega Drive-compatible Sansan servers. A local two-player version of the game is also included for play. For whatever reason, the Mega Drive version did not last very long \u2014 it is one of the rarest and most sought-after Mega Drive games; Sega of Japan's official archive doesn't list it (despite Sansan Co., Ltd. having T-series code T-147) and a ROM was not dumped until February 2011. The Windows PC version of the service continues to this day.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "September 1, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "White Box", "publishers": "Sansan", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnjPpjmRxbk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/19805\n"}
