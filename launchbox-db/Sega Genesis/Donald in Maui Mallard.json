{"altername_name": ["Donald duck in Maui Mallard"], "name": "Donald in Maui Mallard", "overview": "Disney's Donald Duck takes the starring role in this sidescrolling platform game. As the detective Maui Mallard, he's on the trail of a long lost Idol, which has recently vanished. Early on, Maui can also switch between his normal self and Ninja Maui, and with all the creepy voodoo enemies he'll encounter throughout his adventure, he's going to need all the help he can get. As previously mentioned, there are two personalities to Maui, and as a result, two different sets of controls. Normal Maui carries a bug gun, which can fire a variety of different insect ammo, from basic bugs, to the more powerful lightning and fire bugs. It's also possible for Maui to combine bugs to pack a more powerful blast at his enemies.", "platform": "Sega Genesis", "release_date": "December 8, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Disney Interactive", "publishers": "Disney Interactive", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.6", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/10342\n"}
