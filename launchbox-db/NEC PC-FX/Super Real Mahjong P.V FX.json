{"altername_name": [], "name": "Super Real Mahjong P.V FX", "overview": "Super Real Mahjong PV is the fifth installment in the strip mahjong series. There is no background story in the game; the player is merely introduced to three high school girls - Mizuki, Aya, and Akira - who challenge him to the game of mahjong. The main mahjong mode is that of the one-on-one variety; after each successfully completed round the girl removes a part of her clothing. The computer versions of the game contain scenes with nudity; among the console versions, the PC-FX one is the only one that similarly lacks censorship. Some of the versions have secondary gameplay modes, such as a team mode in which the player controls three girls and plays mahjong against three others.", "platform": "NEC PC-FX", "release_date": "March 29, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "NAXAT Soft", "publishers": "SETA", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106636-super-real-mahjong-pv-fx\n"}
