{"altername_name": ["Langrisser FX, Der"], "name": "Der Langrisser FX", "overview": "Der Langrisser is an enhanced version of Langrisser II. Beside slightly improved graphical quality and a significant reduction of difficulty level, the main difference in this version is the player's ability to make moral decisions for the protagonist, which will subsequently influence the events of the narrative. In the original version, Elwin was only able to fight on the side of the Descendants of Light. In this release, Elwin also starts on this path; but as the game progresses, the player will be able to choose whether he should stay on it or side with the antagonists, the Rayguard Empire. Later, Elwin will be able to betray the Empire (in case he has chosen to help it) and support the Demon Tribe. It is also possible for Elwin to fight on neither side, and create his own fraction instead.", "platform": "NEC PC-FX", "release_date": "April 26, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Crosstalk", "publishers": "NEC Home Electronics", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.88", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langrisser_II", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75200-der-langrisser-fx\n"}
