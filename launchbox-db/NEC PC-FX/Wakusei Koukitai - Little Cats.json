{"altername_name": [], "name": "Wakusei Koukitai: Little Cats", "overview": "Little Cats is somewhat similar to Sakura Taisen games, with adventure and dating elements reduced, and simulation elements added. David has to make schedules for the girls and decide how much and what exactly they should train. Running competitions, shooting range, robot navigation - everything can be trained, but at the expense of the girls' stamina, which means they will need to rest as well. During the simulation mode, it is also possible to wander around the space station and spend time with the girls. The strategy part consists of navigating the robots over a battle field in turn-based fashion. The robots have a wide range of attacks, and it is possible to change their weapons and use items in combat. Once the robots attack each other, an automatic attack sequence is shown.", "platform": "NEC PC-FX", "release_date": "July 4, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Family Soft", "publishers": "NEC Home Electronics", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.7", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86221-wakusei-koukitai-little-cats\n"}
