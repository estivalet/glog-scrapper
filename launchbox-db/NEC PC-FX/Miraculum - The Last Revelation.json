{"altername_name": [], "name": "Miraculum: The Last Revelation", "overview": "In the world of Miraculum, there lived a powerful king named Siegwald. But his power was not enough for him, and he revived an ancient demon who had been sealed in a statue. But instead of granting him his power, the demon consumed the king's soul and possessed his body. He then swore to destroy humanity once and for all. After several years, the fake Siegwald led his armies to conquer lands and expand his empire. At that time, a warrior named Jay arrived at the port city of Heles. Now he must find loyal allies and eventually stop the Emperor's evil plans. Miraculum: The Last Revelation plays like a traditional Japanese-style RPG, with a world map, towns and dungeons to visit, and enemies to defeat in random turn-based battles. The setting is mostly medieval fantasy, but there are sci-fi elements as well. The player's party can use a variety of moves in battles, and it is also possible to set the characters on AI mode, only assigning them general strategies. Graphically the game resembles typical 16-bit Japanese RPGs, but it has some anime-style movies, CD audio music, and voice-overs for important conversations.", "platform": "NEC PC-FX", "release_date": "March 29, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Rayforce", "publishers": "NEC Home Electronics", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86202-miraculum-the-last-revelation\n"}
