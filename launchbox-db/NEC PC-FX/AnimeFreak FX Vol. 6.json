{"altername_name": [], "name": "AnimeFreak FX Vol. 6", "overview": "The final volume of Anime Freak returns, so to say, to the roots of the series: instead of slightly naughty videos of scantily clad young women (real or drawn in anime style), it focuses on actual game-related material. Unfortunately, by that time PC-FX was nearly extinct, so Vol. 6 contains a trailer for only one game - one last game for PC-FX: First Kiss Story. It also lacks many of the features available in other issues of Anime Freak, such as karaoke mode, news section, or walkthroughs. It concludes the mini-anime series Prism Knights and Kodomo no Omocha, started in previous two issues. New material available in this volume includes interviews with voice actors, as well as a detailed video about working in recording studios. The game in this volume is the same as in the first volume (albeit against a different actress), namely \"Rock, Paper, Scissors\".", "platform": "NEC PC-FX", "release_date": "February 27, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "NEC Home Electronics", "publishers": "NEC Home Electronics", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.56", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/127463-animefreak-fx-vol-6\n"}
