{"altername_name": [], "name": "AnimeFreak FX Vol. 2", "overview": "The second in the animefreak FX series contains: - The second episode of the anime mini-series Private Eye Doll - Another issue of \"Voice Idol\" with information about songs from PC-FX games - More photos of voice actresses - A small collection of videos featuring characters from Cutey Honey FX - A karaoke mode - PC-FX news - \"Making Of\" section - \"Pretty Girls Gallery\", with pictures of heroines of various PC-FX games - Information and videos from Blue Seed (which was never released for PC-FX) And finally, what justifies calling this compilation a game: a card-based mini-game called \"High and Low\", which is played against a real actress. The actress deals a card, and the player must guess whether the next card will be higher or lower within a time limit. Guessing correctly will give the player a star, which will be accumulated in the top left corner of the screen. Guessing wrong pushes the player back to the beginning of the game, so what really matters is winning as many times as possible", "platform": "NEC PC-FX", "release_date": "December 22, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "NEC Home Electronics", "publishers": "NEC Home Electronics", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.06", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/127459-animefreak-fx-vol-2\n"}
