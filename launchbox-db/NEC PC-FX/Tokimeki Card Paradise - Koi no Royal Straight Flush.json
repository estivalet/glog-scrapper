{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tokimeki Card Paradise: Koi no Royal Straight Flush", "overview": "Tokimeki Card Paradise includes four card games: Poker, Blackjack, Speed, and the Japanese card game Papanuki. Each of those games can be played against one or more pretty young female opponents. The girls take their clothes off whenever they lose a turn, until they disrobe completely if they lose the whole game. In a true PC-FX fashion, every undressing move is presented as an anime-style movie.", "platform": "NEC PC-FX", "release_date": "January 26, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Sonnet Computer Entertainment", "publishers": "Sonnet Computer Entertainment", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.36", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86364-tokimeki-card-paradise-koi-no-royal-straight-flush\n"}
