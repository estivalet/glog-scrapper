{"altername_name": [], "name": "AnimeFreak FX Vol. 5", "overview": "The fifth installment of the series brings back mini-games, and this time with something far more challenging than the simple luck-based games from the first three volumes: a quiz game. The quiz is all about NEC's two consoles, PC Engine (TurboGrafx) and PC-FX, ranging from game-related to technical questions. Not only does this quiz require extensive knowledge of the consoles, but it is also timed. Other than this quiz, Vol. 5 contains most of the regular stuff seen before (Making Of, anime database, etc. - without the karaoke mode this time though). It continues the anime mini-series Prism Knights from the previous volume. It also has full walkthroughs for several PC-FX games. Vol. 5 takes a decisive step towards less kid-friendly approach: it contains a large collection of videos of various anime-style girls (from PC-FX games or otherwise) changing clothes. There is no explicit nudity, but it comes close! This volume also has videos of voice actresses in bikini on a beach and in an amusement park.", "platform": "NEC PC-FX", "release_date": "August 29, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "NEC Home Electronics", "publishers": "NEC Home Electronics", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.88", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/127462-animefreak-fx-vol-5\n"}
