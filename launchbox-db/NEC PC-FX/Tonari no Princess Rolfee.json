{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tonari no Princess Rolfee", "overview": "Tonari no Princess Rolfee is a Japanese-style adventure game with some mild simulation elements (Rolfee has parameters that can increase or decrease, depending on the player's actions). Most of the interaction consists of choosing which location to go to (through a menu command). A somewhat unusual feature of the game are its random events. Going to a certain location will trigger random appearances of characters, so there are no clear and secure ways to make certain events happen. Triggering different events leads to different consequences in the story and different endings.", "platform": "NEC PC-FX", "release_date": "July 25, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Fupac", "publishers": "NEC Home Electronics", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.62", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86223-tonari-no-princess-rolfee\n"}
