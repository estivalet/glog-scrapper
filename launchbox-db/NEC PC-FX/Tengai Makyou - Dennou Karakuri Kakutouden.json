{"altername_name": ["Tengai Makyu Karakuri Kakutouden"], "name": "Tengai Makyou: Dennou Karakuri Kakutouden", "overview": "The ancient demon Yomi is about to be revived once again, and warriors all over the land of Jipang have gathered to stop him. But only the strongest of them can fight Yomi, after he has defeated all the others - because this story is but an excuse for fights between familiar characters from Tengai Maky\u014d universe! This fighting game uses the same system as the previously released Battle Heat: each and every move of the characters is displayed as an anime-style movie. The player presses appropriate buttons for offensive and defensive moves (also controlling the power of the move), after which an anime sequence is shown. In both versus mode (against a computer opponent and two-players mode), it is possible to play as some of the most remarkable Tengai Maky\u014d heroes (Ziria, Manjimaru, Kabuki, and others), as well as some of the villains - like the recurrent stupid monkey Mantou.", "platform": "NEC PC-FX", "release_date": "July 28, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Produce", "publishers": "Hudson Soft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86366-tengai-makyou-dennou-karakuri-kakutouden\n"}
