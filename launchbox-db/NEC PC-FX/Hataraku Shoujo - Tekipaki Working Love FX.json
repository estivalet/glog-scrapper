{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hataraku Shoujo: Tekipaki Working Love FX", "overview": "Tekipaki: Working Love FX is essentially an upgraded version of Tekipaki: Working Love for Turbo CD. It adds several scenarios to the main game, which play mostly like a Japanese-style adventure - the player can choose dialogue options or a location to go to. Those scenarios add more background to the personalities of Naomi, Hikaru, and Edalt, the three extra-terrestrial heroines of the game (for example, in one of the scenarios Hikaru's Martian cat escapes from the zoo, and it's the player's job to find him). The PC-FX version of the game also adds an \"omake\" option, where it is possible to view pictures of the girls.", "platform": "NEC PC-FX", "release_date": "March 27, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Studio Offside", "publishers": "NEC Home Electronics", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.86", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106640-hataraku-shoujo-tekipaki-working-love-fx\n"}
