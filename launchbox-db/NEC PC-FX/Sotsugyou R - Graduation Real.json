{"altername_name": ["Sotsugy\u014d: Graduation Real"], "name": "Sotsugyou R: Graduation Real", "overview": "A spin-off in the Sotsugy\u014d/Graduation series, this game is just what its title implies: graduation with real people. Instead of anime-style portraits of school girls, there are pictures (and a few full motion videos) of real Japanese young women. Gameplay follows the same formula as the other graduation games: as a high school teacher, the player's task is to successfully lead five high school girls to their graduation. Most of the activities consist of making schedules, organizing classes, and giving assignments to the girls. It is necessary to know the strength and the weaknesses of each girl, in order to choose correct activities. The teacher supervises not only everything the girls do in the school, but also some of their activities during leisure time, including making plans for the holidays.", "platform": "NEC PC-FX", "release_date": "March 8, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Headroom", "publishers": "NEC", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106626-sotsugyou-r-graduation-real\n"}
