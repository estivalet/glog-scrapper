Each choice advances the clock, so it is necessary to plan well in order not to run out of time and to successfully solve the case.", "platform": "NEC PC-FX", "release_date": "March 22, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "NEC Home Electronics", "publishers": "Riverhill Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.42", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75128-jb-harold-blue-chicago-blues\n"}
