{"altername_name": ["Makeruna! Makend\u014d Z"], "name": "Makeruna! Makendou Z", "overview": "Makeruna! Makend\u014d Z takes place in the same universe as Makeruna! Makend\u014d, known outside of Japan as Kendo Rage. However, unlike the first game (or its sequel), this is a Japanese-style RPG. Like the other Makeruna! Makend\u014d games (the name means Don't lose, magic kendo!), it has comedy elements. The story takes place in a high school attended by two sisters, Hikari and Mai. Their cousin Saya just came back to Japan from the USA, where she was sent as an exchange student. Due to an unfortunate experiment, the gate to the demon world opens in the school. Using their magic kendo powers, the girls have to find portals to the demon world, defeat the demons, and restore peace in the school. Makeruna! Makend\u014d Z plays like a traditional Japanese RPG, with top-down navigation and random turn-based battles viewed from first-person perspective. The gameplay system is simplified even compared to other Japanese RPGs: game progression is strictly linear, and the girls cannot equip anything. They have, however, access to magic spells and various kendo techniques. The game features anime-style movies and still shots. Every kendo technique, for example, is displayed as a full-screen anime-style picture.", "platform": "NEC PC-FX", "release_date": "March 20, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Fill in Caf\u00e9", "publishers": "NEC Home Electronics", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.62", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendo_Rage#Release", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86197-makeruna-makendou-z\n"}
