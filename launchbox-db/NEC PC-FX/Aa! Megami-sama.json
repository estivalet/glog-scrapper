{"altername_name": ["Ah! Megami-sama", "Oh My Goddess!"], "name": "Aa! Megami-sama", "overview": "The game is a remake of the computer game of the same name. It adds an animated intro, voice-overs, and two mini-games. The story is based on the manga/anime series \"Ah! Megami-sama\", depicting the adventures of Keiichi, a Japanese teenager who accidentally summoned the Norse goddess Belldandy and made a wish for her to stay with him forever, which led to all kinds of troubles. What's more, other powerful beings out there are seeking to harm Keiichi's divine girlfriend, so a simple date ends in an unexpected way... The game is a \"digital comic\", meaning that the adventure elements are reduced to the bare minimum: being able to choose dialogue lines or make other decisions from time to time. The mini-games are a timed exercise of putting puzzle pieces together, and a card-matching game against two female opponents.", "platform": "NEC PC-FX", "release_date": "December 12, 1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Banpresto", "publishers": "NEC Home Electronics", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.95", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh_My_Goddess!#Video_games", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ilIShFHpjM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/74907-aa-megami-sama\n"}
