{"altername_name": ["Pachio-kun FX: Maboroshi no Shima Daisakusen"], "name": "Pachio-kun FX: Maboroshi no Shima Daikessen", "overview": "Pachio-kun FX is a pachinko game. The popular pachinko mascot Pachio-kun, who looks like a pachinko ball with legs, is setting up a pachinko tournament on the Ghost Island. The player can choose to control one of the several available characters; even though the choice doesn't affect the gameplay, choosing different characters leads to different anime FMVs displayed during pachinko moves. The goal is to defeat the 7 pachinko masters, who can be met and challenged to a battle at different locations on the island. The battles involve not only using your own pachinko machine, but also freezing the ball the opponent is currently playing for an amount of time. This can be done by playing alone in various pachinko parlors and gathering balls and special points.", "platform": "NEC PC-FX", "release_date": "September 22, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Coconuts Japan Entertainment", "publishers": "NEC Home Electronics", "genres": "Casino", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86204-pachio-kun-fx-maboroshi-no-shima-daikessen\n"}
