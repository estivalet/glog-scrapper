{"altername_name": [], "name": "SAME GAME FX", "overview": "SameGameFX was packed-in with every version of the PC-FXGA boards except obviously FX-98IF which is just a regular PC-FX slapped onto a PC-98 expansion board. SameGameFX is played on a rectangular field, typically initially filled with four or five kinds of blocks placed at random. By selecting a group of adjoining blocks of the same color, a player may remove them from the screen. Blocks that are no longer supported will fall down, and a column without any blocks will be trimmed away by other columns always sliding to one side (often the left). The goal of the game is to remove as many blocks from the playing field as possible.", "platform": "NEC PC-FX", "release_date": "December 8, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Hudson Soft", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://vimeo.com/104316066", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/125170-same-game-fx\n"}
