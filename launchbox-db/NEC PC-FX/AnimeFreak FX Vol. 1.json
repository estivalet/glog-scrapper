{"altername_name": [], "name": "AnimeFreak FX Vol. 1", "overview": "NEC had the idea of releasing what is essentially a PC-FX game magazine in a game CD format. This is the first of what will later become bi-annual animefreak releases. It contains: - A demo of Akazukin Cha-Cha: Osawagase! Panic Race! - A slide show of photos of voice actresses - A karaoke mode for some of the songs used in PC-FX titles - A collection of movies dedicated to Lilith, the heroine of Megami Tengoku II PC-FX-related news - \"Voice Idol\" mode, which contains information about songs used in PC-FX games - The first episode of an anime mini-series called \"Private Eye Doll\" A \"Making Of...\" section. What still allows this CD to qualify as a game is the fact that it also contains a rock-paper-scissors mini-game, which is played against a real actress. The player has to press one of the three main PC-FX controller buttons in time, which correspond to the international hand gestures for rock, paper, and scissors.", "platform": "NEC PC-FX", "release_date": "August 12, 1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "NEC Home Electronics", "publishers": "NEC Home Electronics", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.55", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/106620-animefreak-fx-vol-1\n"}
