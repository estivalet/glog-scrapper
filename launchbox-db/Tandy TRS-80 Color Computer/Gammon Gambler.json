{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gammon Gambler", "overview": "Gammon Gambler offers complete backgammon gameplay for one player against the computer. The pieces are represented by text X's and O's on a graphical board, but the dice and doubling cube are graphically represented. The initial setup of the pieces is chosen randomly from two traditional starting layouts. The rules are enforced, though you can redo your move right up until you pass the dice, even after sending an opposing piece to the bar. The game has ten levels of difficulty and keeps track of the score and the doubling cube over multiple games, but it does not save data between runs of the game.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "The Dream Machine", "publishers": "Personal Software Inc.", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/300254-gammon-gambler\n"}
