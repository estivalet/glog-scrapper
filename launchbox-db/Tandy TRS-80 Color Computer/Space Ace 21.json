{"altername_name": [], "name": "Space Ace 21", "overview": "Space Ace 21 is about building and battling spaceships against either another human player, or the computer AI. Build your spaceship from 21 different available modules to see what strategies work best against your opponents. After designing your craft, the game will run a test and check your ship before shooting you off into space. Once finished, you're up against an opponent in one of three different game modes in either a two or three dimensional galaxy. Game modes consist of: Smuggler, try to get from one side of the screen, around your opponent, and to your base with as much cargo or passengers as you can. Refuel, a one-on-one shoot-out between you and an opponent; game mode allows you to go back to base to refuel with the goal of destroying the enemy. Phoenix Decathlon, a tournament where you face-off against each of the ten computer AI's pre-designed spaceships with the goal of beating them all and being championed as a \"Space Ace\".", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Synergistic Solar Inc.", "publishers": "Synergistic Solar Inc.", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/361260-space-ace-21\n"}
