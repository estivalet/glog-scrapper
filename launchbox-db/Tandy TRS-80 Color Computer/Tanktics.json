{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tanktics", "overview": "It is September 6, 1943. Following the debacle at Kursk, the German Army reels back to the protection of the Dneiper River. The Red Army pursues hard trying to turn a retreat into a rout. You are in charge of a tiny Panzer Group (tank platoon) and you are the only unit capable of stopping them. You are outnumbered 2 to 1 but your orders are firm: stop the Soviet tanks. You command a force up to 8 tanks or anti-tank guns in 5 different scenarios. The computer is your Soviet opponent. Tanktics is played out on a two piece full color 22\" x 16\" mapboard with 240 1/2\" counters while the computer takes care of all the calculations.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Chris Crawford", "publishers": "Avalon Hill", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/367681-tanktics\n"}
