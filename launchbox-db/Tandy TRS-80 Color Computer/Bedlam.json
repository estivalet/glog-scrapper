{"altername_name": ["Bedlam Adventure"], "name": "Bedlam", "overview": "What other game lets you interact with Houdini, Picasso, and Merlin, and even get them to talk to each other? These mental patients may only believe that they're Houdini, Picasso, and Merlin, but they can help you get out, and that is your sole objective in this text adventure. You wake up in a locked mental ward and your wits, a few objects, and the other occupants (inmates, staff, and inmates pretending to be staff) are the resources you must pool to escape. Whom can you trust, and what your route to freedom is, changes with each new game. In this basic text adventure you use commands like GO WEST or GET THE KEY. You can shorten direction commands to WEST or NORTH (or even W or N if you prefer).", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Radio Shack", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/292638-bedlam\n"}
