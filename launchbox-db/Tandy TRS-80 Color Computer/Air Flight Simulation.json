{"altername_name": [], "name": "Air Flight Simulation", "overview": "Take your computer to the skies in Air Flight Simulator as you practice and train to become an expert in piloting maneuvers such as take-offs and landings, as well as learn to use plane instrumentation. This is a title that can be enjoyed by both plane enthusiasts and computer hobbyists as it blends together both aspects of simulation as well as provides the fun and entertainment of a game. Monitor your altitude, airspeed, direction (via compass) engine stress, and the amount of miles traveled. With a maximum range of around 50 miles, you can explore your own piloting abilities and put your skills to the test.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1978", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Dwight W Meyer", "publishers": "Instant Software, Inc", "genres": "Flight Simulator", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/241164-air-flight-simulation\n"}
