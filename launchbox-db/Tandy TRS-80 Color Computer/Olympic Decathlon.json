{"altername_name": ["Microsoft Olympic Decathlon"], "name": "Olympic Decathlon", "overview": "A simulation of the 10-event Olympic Decathlon, this early game was basically a series of 10 arcade games back to back. The player used the keyboard to control how fast the character would go in a race or when to throw the javelin, for example. Decathlon also had a training mode which let you play any of the events individually. A nice feature about the game is that up to six players could play the game in hot seat mode. Several of the events were one player at a time, but many of the races were two at a time, giving you some live competition. You were scored based on your performance at each event and the player with the highest total at the end was awarded the gold medal. The ultimate challenge was to try to beat Bruce Jenner, winner of the Decathlon in the 1976 games.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1980", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Timothy W.
