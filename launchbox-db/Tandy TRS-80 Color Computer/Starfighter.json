The game has 2 modes, a combat trainer and campaign mode. The player plays as a mercenary pilot working for the Solar Galactic Authority, who is currently at war with the Petro Resource Conglomerate. The player is awarded credits for destroying enemy vessels, as well as rogue merchant ships and marauder Solar Galactic Authority vessels. The game is played from a first person point of view, and the player's ship can hyperdrive into different galactic zones to hunt enemy vessels. The accumulated credits can be used to facilitate ship repairs or purchase upgrades for their vessel at a landbase. The player can also refuel at these landbases and acquire bounties. If the player runs out of fuel, they need to request a tow to the nearest landbase at great expense. The player starts off with rank of New Pilot, and can advance to Ensign, Inspector, Captain, and finally Star Lord. The ultimate goal of the game is to claim the rank of Star Lord", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Sparky Starks", "publishers": "Adventure International", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/308813-starfighter\n"}
