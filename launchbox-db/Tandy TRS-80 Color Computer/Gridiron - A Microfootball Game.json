{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gridiron: A Microfootball Game", "overview": "Gridirion: A Microfootball Game is a 2-player American football simulation for the TRS-80. Played from a top-down perspective, gameplay follows basic American football rules. There is no computer opponent available, and actions for both teams must be chosen by the players. During each play, both players choose a respective offensive or defensive play, and then the computer graphically displays the action. If a play is not chosen fast enough, the team will become confused and will perform errors. The players can not control a play in progress. At the end of each play, the current score is displayed. Each team can call 3 timeouts per game.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1979", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Microflair Associates", "publishers": "Hayden Software", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/303324-gridiron-a-microfootball-game\n"}
