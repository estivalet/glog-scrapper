{"altername_name": ["Scott Adams Adventure #07 - Mystery Fun House"], "name": "Mystery Fun House", "overview": "Mystery Fun House is the seventh entry in the original Scott Adams adventure series. The events of the game take place at an amusement park. The first puzzle involves figuring out how to get in past the turnstiles. Once inside, the player must solve the mystery of the place, going through a house of mirrors and so forth. Like the others in the series, the game is a text adventure with a rather basic two-word command parser. The Japanese computer versions feature graphics in addition to the text input.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1979", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Scott Adams", "publishers": "Adventure International", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/219753-mystery-fun-house\n"}
