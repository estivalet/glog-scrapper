{"altername_name": [], "name": "Laser Defense", "overview": "Laser Defense is a 1 - 2 player arcade game for the TRS-80. The player controls a series of satellite-based laser defense platforms, and must stop an incursion of Eastern European nuclear weapons. Played on two maps, the player freely switches between an American and European map. On the map of America, the player must move a cross-hair to target incoming intercontinental ballistic missiles to blow them up before they reach and destroy American cities. If all American cities are lost, it's game over. On the European map, the player must target enemy missile sites and other offensive weapons. If the player destroys all enemy missile sites, they advance to the next level. The enemy nation will also create an Eradicator, which can shoot down the laser defense system. If this is allowed to power up, it's game over. Current Eradicator power and remaining laser defense power are displayed on the bottom of the screen. The game is essentially a derivative of Missile Command.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Med Systems Software", "publishers": "Med Systems Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxe3IRoUFjA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/166177-laser-defense\n"}
