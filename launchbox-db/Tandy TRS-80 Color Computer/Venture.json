{"altername_name": [], "name": "Venture", "overview": "Venture is an unofficial adaption of Exidy's arcade game Venture. The player controls a small character who must navigate a series of passageways to reach the chambers within. Large spiders patrol the hallways, and the player loses a life if they touch one. The player has no ability to shoot in the passageways, and must avoid the spiders. After entering a room, the player moves to a separate screen containing smaller enemies and treasure. Here, the player must fire upon all the enemies, collect the treasure, and then exit out of the room. Back in the passageways, the player must try to navigate to the next chamber.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Horizons Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/329220-venture\n"}
