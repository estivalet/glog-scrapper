{"altername_name": [], "name": "New World", "overview": "New World is a 1 - 3 player strategy game involving colonization of the New World for multiple systems. Starting in 1495, and proceeding in 5-year intervals, players attempt to colonize and exploit the New World. The players can choose from the European nations of England, France, or Spain, and they directly compete against the rival nations, which are either controlled by human or computer players. During each turn, the player can purchase ships, soldiers, or naval movements. Colonists can not be purchased, but can be recruited. These must be loaded onto ships, and transported to one of the many colonies in the New World. The player can use their soldiers to battle with native tribes, and exploit gold from the new land, which must be transported back to Europe. The player also does battle with neighboring European-controlled colonies as they expand their dominion. At the end of each turn, the player receives report regarding their gold production, and transportation back to Europe. The player also receives report on maintenance costs, expenses, and colonist recruitment. Random events can complicate each turn.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Automated Simulations", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "3", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/367624-new-world\n"}
