The player controls a spacecraft which can move in all directions, but can only fire horizontally left and right. The ship is armed with a warp drive that will move it randomly about the screen, and smart bombs which will destroy all enemies on the screen. The player confronts 6 types of enemies who move rapidly about the screen and fire upon the player. There are 15 men represented by the letter I along the bottom of the screen, which must be protected from the aliens, who will try to abduct them. After destroying 25 enemies, the terrain will disappear and the player will be attacked by a swarm of enemies. The player starts with three lives and three smart bombs, and gains 1 of each every 10,000 points. When all lives are lost, it's game over.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Larry Ashmun", "publishers": "Soft Sector Marketing Incorporated", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.8", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/135450-alien-defense\n"}
