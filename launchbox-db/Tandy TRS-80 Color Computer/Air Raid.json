Enemy planes fly horizontally across the screen, and the player must shoot them down from their artillery cannon in the center of the screen. The cannon can be fired at 5 different angles, and when a plane is hit, it bursts into flame and falls to the ground, potentially taking out other planes in its descent. Enemy planes can collide, and fall to the ground. There are 9 levels of game speed, and the player has 99 time units to shoot as many planes as possible.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Small System Software", "publishers": "Level IV Products, Inc.", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/166014-air-raid\n"}
