{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Gobbling Box", "overview": "Gobbling Box is a 1 - 2 player Pac-Man clone for the TRS-80. The gobbler must eat all the dots in a maze, while avoiding the zonkers Chris and Cross. If the player eats an energizer, the zonkers can temporarily become vulnerable, and run from the player. A tame zonker, if eaten, is sent back to the starting area. When the player consumes all dots, they move to a new maze and gain a new gobbler. The player starts with 3 gobbler, and when all are lost, it's game over.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Antony Consentino", "publishers": "Misosys, Inc.", "genres": "", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/367651-the-gobbling-box\n"}
