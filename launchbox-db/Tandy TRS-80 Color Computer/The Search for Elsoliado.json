{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Search for Elsoliado", "overview": "The Search for Elsoliado is a 1-player space exploration and trading game for multiple systems. The player must search the galaxy for the mythical planet Elsoliado. Basic gameplay is an interstellar trading game, where the player navigates their vessel to different quadrants on a large map to buy and sell resources. Players must keep track of which locations offer high and low prices on different commodities to establish trade routes, and their vessel can hold a total of 40 units of any object. Fuel allows a player to travel, and is lost in combat whenever a player fires or takes a hit. Refueling is free at trading posts. There are 5 difficulty levels, which control the player's total fuel allotment. Combat is real time, as the player moves crosshairs, and attempts to shoot alien vessels as they rapidly appear on and off the screen to fire at the player. Before each combat, the player has the opportunity to try to flee combat or bribe their opponents away. As the player explores and accrues resources, they can purchase expensive hints to the location of Elsoliado, with the ultimate goal being to find the lost planet.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Adventure International", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/327930-the-search-for-elsoliado\n"}
