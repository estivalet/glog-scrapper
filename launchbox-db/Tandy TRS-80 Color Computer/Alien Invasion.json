{"altername_name": [], "name": "Alien Invasion", "overview": "Alien Invasion is a 1-player Space Invaders clone for the TRS-80. At the outer ranges of the known universe, far beyond what we can see with our earth based telescopes lies a galaxy 100 times our own. From there, the warlike Archons using their tachyon based telescopes have detected Earth. A lottery was held, and 24 lucky Archons have been chosen to spearhead the invasion of Earth. The player controls a spaceship which can move left and right, and fire vertically. The player confronts 24 alien vessels aligned in 4 rows of 6 vessels. The alien vessels fire upon the player, moving horizontally, while slowly approaching the bottom of the screen. Barriers at the bottom of the screen help block enemy fire. The player must shoot down all 24 vessels before they reach their location. The player has a total of 5 ships, and when all are lost it's game over.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1979", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Roy Niederhoffer", "publishers": "Acorn Software Products", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/148717-alien-invasion\n"}
