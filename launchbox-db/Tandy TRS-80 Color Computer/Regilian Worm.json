{"altername_name": [], "name": "Regilian Worm", "overview": "Regilian Worm is a 1-player arcade game for the TRS-80. As a mighty intergalactic regilian worm, you search out succulent zandszbards to eat. The little beggars are tasty, though a bit explosive. The more you eat, the bigger you grow. The player controls a progressively elongating worm, that must move about and eat zandszbards. If the player strikes their tail or the edge of the screen, it's game over. There are 4 levels of difficulty with 9 speed options.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "The Software Guild", "publishers": "Softsmith Software", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/367683-regilian-worm\n"}
