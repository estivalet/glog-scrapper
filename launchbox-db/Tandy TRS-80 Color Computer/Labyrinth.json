{"altername_name": [], "name": "Labyrinth", "overview": "Labyrinth is a first-person adventure game for multiple systems. You have been deposited in a labyrinth haunted by an evil Minotaur, armed only with a single torch. The player must navigate from a first-person perspective the twisting passageways of the labyrinth, looking for clues and items to defeat their foe. The player has a limited number of turns as they must find more torches and food, or else die of starvation or be killed by the Minotaur in the darkness. The player must solve inventory-based problems, and deal with foes including a gnome, a cave bear, a witch, and an ugly little man. Eventually, the player must lure the Minotaur into the torchlight and slay it with a special weapon.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1980", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Frank Corr", "publishers": "Med Systems Software", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/367605-labyrinth\n"}
