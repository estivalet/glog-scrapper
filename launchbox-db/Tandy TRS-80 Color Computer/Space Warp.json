{"altername_name": [], "name": "Space Warp", "overview": "Your command is the Endever, your mission is the total destruction of the invading Jovian fleet, and your time is limited. In their bid to conquer the galaxy, the Jovians are attacking United Planet System bases; when no base remains, your mission ends in failure. Scanners will help you find the Jovians and the bases, hyperdrive will get you there, and Masers and Triton Missiles will blast the Jovian ships into the ether. It's best to go in with deflectors up, because the game is real-time and the Jovians will start firing before you do. A full damage report is available, with the fastest repairs done at one of the bases. Combat is especially challenging because you must issue numeric commands, including direction and firepower, while listening to the Jovians blast away at you (sound effects driving home the urgency of your situation). Even outside of combat, the Jovian ships will move from quadrant to quadrant, and you may have to fight through magnetic storms or even around invisible black holes. The action is shown via a map of your quadrant, including stars, ships and bases. The general status is directly below that, while scanning and damage reports are shown separately. Ten levels of play vary the number of enemy ships and the bases in jeopardy, to the point of making victory far from inevitable on the higher levels.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1978", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Connan Enterprises", "publishers": "Personal Software Inc.", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/314765-space-warp\n"}
