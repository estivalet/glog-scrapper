{"altername_name": [], "name": "Showdown", "overview": "Showdown is a shooting game similar to the arcade games Gun Fight and Boot Hill. Two gunslingers (human vs. human or human vs. computer) face each other in a duel. The players can move up and down along the sides of the screen, aim by raising or lowering the firing arm and then shoot at the enemy. Some cover is offered in the form of obstacles: trees, cacti and a moving wagon. Reloading is automatic but takes a few seconds. The game keeps track of scores but is endless and there are no winning conditions.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Russell Starkey", "publishers": "Adventure International", "genres": "", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/314762-showdown\n"}
