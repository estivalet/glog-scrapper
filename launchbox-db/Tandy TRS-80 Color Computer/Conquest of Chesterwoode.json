{"altername_name": [], "name": "Conquest of Chesterwoode", "overview": "Conquest of Chesterwoode is a turn-based wargame from Adventure International for 2-4 players. Your ancestors journeyed into the dark Forest of Chesterwoode, facing dreadful basilisks, worgs, a wurm, and more. Eventually civilization was established, and the land divided into 63 provinces, in a convenient hex-shaped grid. Then crops failed, there were food riots, and robbers appeared. Tyrants built fortresses to protect themselves from one another. Now centuries later, as the descendants of those ancients, you want to unite the provinces. To do so however, you must fight, until only one leader remains. Only then will the serfs be freed from their servitude and peace and prosperity come again. Gameplay is similar to typical board wargames with hex squares, but being on the computer, the rules can be far more complex and realistic than in a board game. At least 2 human players are required.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Allan Armstrong", "publishers": "Adventure International", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/115674-conquest-of-chesterwoode\n"}
