{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hercules", "overview": "In this side-scrolling bomber, you pilot the good ship Hercules, flying over Land Rovers which are firing missiles at you. Your mission is to bomb all the Land Rovers into oblivion so you can get on to the presumably easier part of attacking a small town. Fortunately for the town, there is an endless line of Land Rovers defending against your three ships. You're never going to see that town. The Land Rovers are stationary and come five at a time, firing well-aimed missiles. You maneuver your ship over them -- up and down, slow and fast -- dropping just one bomb at a time. Your ship keeps cycling overhead until all five Rovers are gone; misses only use up fuel, which is limited, counts for points, and ticks downward more quickly with each round. There's no bonus ships, difficulty levels, armor, or power-ups: just four arrow keys and three strikes until you're out. True to the genre, the game does give you an instruction screen and a score.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Jon Swartz", "publishers": "ALA Software", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/367595-hercules\n"}
