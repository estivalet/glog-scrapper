{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ball Turret Gunner", "overview": "Ball Turret Gunner is a game with a first person view where you need to gun down enemy vessels (that look suspiciously like Tie Fighters). You have a direction indicator that tells you where the enemy vessel is coming from, and you can rotate your turret a full 360 degrees. However, your laser takes a long time to recharge, so you must aim carefully and not waste your shots.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1980", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Instant Software, Inc", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/263213-ball-turret-gunner\n"}
