{"altername_name": [], "name": "Strike Force", "overview": "Strike Force is a side scrolling shoot 'em up that is most similar to Defender but also has some similarities with Scramble. Like in Defender, the player can move the ship both left and right and has to protect a number of ground targets, here five cities. There is also a radar display that shows an overview with the locations of cities and enemies. In addition to shooting the aliens as they appear the player can also activate shields that offer protection to the cities. These however require energy which is only available in limited supply. Similarities with Scramble include a mountainous terrain that the player has to avoid crashing into and enemy ground targets that can be attacked. To be able to do so the player first has to collect a incendiary star shell that then can be dropped on the target.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Beam Software", "publishers": "Melbourne House", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/367659-strike-force\n"}
