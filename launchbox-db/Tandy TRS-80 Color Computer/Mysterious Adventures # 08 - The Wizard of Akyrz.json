{"altername_name": ["The Wizard of Akyrz"], "name": "Mysterious Adventures # 08 - The Wizard of Akyrz", "overview": "The Wizard of Akyrz is the eighth game in the Mysterious Adventures series. The player begins in the royal palace, where the king asks him to save his daughter from an evil wizard. If the player should succeed, his reward will be priceless. Most instructions are either 90-degree compass moves, or verb-noun commands such as \"get painting\", \"fit chain\" or \"climb tree\". On the player's journey he will discover treasures, which must be stored in a special room, reached via a spell. The game engine has been redone to allow complete sentences, instead of the two-word Scott Adams parser that was used previously.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Brian Howarth", "publishers": "Molimerx Ltd.", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/367826-mysterious-adventures-08---the-wizard-of-akyrz\n"}
