{"altername_name": [], "name": "Airmail Pilot", "overview": "Airmail Pilot is an arcade game for the TRS-80. The player takes control of a Curtis JN4-D (Jenny) tasked with delivering mail from Columbus, Ohio to Chicago, Illinois. Played from a behind perspective, the player can control their aircraft in the 4 cardinal directions. As the player flies, intermittent poor weather will drive their plane vertically and horizontally, and the player must correct for these aberrations. The player must evade freak thunderstorms. The player also has a fuel gauge, and must make stops at airports along their route to Chicago to refuel, to avoid crashing. The player must carefully land on a runway as it appears on the bottom of the screen, and if they miss, they must fly on. The goal is to complete the mail run safely in as little time as possible.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1979", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Instant Software, Inc.", "publishers": "Instant Software, Inc.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airmail_Pilot", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/166013-airmail-pilot\n"}
