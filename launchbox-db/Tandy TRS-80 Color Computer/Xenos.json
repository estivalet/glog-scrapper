Air Force investigators are not just at their wits' end, but have lost them entirely trying to figure out what caused a bright flash and now a glow in a Southwestern canyon. The private, who is driving the jeep which finally brings you to the outskirts of Purgatory, New Mexico, doesn't offer to wait. Xenos is a text adventure that starts you at dawn of the same day on a desert highway, pockets empty and hoofing it toward the complete unknown. With resourcefulness, logic, and a text parser that can handle a few prepositions, who knows where you may end the day?", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Robert Arnstein Corporation", "publishers": "Tandy Corporation", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/329745-xenos\n"}
