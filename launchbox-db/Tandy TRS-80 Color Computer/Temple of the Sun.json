{"altername_name": ["Temple of the Sun Adventure"], "name": "Temple of the Sun", "overview": "Temple of the Sun is a text-based adventure game for the TRS-80. As a student of ancient magical orders, you have accidentally discovered clues leading you to the long buried Cult of the Shaman, an extremely powerful order of wizards whose influence shaped Indian culture in the Western Hemisphere for countless centuries. Now, standing before the Shamans' most sacred shrine, you have a burning desire to fit together the remaining parts of the puzzle. The only way to do that is to become as the ancients, to become, in a trial of courage, a Shaman. All commands are via VERB NOUN text entry, and there is no save or restore feature. The player must explore the halls of the Temple of the Sun, and carefully examine all rooms to gather items for the ritual. The location of many items is randomized. The player also risks encountering deadly snakes and jaguars, which can prematurely end the adventure. After gathering the required items to complete the ritual, the player can become a Shaman, and then must escape to freedom.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1980", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "The Programmer's Guild", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/367684-temple-of-the-sun\n"}
