{"altername_name": [], "name": "Monster Chase", "overview": "Monster Chase is a 1-player arcade game for the TRS-80. The player tries to avoid a monster while conserving their oxygen. The player can move in the 4 cardinal directions, and so can the monster. The player must reach an oxygen control unit within a maze, and bring it to the oxygen device. While doing this, they must avoid a monster which continuously chases them. The player can drill through walls to reach their goal. After the oxygen is turned on, the monster will pursue for some time before succumbing. The player has 500 time units, but time is only displayed during the last 100 units. There are 9 levels of difficulty, with harder levels being more open, making it easier for the monster to eat you.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1980", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Bryan Galdrikian", "publishers": "CLOAD Magazine", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/156885-monster-chase\n"}
