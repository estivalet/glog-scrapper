{"altername_name": [], "name": "Trap", "overview": "Trap is a 2-player arcade strategy game for the TRS-80. Two players control moving characters that leave a progressively longer tail behind them. If the player runs into an object, they are automatically deflected at 90 degrees, presuming there is still space for them to move. The goal is to trap the opponent so that they can not move, causing them to lose the game. The players can optionally have barriers on the map, and can choose to start with 5 shots to free themselves when stuck. There are 3 different speeds available. The game keeps track of each player's wins and losses, and both players use the same keyboard.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1980", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Instant Software, Inc.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/156846-trap\n"}
