{"altername_name": [], "name": "Double Feature: Spook House and Toxic Dumpsite", "overview": "SPOOK HOUSE Horrors! A deranged madman has locked your unconscious form inside of a deserted creep house at a crazy carnival. You awake to some sobering facts: a bomb is set to explode and only 30 real-time minutes stand between you and eternity. Somewhere, somehow you must locate and defuse the explosive - but we'd be less than honest if we thought you had more than a g host of a chance! Brrrr - a real cliffhanger! TOXIC DUMPSITE Something's gone very, very wrong at the Toxic Dumpsite where the treatment and burial of deadly contaminants take place. The entire plant will explode like the Fourth of July in less than 30 minutes - unless you can avoid the many traps and protection systems and shut the plant down in time. Of course, time is the one luxury you haven't got . . . . !", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Adventure International", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBthLf8e724", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40526-double-feature-spook-house-and-toxic-dumpsite\n"}
