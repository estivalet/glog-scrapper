{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Sledge of Rahmul and Merlin's Treasure", "overview": "The Sledge of Rahmul and Merlin's Treasure is a collection of two text-based graphical adventures packaged together for the TRS-80. In Merlin's Treasure, the goal is to locate 10 treasures hidden within a series of underground tunnels, and return safely to the surface. The tunnels are laid out in a grid-like pattern, and the player is able to look in all four directions at any time, allowing them to examine 4 parts of every square room for clues. The game only accepts 2-word responses, and a graphical display is presented to the character of what is in each room. The last 5 inputs are stored on the top right corner for the player to evaluate. In The Sledge of Rahmul, the player enters a darkened cavern in search of the eponymous Sledge of Rahmul. As they enter, a deafening voice rings out, sealing the cavern behind them. Once again, the dungeon is arranged in a square grid, and the player must look in all 4 directions in each square room to gather clues. All commands are via text input, with a graphical display of the player's viewpoint. The player is awarded a score after exiting the dungeon, based upon the number of puzzles they have solved.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Michael D.
