{"altername_name": ["Circus"], "name": "Mysterious Adventures # 06: Circus", "overview": "The seventh in the Mysterious Adventure series of illustrated text adventures by Brian Howarth. Your car has broken down, miles from anywhere. Heading off in search of a gas station, 3 miles down the road you come upon what appears to be a Circus tent, nestled in a small valley. Sounds and music come from inside. As you reach the gate, suddenly there is complete silence. You walk fearfully towards the entrance of the tent, wondering what exactly is going on here. Maybe if you are lucky, you can find some gas here... Around this time, the game engine was replaced with a far more powerful one. Now the games accepted complete sentences. You can hit ENTER to switch between graphics and all text. This made them somewhat easier to play and less frustrating.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Brian Howarth", "publishers": "Molimerx Ltd.", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/367824-mysterious-adventures-06-circus\n"}
