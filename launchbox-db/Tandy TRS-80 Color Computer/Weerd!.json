{"altername_name": ["Weerd"], "name": "Weerd!", "overview": "Weerd is a 1 or 2-player space-themed arcade game for the TRS-80. The player controls a small spaceship which can move horizontally left and right, as well as fire vertically forwards. The goal is to blast hostile alien spaceships. The ship is armed with shields which can be temporarily deployed to block alien fire, but they only last for a short period and don't block alien vessels. The player combats an unending barrage of alien vessels with unique flight paths. Some craft will plummet towards the player, others carpet bomb from high above. Some alien vessels have multiple parts which split to attack the player. The player has 3 lives, and when all are lost, it's game over. The goal is to maximize score.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Big Five Software", "publishers": "Big Five Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/84933-weerd\n"}
