{"altername_name": [], "name": "Empire", "overview": "Empire is a 1-player strategy game for the TRS-80. You have been appointed ruled of a small unimportant piece of European land during the medieval ages. Your country is beset by many problems: no industry, little trade, small army, underpopulation, angry neighbors, plague, and other day-t-day problems a capable leader must learn to face. You'll have a limited number of turns to build your empire into a great size. Five other city-states are also struggling to become emperor, and are directly competing with you. There are a limited number of turns per game based upon the short medieval life expectancy. Each turn, the player is given a weather report which effects crop yields. The player has a chance to purchase or sell grain, as well as allot grain to the army and peasants. This effects birth/death rates, and army efficiency. Each turn, the player also gets to set customs duty, sales tax, and income tax, and can purchase market places, grain mills, foundries, shipyards, soldiers, or work on construction their palace. These can be used to gain future resources. Each turn the player can attack attacking barbarian and opponent forces to gain their land and seize their resources, and the player must maintain a standing army by feeding them and paying resources. As your country increases in size, you will be rewarded with lofty titles including Knight, Prince, King, and finally Emperor. The game was developed by Peter Trefonas and published in the February 1981 issue of CLOAD Magazine.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "February 1, 1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Peter Trefonas", "publishers": "CLOAD Magazine", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/157289-empire\n"}
