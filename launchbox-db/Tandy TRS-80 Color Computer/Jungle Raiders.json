{"altername_name": [], "name": "Jungle Raiders", "overview": "The player controls a small character at the bottom of the screen who moves horizontally, and fires vertically upwards. There are 4 tents in the center of the screen guarded by 4 rows of barricades on each side. Enemies approach from each side, and intermittently fire at the player. The enemies attempt to grab and haul away barricades to the side of the screen, after which they go for more barricades. The enemies will eventually try to haul away the tents. If the enemy hauling a barricade or tent is shot, the item will stay where it was dropped. If the player is hit by enemy fire, they lose a tent, and if a tent is hauled off the screen, the tent is lost. The game is over when all tents are lost.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Dubois and McNamara Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/264924-jungle-raiders\n"}
