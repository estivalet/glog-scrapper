As the block moves, they leave a tail behind, thus making the movable area continuously smaller. A player loses the game if they strike another white line. The goal is to try to box in the opponent to make them strike a white line. At the end of each game, players are awarded a point if they win. The game was packaged with the memory game Symon.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1980", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Kim Watt", "publishers": "Adventure International", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/277354-capture-and-s-y-m-o-n\n"}
