{"altername_name": [], "name": "Donut Dilemma", "overview": "Donut Dilemma is a 1-player arcade game for multiple systems. Angry Angelo has raided Antonio's Donut Factory sending the entire complex amuck! Donuts have come alive and are jumping around in wild frenzies. Machines have gone out of control throwing cooking fat, dough, and icing sugar everywhere! You must help poor Antonio climb ladders, jump platforms and ride elevators to reach the top floor and shut down the factory's power generator which will restore law and order. The player tries to ascend higher in the donut factory. The player can pick up dough, and has a limited number of throws to eliminate bouncing doughnuts. The player can move laterally, jump, and climb ladders. They must avoid laser fire, falls from heights, and successfully navigate moving platforms. There are 10 levels in total, and the goal is to reach the generator at the top.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Nickolas Marentes", "publishers": "Fun Division", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/348723-donut-dilemma\n"}
