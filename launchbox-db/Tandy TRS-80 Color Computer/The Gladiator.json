{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Gladiator", "overview": "The Gladiator is a 1-player arcade game for the TRS-80. The player is trapped in the arena, armed with a laser gun and shield. The player can move in all directions, and can fire in the cardinal directions. The shield can be briefly activated to protect from enemy fire, but has a limited life. Four droid competitors enter the arena, and try to destroy the player. Surrounding the arena are 4 trackers, which fire randomly into the arena. At the beginning of each match, a field protects the player and trackers, but this is destroyed by tracker fire. If all trackers and droids are defeated, the player progresses to the next level.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nickolas Marentes", "publishers": "Fun Division", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/367906-the-gladiator\n"}
