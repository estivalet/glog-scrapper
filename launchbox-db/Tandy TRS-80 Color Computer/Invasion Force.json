{"altername_name": ["Invasion Force (26-1906)"], "name": "Invasion Force", "overview": "Protect the galaxy against the hated and feared Jovians. You are in command of the USS Hephaestus in this space action game. You will have to manage your energy resources carefully so that you don't run out and get stranded in space. Keep close watch for any available space stations, while managing energy levels and weapons, and responding to Jovian attacks. This game requires quick decisions on your part, as all action is in real-time. While the clock on your screen is running, energy will be consumed and Jovian ships in your sector of space will change position. There are 10 levels of difficulty, which also changes the speed of the Jovians' attack.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1979", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Radio Shack", "publishers": "Radio Shack", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/84927-invasion-force\n"}
