{"altername_name": [], "name": "Frogger", "overview": "Although there were many Frogger adaptations for the TRS-80, this Cornsoft Group version, written by Robert Pappas, was licensed by Sega and was the \u201cofficial\u201d Frogger. The premise of Frogger is simple. The goal is to guide as many frogs as possible back to their homes, crossing a busy road and dangerous river in the process. The TRS-80 version of Frogger offers a choice of five difficulty levels and an option to play background music. The famous theme music, taken from the Japanese children\u2019s song \u201cInu No Omawarisan,\u201d is the same used by the original arcade version. Most TRS-80 games played music during title screens and sound effects during the game, but Frogger was one of the few to also play background music during the game. This was not an easy feat on a computer with no sound controller.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Robert Pappas", "publishers": "The Cornsoft Group", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/160454-frogger\n"}
