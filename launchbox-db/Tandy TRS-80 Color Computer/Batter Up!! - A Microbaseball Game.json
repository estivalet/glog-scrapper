{"altername_name": ["Batter Up"], "name": "Batter Up!!: A Microbaseball Game", "overview": "Batter Up!!: A Microbaseball Game is a 2-player arcade-themed baseball game for the TRS-80. Gameplay takes place primarily from a black and white side-view, featuring a batter and pitcher. The two players take turns throwing pitches, where the pitcher can control the height and speed of the pitch. If the batter comes in contact with the pitch, the details of the action are automatically calculated, and the number of bases, or whether runs are scored is calculated without player control of outfielders. Game details, including: inning, hits, runs, and score are all displayed on the bottom of the screen during pitching/batting. Players create their team names at the beginning of each session, and all players have the same statistics. A complete game consists of 9 innings, and extra innings if applicable.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1979", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Karl Savon", "publishers": "Hayden Software", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/276852-batter-up-a-microbaseball-game\n"}
