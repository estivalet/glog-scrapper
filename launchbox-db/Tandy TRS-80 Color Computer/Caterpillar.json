{"altername_name": [], "name": "Caterpillar", "overview": "A clone of the arcade game Centipede, the player controls a character that can move horizontally and a short distance vertically, and fires to the top of the screen. Long caterpillars approach from the top moving in horizontal strips towards the bottom of the screen, and split into multiple smaller caterpillar components when shot. Caterpillars that reach the bottom of the screen can either turn into large spiders which move about the screen, or begin to move upwards to the top of the screen. Fleas will drop from the top of the screen leaving more obstacles in their path. When all caterpillars are shot, another wave approaches. The player has a total of 3 lives, and the goal is to maximize score.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Larry Ashmun", "publishers": "Soft Sector Marketing Incorporated", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/262740-caterpillar\n"}
