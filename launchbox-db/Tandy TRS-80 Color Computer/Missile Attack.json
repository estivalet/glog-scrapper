The player has a limited number of shots, and receive points for intercept missiles before they reach the cities. Missile barrages come in waves, and the player is awarded a bonus for the number of remaining cities and missiles at the end of each wave. Each progressive wave has more and faster moving missiles, with a higher bonus score between rounds. If a missile silo is destroyed, it is rebuilt between rounds, but cities remain destroyed permanently. If all cities are destroyed, it's game over.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1980", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "The Cornsoft Group", "publishers": "Adventure International", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/304083-missile-attack\n"}
