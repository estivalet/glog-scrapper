{"altername_name": [], "name": "Penetrator", "overview": "Penetrator involves guiding your ship through a horizontally-scrolling arrangement of caverns, in a manner similar to Scramble. The ship must avoid crashing into the surface of the caverns (which have a jagged pattern of being higher in some parts than in others), or the mounted radar bases or seeker missiles. Fortunately you are armed with both a forward-shooting laser and downward-arcing bombs. The game has a training mode, which is useful to help you practice the game with infinite lives, as well as a simultaneous 2-player mode. There's also an editor allowing you to design the cavern layout yourself, and save your creations to tape.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Beam Software", "publishers": "Melbourne House", "genres": "", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/308877-penetrator\n"}
