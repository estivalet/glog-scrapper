{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Battle of Zeighty", "overview": "The Battle of Zeighty is a single-player strategy game. Congratulations! You have just been appointed general of a small and struggling army, in a small and struggling country. You should consider this an honor, even though the army has had six generals in the last two months. Somehow, each general seemed to mysteriously disappear after a battle was lost. To defeat the enemy nation, you must conquer The Zeighty Pass, a highly defended pass through an otherwise impassable mountain range, and the sole supply route for the enemy's advanced troops. If the pass can be conquered, the tide of war will turn in your nation's favor. The player arranges an army of 10 units, which can be chosen from armored infantry, tanks, mine layers, and artillery. Armored infantry and takes serve as combat troops, while artillery can bombard enemy positions from a distance. Mine layers can deploy mines to destroy enemy units. Gameplay occurs on a battlefield, where the player can move their units in 8 directions, and issue attack commands. The player controls a home base, which must be defended, and fog of war allows enemy units to hide when at a sufficient range. Each unit starts with 1000 health units, and will progressively take damage during combat until they are destroyed. Victory is achieved by destroying the enemy's base to the north.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "George Geczy", "publishers": "JMG Software", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/367686-the-battle-of-zeighty\n"}
