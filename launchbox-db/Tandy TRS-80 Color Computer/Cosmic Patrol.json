{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cosmic Patrol", "overview": "Cosmic Patrol is a 1-player space-themed shooter for the TRS-80. The Cosmic Patrol program puts you in the command chair of a small interstellar patrol craft. Your mission is to defend Terran space and prey on the Quelon supply ships which carry essential parts and lubricants for that implacably hostile robotic force. The drone freighters are fairly easy pickings for the accomplished starship pilot, but beware of the I-Fighter escorts. They're armed, fast and piloted by intelligent robots linked to battle computers. They never miss. The player has 999 time units to defeat 15 alien vessels. The player loses 10 units when they fire at a target, and 50 time units if shot by an enemy I-Fighter. The Quelon supply ships move slowly across the screen, while the I-Fighters rapidly approach and attack the player.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1980", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Instant Software, Inc", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/367571-cosmic-patrol\n"}
