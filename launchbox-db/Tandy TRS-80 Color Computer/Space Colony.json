{"altername_name": [], "name": "Space Colony", "overview": "Space Colony is a 1-player arcade game for the TRS-80. The player controls a small ship which moves horizontally on the bottom of the screen and fires vertically upwards. Numerous shields block player and enemy fire. The enemy ships move horizontally until they reach the edge of the screen, move down, and continue their assault. The player's goal is to destroy all enemy vessels before one reaches the bottom of the screen. The plyer loses a life if hit, and it's game over if all 5 lives are lost.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1980", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Kim Watt", "publishers": "Adventure International", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/153776-space-colony\n"}
