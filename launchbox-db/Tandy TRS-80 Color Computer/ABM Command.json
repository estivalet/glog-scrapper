{"altername_name": [], "name": "ABM Command", "overview": "ABM Command is a 1-player arcade game for the TRS-80 written by Arnold E. van Beverhoudt Jr. and published in the October 1981 issues of SoftSide Magazine, Issue #37. The player controls the American ICBM defense system, as missiles fall towards the major cities of Boston, New York, Washington, and Miami. The ABM defense is centrally located between the 4 cities, and the player must move a crosshair to fire a missile and intercept the descending ICBM. Each city can withstand 3 hits before being completely destroyed, and when all 4 cities are destroyed or the central command is hit, it's game over. The player gains points for destroying enemy spy satellites and ICBMs, but loses points for each ICBM which hits a target. A building is rebuilt every 25,000 points. The game was developed by Arnold E. van Beverhoudt Jr., but was credited as Arnold E. van Beverhout, Jr. on the title screen.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "October 1, 1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Arnold E. van Beverhoudt Jr.", "publishers": "SoftSide Magazine", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/166011-abm-command\n"}
