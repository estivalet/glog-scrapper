{"altername_name": [], "name": "5-Speed Racer", "overview": "5-Speed Racer is a top-down arcade racer. The goal is to race down the hill and get as many points as possible in the allotted time. As the title of the game suggests, there are five gear levels. The faster you go, the higher your score. Hitting the curb or driving in the grass will drop your speed to one and will decrease your score as long as you remain off-track.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1978", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Advanced Graphics", "publishers": "Advanced Graphics", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/169618-5-speed-racer\n"}
