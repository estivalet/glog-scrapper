{"altername_name": [], "name": "Meteor Mission", "overview": "Meteor Mission is an arcade action game for two players. Unlike its sequel it is not a variant of Lunar Rescue although it has some minor similarities. The game takes place after a second big bang has occurred and the galaxy is full of stray meteors. Each player's job is to take control of a space ship and move it through the meteor belt to a space station and dock. The meteors move across the screen from left to right while the players' space ships are located at the bottom of the screen and the space stations at the top. The game is played with only two keys: up and down with no horizontal movement of the ship possible. If a player collides with a meteor he gets to restart at the bottom. When reaching the space station one point is earned. A game goes on for three minutes and the player with most points at the end will win. If the score is equal the game will continue until one player has scored. Reaching a high score will lead to extra time. Before playing a difficulty can be selected which affects the amount of meteors.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1980", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Bill Hogue", "publishers": "Big Five Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/158685-meteor-mission\n"}
