{"altername_name": ["Space War"], "name": "Space War!!", "overview": "Space War is a 2-player space fighter for the TRS-80. Two players each control a spaceship orbiting a large heavenly body. The gravitational pull of this sun causes the players to orbit about the center of the screen. Players can rotate clockwise or counterclockwise, accelerate, fire, and enter hyperspace. Hyperspace teleports the player randomly about the screen. The goal is to shoot down the enemy vessel without crashing into the sun, and the program keeps track of score. Players can choose from 5 types of gameplay, ad well as 3 speeds of ship movement and missile movement.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1979", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Device Oriented Games", "publishers": "Acorn Software", "genres": "", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/314764-space-war\n"}
