{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sky Warrior", "overview": "Sky Warrior is a black and white side-scrolling space shooter for the TRS-80. The player controls a spaceship that can move in 4 cardinal directions. The ship can only fire in one direction, down and to the right. The player must fly through a tunnel which scrolls from the right, while avoiding striking the ceiling or the floor. The player must also avoid enemy rockets fired from the ground, while shooting fuel silos which help power their vessel. The player has 3 spaceships, and if they are hit by enemy rockets or strike a wall, they lose a ship and must start over from the beginning of the level. If the player loses 3 ships, it is game over.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Robert Shragg", "publishers": "Adventure International", "genres": "", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/367626-sky-warrior\n"}
