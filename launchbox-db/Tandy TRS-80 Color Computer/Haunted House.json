{"altername_name": [], "name": "Haunted House", "overview": "Generations have passed since the family mysteriously disappeared and the house has been vacant for decades now. Its two story image shows years of neglect, visible only from the narrow, winding road that has been distorted by vegetation from the surrounding forest. Your goal once you enter the house is to find the escape from the Haunted House. Haunted House is an early tape-based text adventure. It has a standard two-word parser, such as 'Get Key' or 'Kill Ghost', to play the game.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1979", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Device Oriented Games", "publishers": "Radio Shack", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/300858-haunted-house\n"}
