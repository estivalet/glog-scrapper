{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dancing Demon", "overview": "You have befriended this phenom, this former commissary attendant of limited IQ but limitless energy and talent. Your task is to compose music and choreograph dance routines for him. Then sit back, watch the curtain rise at the next gig (Belvedere Theater, Oskowatcha, Washington), and enjoy the show. This musical game translates two octaves of notes with sharps and flats to the computer keyboard, playing them as you compose. Rests are possible, but no half-notes or quarter-notes. For the dance routine, you can choose from eighteen different moves, varying in length and complexity from steps to spins, squats, and stomps. For inspiration, two routines are included, but you can save your own to create a vast repertoire for the demon. Each show raises the curtain on a hulking figure who dominates the stage, but adeptly -- indeed, enthusiastically -- matches every step you program, to the tune you composed.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1980", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Leo Christopherson", "publishers": "80-NW Publishing Company", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/284277-dancing-demon\n"}
