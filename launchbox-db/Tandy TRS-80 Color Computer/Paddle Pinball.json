{"altername_name": [], "name": "Paddle Pinball", "overview": "Paddle Pinball is a pinball game without flippers, but with a single paddle which you can move back and forth across the bottom of the screen. All the elements of pinball are here, with bumpers, pins, pockets, beeps, a siren, and even music. The paddle can be moved at two different speeds and can hit the ball harder when gravity has robbed the ball of momentum. Up to three players can split the credits and take turns playing, with more credits available at point thresholds. A random match point which is awarded at the end might get you another credit. The game also features a graphical editor, allowing you to move elements, even add pins, and save your new board.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Eric Quintana", "publishers": "Tandy Corporation", "genres": "", "max_players": "3", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/314766-paddle-pinball\n"}
