A blaring klaxon awakens the player from slumber within their survival pod. Their ship is on a collision course with an oncoming planetoid, and the autopilot is non-functional. The player must repair their ship's autopilot to survive the oncoming landing. The player lands in what appears to be a medieval fantasy land, but across a great lake they see an ultramodern city. After contending with centaurs, ogres, and other dangerous creatures, the player must summon a ferryman to take them to the modern city. All commands are via VERB NOUN text entry. The player must gather items to solve inventory-based puzzles, and there is a save/restore feature available.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "William Demas", "publishers": "Fantastic Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/367895-talking-adventure-forbidden-planet-part-1\n"}
