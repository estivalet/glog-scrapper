Your neighbor's sole objective is to utterly annihilate you. As the tension mounts while you are conducting espionage, building bombers, missiles, submarines and anti ballistic missiles either you or your neighbor launch a pre-emptive first strike.The nuclear destruction continues until either all weapons are expended or a truce is negotiated.
