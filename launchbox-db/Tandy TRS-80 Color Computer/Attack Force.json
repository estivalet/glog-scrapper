{"altername_name": ["Attack Force (1980)(Big-5)"], "name": "Attack Force", "overview": "Attack Force is a Targ variant. As such it is a shoot 'em up that takes place in a grid-like maze where the player's ship starts out in the bottom right corner while eight alien ramships start out in the top row. As the game begins, the ramships will start chasing the player who has to shoot them to prevent getting caught. In addition to the ramships there are flagships that initially are located to the right, outside the playing field. From there they can zap the ramships and thereby turn them into clones of the player's ship. These has to be avoided since shooting them will lead to the player too getting killed. Once all ramships have been destroyed the flagships will enter the playing field and they have to be destroyed to progress to the next level. Flagships can hit the player with laser bolts from any position in the maze (and they never miss) but the player can take six such hits before being destroyed.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1980", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bill Hogue", "publishers": "Big Five Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDrTc3A_go0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/84922-attack-force\n"}
