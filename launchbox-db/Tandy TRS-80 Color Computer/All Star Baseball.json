{"altername_name": ["Allstar Baseball"], "name": "All Star Baseball", "overview": "All Star Baseball is a baseball game for two players by David J. Bohlke and published in the July 1979 issue of SoftSide Magazine Issue #10. Players compete in 9 innings of baseball. The pitcher has an option to throw a fastball, change up, or sinker. The batter can attempt to hit, steal, or bunt. If the player steals or bunts, they're either successful and gain a base, or they'll be out. For a hit, if the player misses the ball once, they're out. If they connect with the ball, the game switches to an arcade sequence where the outfielder must move horizontally to try to catch the fly ball or grounder. If the outfielder is unsuccessful, the player gains bases, which are graphically displayed on the screen. There are no extra innings, and players take their bases automatically.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "July 2, 1979", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "David J.
