{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bridge Challenger", "overview": "Bridge Partner is a 1-player simulation of the card game bridge. A game designed to allow a player to train their bridge skill. It is entirely text based, and all commands are inputted via text prompt. The computer deals at least 10 million different hands. The player and dummy player compete against the computer in regular contract bridge. Or the player can use the dealer subprogram to specify a criterion for high card points and Bridge Partner will deal four new hands. The player can create customized hands to practice, and can save specific hands for future replay. This even allows Bridge Partner to test itself against the bridge game from the local newspaper. Later releases of the game featured an implementation of 3D Tictactoe on a 4x4x4 grid to fill up the remaining space on the tape.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1978", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "George Duisman", "publishers": "Personal Software Inc.", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/333773-bridge-challenger\n"}
