{"altername_name": [], "name": "Insect Frenzy", "overview": "The player controls a small ship that can move laterally, and fires vertically upwards. A large centipede begins to descend the screen by travelling in rows, and the player must shoot all pieces of the centipede before it reaches the bottom of the screen. When the creatures is hit, it divides into smaller pieces, and leaves blockades behind. Spiders appear on the screen to attack the player. Fleas drop from above and scorpions travel horizontally across the screen. When the player clears a level, they move to a more difficult challenge. The player has 3 lives, and when all are lost, it's game over.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Dubois and McNamara Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/267332-insect-frenzy\n"}
