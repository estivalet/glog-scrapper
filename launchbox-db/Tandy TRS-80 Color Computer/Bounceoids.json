{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bounceoids", "overview": "Bounceoids is a science-fiction themed arcade game for the TRS-80. Gameplay is similar to the more famous Asteroids, where the player controls a small ship which can rotate 360 degrees and fire forwards. The ship can accelerate to move, and also has a shield which can offer temporary invincibility. The player must shoot a variety of asteroids and alien menaces. There are a total of 10 difficulty levels which control the size, shape, and speed of asteroids. The player starts with 3 ships, and the skill level increases and a new ship is awarded every 10,000 points. Every 20,000 points brings on a bonus stage.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Robert Pappas", "publishers": "The Cornsoft Group", "genres": "", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/333774-bounceoids\n"}
