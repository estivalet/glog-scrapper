{"altername_name": [], "name": "Alexis", "overview": "Alexis is a text adventure game for the TRS-80. You are Alexis, rightfully King Alexis V, and heir to the throne of the island of Xanthus in the Greek archipelago. When your father Alexis IV died, General Tarkaan took over the kingdom and put you in jail. Your goal is to recover the kingdom and wear the crown of Xanthus once more. The player starts their adventure in General Tarkaan's jail, and must gain their freedom. The player's goal is then to raise an army to combat Tarkaan on the island of Tripolis by bringing them the Crystal Sphere from Hades. The player must explore several other Greek islands to accomplish this, and must carefully watch the weather and their direction while at sea. After bringing their army to confront General Tarkaan, the game briefly takes on a strategy component, where the player chooses military tactics from a list. At the end of the adventure, the length of the player's reign is determined by how many turns were required to complete the game. All entries are via VERB NOUN entry. There are multiple inventory-based puzzles to solve. There is no save/restore feature available.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "CLOAD Magazine", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/166654-alexis\n"}
