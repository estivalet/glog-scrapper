{"altername_name": [], "name": "Computer Acquire", "overview": "Computer Acquire is adapted from the board game Acquire by Avalon Hill. As in most games of high finance it is about making profits by buying low and selling high. Instead of the normal commodity or utility markets the simulation is based on hotel property stocks with mergers and hotel chaining. The goal is spotting the bargains early when the price is right along with adding more hotel chains to which you have controlling interest. Sprinkle in a little market luck along the way and win by becoming the wealthiest player. The game is turn based and allows you to play against the computer with up to six other players or allows the computer to play itself while you observe. The game has five skill levels and hotel chains have seven classes from moderate to prestigious. Each player starts with $6,000 and the game usually ends when one chain has at least 41 hotels.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1980", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "4D Interactive Systems", "publishers": "The Avalon Hill Game Company", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "6", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Acquire", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161347-computer-acquire\n"}
