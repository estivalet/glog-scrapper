{"altername_name": [], "name": "Suns", "overview": "Suns is a 1-player arcade game for the TRS-80. Played on a 3 x 3 grid, suns appear randomly and begin to bounce vertically on all 9 positions. Each square is a door, and only one door can be opened at a time. The goal is to capture as many suns as possible by opening a door just before the sun reaches it. Suns can also be captured by shooting a missile from one of the 9 doors, but only one missile can be fired at a time. If a missile is fired from a door without a sun, it will bounce until it is recaptured again by opening a door. There are 8 levels of difficulty, which determine the maximum suns that can be on the screen at a time from 1 - 8. There are also 5 speed levels to choose from. The player has 100 seconds to collect as many suns as possible.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Alex Kreis", "publishers": "CLOAD Magazine", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151033-suns\n"}
