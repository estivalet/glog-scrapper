{"altername_name": ["LifeTwo"], "name": "Life Two", "overview": "Life Two are games based upon John Conway's Game of Life Contains a TRS-80 implementation of the Game of Life. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction. Also contains a competitive form called The Battle of Life, where 2 - 4 players place 1 - 5 animated characters in a 10 x 5 board. Every 5 generations, the remaining players can place two more lifeforms. Gameplay continues until there is only a single player remaining.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1979", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Leo Christopherson", "publishers": "80-NW Publishing Company", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/367620-life-two\n"}
