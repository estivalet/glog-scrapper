{"altername_name": ["Stellar Escort (1982)(Jeff-Zin-Big-5)"], "name": "Stellar Escort", "overview": "Stellar Escort was written by Jeff Zinn, and it was the first game distributed by Big Five Software that wasn\u2019t written by Bill Hogue. Stellar Escort has a very distinctive look because of the flashy transition effects when changing screens. There is always something in movement on the screen. Stellar Escort has a number of sound effects, but no music or voices. Most people considered the Big Five Software games to be the finest games ever written for the TRS\u201180 Model I and III. They were sold directly through Big Five and were resold by many other companies. Radio Shack also sold Big Five games in two collections compiled by Cogito Software. Games Pack Two and Games Pack Three first appeared in the 1984 Radio Shack catalog and contained four Big Five games: Defense Command, Stellar Escort, Cosmic Fighter and Meteor Mission 2. The names Big Five Software and Bill Hogue were legendary in the field of TRS\u201180 games. Bill Hogue and Jeff Konyu created Big Five Software in order to market their TRS\u201180 games. Two early Big Five games, Super Nova and Galaxy Invasion, redefined the way TRS\u201180 games looked and acted and influenced the games that followed. For many, the final Big Five game for the TRS\u201180 marked the end of the TRS\u201180 game market.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1980", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Big Five Software", "publishers": "Big Five Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmbqQSkQUzg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/84931-stellar-escort\n"}
