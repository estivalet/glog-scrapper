{"altername_name": [], "name": "X-Wing Fighter", "overview": "X-Wing Fighter by Rev. George Blank The Death Star Space Station, under the command of Darth Vader, is the most powerful weapon the universe has ever known. A frontal attack by any other craft would be absolute suicide. However, there is a small unshielded exhaust port on the surface of the Death Star that leads directly to the main reactor. If you can slip your small fighter past the Death Star's defenses and make a direct hit on the port with a torpedo, there is a chance it will penetrate the main reactor and start a chain reaction, destroying the Death Star. The X-wing Fighter is a small rocket armed only with a laser cannon and 3 torpedoes. Use the laser cannon to fight off Imperial Fighters, and save the torpedoes for the Death Star. Target acquisition radar detects targets in excess of 100,000 km away, but only displays those within 20,000 km. Therefore, you will be warned of approaching targets on the right side of your control panel before they're displayed on the radar screen.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1979", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Rev.
