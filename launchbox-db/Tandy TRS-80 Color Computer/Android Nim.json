{"altername_name": [], "name": "Android Nim", "overview": "Android Nim is a representation of the mathematical game Nim. Players take turns removing a desired quantity from a number of distinct heaps. The player to remove the last item wins, but a player can only remove items from a single heap per turn. In this version the heaps are represented by text-mode animated androids and removing items is done by selecting which lasers to fire. The player can only play against the computer.
