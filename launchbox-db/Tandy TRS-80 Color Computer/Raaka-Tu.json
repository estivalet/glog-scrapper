{"altername_name": ["Raaka-Tu Adventure"], "name": "Raaka-Tu", "overview": "On a research grant for your Ph.D. project, you are searching for the lost Khazhadim tribe in the jungles of Nepal. An ancient woman interrupts your morning coffee both to point out the direction of the horrifying temple of the god, Raaka-Tu, and to beg you not to go there. Being a rational anthropologist, you disregard her warnings, accept the sign of good fortune she traces on your forehead, and set off alone into the impenetrable jungle. In this text adventure your objective is to find and enter the temple, grab some artifacts, get out alive, and return to camp. The text parser handles prepositions, so interaction with objects can be relatively sophisticated.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Radio Shack", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/313091-raaka-tu\n"}
