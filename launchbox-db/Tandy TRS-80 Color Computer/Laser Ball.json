{"altername_name": [], "name": "Laser Ball", "overview": "Laser Ball is similar to Pac-Man but has two major differences from the Namco game. For starters, the maze is empty when the game starts and instead of eating all the dots the objective is to drop dots so that the whole maze is completely covered by them. The other big difference is how the power pills (here called stimulators) work. Like in Pac-Man they allow the player (the laser ball) to go after the enemies (which are called destructoids) but instead of eating them it shoots lasers at them. Lasers are only available for a short while but there is no limit on how many shots can be made within that time. If the laser ball is touched by a destructoid during this time, the destructoid will piggyback on the ball and destroy it when the charge ends. To shake it off, the player has to turn a three- or four way intersection at a 90 degree angle.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Adventure International", "genres": "", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/267405-laser-ball\n"}
