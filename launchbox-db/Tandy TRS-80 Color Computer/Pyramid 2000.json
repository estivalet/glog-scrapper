{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pyramid 2000", "overview": "Having discovered the Great Lost Pyramid beneath the desert sand, with the seal on its entrance still intact, you set up your computer to explore the undisturbed tomb. This modern \"Astral Projection\" technique of exploration puts at your command an Astral body for you to direct through the pyramid. It is as limited as your own body, and short in vocabulary. Your object is to collect all the treasures. And, of course, beware of the mummy! Pyramid 2000 is a text adventure which shares most of its rooms, treasures, and puzzles with Adventure and Colossal Cave, but casts them in ancient Egyptian garb. The text parser accepts no more than two words at a time, so communicating with your astral projection is part of the puzzle.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1979", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Device Oriented Games", "publishers": "Radio Shack", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/314734-pyramid-2000\n"}
