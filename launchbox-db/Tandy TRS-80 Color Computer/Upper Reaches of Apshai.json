Otherwise, gameplay is pretty much the same and resembles other graphical Roguelikes / mainframe DND-Clones: You're in control of a solo character, running through a dungeon, killing monster, getting experience, evading traps and finding treasures.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "DLC", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Automated Simulations", "publishers": "Epyx Inc.", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/367810-upper-reaches-of-apshai\n"}
