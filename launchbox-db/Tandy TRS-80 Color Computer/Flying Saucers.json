{"altername_name": [], "name": "Flying Saucers", "overview": "The problem: years of launching spy satellites have filled the sky so much that plane travel is limited to Wednesdays -- every other Wednesday, in fact. The solution: your reflexes, marksmanship, and a big cannon. Shoot as many \"spy saucers\" out of the sky as you can, in a limited time and as accurately as possible. At the bottom center of the screen is the cannon, which you can angle in five different positions. Some saucers are worth more than others, and on rare occasion you get a shot at one which will destroy all the others if you hit it. Go light on the trigger: missiles are expensive, which means you lose points for misses, not to mention saucers which get away.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1979", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Radio Shack", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/348737-flying-saucers\n"}
