{"altername_name": [], "name": "Invaders", "overview": "Invaders is a Space Invaders clone for the TRS-80. Alien invaders from deep space are now approaching our planet in great swarms to colonize the Earth. The invaders feel they must destroy all life forms in order to guarantee their own survival. Six armored barriers still exist in your sector to shield you from above, but you know that with time, they will be destroyed leaving you helpless. The player controls a small ship which moves horizontally on the bottom of the screen, and fires vertically upwards. Swarms of alien vessels move laterally across the screen, slowly descending towards the player. The player can take 5 hits before game over. The game tracks enemy ships and flying saucers destroyed, but also deducts points for each missed shot.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1979", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kim Watt", "publishers": "Level IV Products", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/167119-invaders\n"}
