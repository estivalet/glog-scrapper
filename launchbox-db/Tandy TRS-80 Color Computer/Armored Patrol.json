{"altername_name": [], "name": "Armored Patrol", "overview": "Essentially the first home computer version of the Atari coin-op game Battlezone, Armored Patrol is a 3-D tank battle simulation. Your perspective is from inside your tank looking out at an alien landscape. Your mission is to find and destroy enemy tanks and robots before they destroy you. The terrain is filled with buildings, behind which both you and the enemy tanks can hide. Score points by hitting the enemy tank before it shoots you, and watch out for robots that can drain your tank of energy.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1981", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Terry Gilman", "publishers": "Adventure International", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.8", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/144655-armored-patrol\n"}
