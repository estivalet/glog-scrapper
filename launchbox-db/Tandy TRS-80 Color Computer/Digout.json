{"altername_name": [], "name": "Digout", "overview": "Digout is a 1-player arcade game for the TRS-80. Plays similar to the arcade game Dig Dug. The player controls a small character in the center of the screen, while enemy creatures move about in available spaces. The player can move through solid ground leaving tunnels behind, and the enemies can intermittently dig through the dirt as well. Each enemy takes five hits to destroy, but becomes stunned while the player shoots at them. The goal for each level is to destroy all present enemies to move to a more difficult challenge. The player has a total of three lives, and loses one if struck by an enemy.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "John Crane", "publishers": "Computer Shack", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/367572-digout\n"}
