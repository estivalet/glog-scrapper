{"altername_name": [], "name": "ICBM", "overview": "ICBM is a 1-player strategy game for the TRS-80 by Rod Fitzgerald, released in the April 1980 installment of SoftSide Magazine Issue #19. You are the radar controller at a surface-to-air missile installation guarding Strategic Area Command Headquarters. You have just picked up a Russian ICBM heading your way. You must launch a surface-to-air missile to intercept and destroy the incoming ICBM. The player controls the bearing and angle of the defensive missile, with the goal to position the missile within 1.5 miles of the incoming ICBM to allow for its detonation. Each radar sweep, the player can input a new bearing and angle to try to position closer to the ICBM. If the ICBM makes it to its goal, it's game over.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "April 1, 1980", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Rod Fitzgerald", "publishers": "SoftSide Magazine", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feOfNiqdL0M", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/166180-icbm\n"}
