{"altername_name": [], "name": "Chicken", "overview": "Chicken is an arcade game for the TRS-80. The player controls a chicken whom can move left and right, who tries to cross a busy 10-lane highway. The player must navigate between spaces in traffic to try to cross to the other side unharmed. The player starts with 3 chickens, and gains an additional chicken every 2500 points. There are 999 time units to cross the highway, and the score for each crossing is based upon remaining time. If the player spends too much time between highways, an ambulance will cross and strike the chicken. When all chickens are lost, it's game over.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Factory Programming", "publishers": "Soft Sector Marketing Incorporated", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/367564-chicken\n"}
