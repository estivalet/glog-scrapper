{"altername_name": [], "name": "Adventure Dungeon", "overview": "Adventure Dungeon is a 1-player roleplaying game for the TRS-80. You wish to join the wise council, but to do that you must prove your worth by passing the test of power. You must overcome 5 levels of a dangerous dungeon and retrieve treasures and defeat monsters. Each level is arranged in a large field, where the player can only see the items directly surrounding them. The goal is to defeat every monster and retrieve all treasures. Monsters are stationary, and enter combat when approached, or the player takes a treasure adjacent to them. The player starts with 300 hit points. In combat, each monster has a hit point value. Using the same number of hit points as the monster gives a 50% chance of winning the battle. Using 200% gives a 100% chance of winning the battle. After each combat, the player recovers hit points based upon the amount used, with a higher risk of failure leading to greater hit point recovery. The player only gains more hit points than they started with if there is a risk of losing combat. If the player uses less than 150% hit points and is defeated, they are killed, and the game is over. Any time outside of combat, the player can convert their score to hit points. 10% of the score can be converted each time, with a conversion of 1:1 of the first conversion, 1:2 on the second, and so forth.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "March 1, 1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "CLOAD Magazine", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/166012-adventure-dungeon\n"}
