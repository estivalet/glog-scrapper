{"altername_name": ["Star Quest I - The Escape"], "name": "Starquest", "overview": "Exploring a radioactive planet in the Betelgeuse sector, long desolate after the self-destruction of a legendary warlike race, you come upon a passageway leading underground. Much to your dismay, you discover that the aliens did not entirely self-destruct and that they are belligerent. Your escape is closed off; the only way to escape and warn Earth is to destroy the alien ships, find the hidden translocator, and zap to\u2026 another alien warbase. Each maze-like warbase is protected by squads of three or four different alien ships with different capabilities. The Fighters just shoot at you, where the Annihilators, for instance, drop a ticking mine canister which wipes out the entire warbase. The translocator doesn't appear until you've destroyed the guards, and if you take too long with that, the Vexers arrive, making a beeline for your ship, walls notwithstanding. You are far from helpless, however. Your ship can shoot in four directions and comes equipped with hyperdrive units, which are partially replenished by each translocator you nab. Hyperdrive zaps you to a random location in the warbase, a big help when Chasers are zeroing in on you. You can generate an antimatter field, too; that destroys all the walls, another life-saver when you're racing to the translocator with Vexers hot on your tail. As you might expect, bonus ships are granted at point thresholds, and the warbases go on and on.", "platform": "Tandy TRS-80", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Eric Quintana", "publishers": "Tandy Corporation", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/317599-starquest\n"}
