{"altername_name": ["\u30e2\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc"], "name": "Moto Roader", "overview": "Moto Roader is a futuristic racing game that allows up to five players to compete against each other. Players use the cash earned when they win a race to power up their machine. Not only can they change the \"tire\" and \"body\" of their vehicles, but they also can add \"special\" parts. Jump over tall obstacles with a \"hopper\" and blast past rivals at incredible speeds with \"nitro.\" What multiplayer game would be complete without attack items? Use a forward-launching \"grenade\" or a backward-dropping \"bomber\" to blow up and knock away rivals. Outmaneuver rivals in all eight heats to become the champion.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "February 23, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "NCS", "publishers": "NCS", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "5", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.75", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moto_Roader", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhhS1I7F4KA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/7905\n"}
