{"altername_name": ["Hana Taaka Daka!?"], "name": "Long Nosed Goblin", "overview": "Surely the PC Engine has to be one of the top systems for shoot em up fans. It covers all the bases, vertical, horizontal, cute ones, space ones, and wacky ones. Long Nosed Goblin or Hana Taka Daka to give it the Japanese name, certainly falls in the last camp. Not unlike Parodius it has you shooting all manner of crazy crap. You play a Long Nosed Goblin (funny that), who has to blast his way through various levels collecting power ups along the way to boss fights. Nothing that hasnt been done before in a shoot em up, but the colourful graphics and japanese art style make it a joy to play anyway.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Taito", "publishers": "Taito", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.12", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIB6FEa3RTI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/159169\n"}
