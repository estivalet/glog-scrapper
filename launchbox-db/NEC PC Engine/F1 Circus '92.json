It is officially licensed by the distributors of Formula One in Japan, and also has the rights to use the real names of teams/drivers. The game again focuses on top-down races that move at great speed and require a lot of memorization and careful driving. The player can easily be forced to retire from the race early if they take too much damage from collisions with the walls or other drivers. There's a strong customization element as well, and the player can choose to play a Special mode that includes dialogue with NPCs between races.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "December 18, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nihon Bussan", "publishers": "Nihon Bussan", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/17834\n"}
