It is the second game in the series to feature the Super moniker, given to the 16-bit iterations of the series (even if this version also was ported to the Game Boy). Each player plays a real estate corporation with the aim to earn as much money from property as possible while avoiding visiting other players property. The game can be played with 5 players with computers filling any missing spots, in a turn-based fashion. Each player starts a turn by either rolling a dice or using a card picked up during the game.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "December 20, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hudson Soft", "publishers": "Hudson Soft", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "5", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.14", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH5DsN9nLck", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/29137\n"}
