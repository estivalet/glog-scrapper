The player takes control of powerful mecha-suit called the Argyderos piloted by the female fighter Minty Geile. She starts her journey armed with a traditional Vulcan gun but numerous weapons can be collected throughout the game. The Argyderos can also later equip a back booster allowing it to fly around the environment or dash forward at high speed. Levels in Eternal City are vast maze-like areas with dead-ends and misleading corridors, each culminating with a boss battle.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "April 12, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "NAXAT Soft", "publishers": "Naxat Soft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3mr9LZK60Q", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/17858\n"}
