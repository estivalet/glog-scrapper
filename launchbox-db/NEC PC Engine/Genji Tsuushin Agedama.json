The game is based on the anime of the same name, which was actually a goofy lampoon of tokusatsu TV shows not unlike Samurai Pizza Cats and other animated superhero shows with that sensibility.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "December 13, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Interchannel, Ltd.", "publishers": "NEC Home Electronics, Ltd.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.76", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/24133\n"}
