Players move around several platforms collecting gold. Various enemies inhabit the levels, and the player, armed with a drill, attempts to drill holes to capture the enemies. Unfortunately, this does not defeat the enemies, only disables them for a short time. After a few seconds, the enemies respawn and resume their chase of the player. The five-player option was new to any incarnation of Lode Runner, and operates in a very similar manner to Bomberman, except with hole drilling instead of bombing.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "February 10, 1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hudson Soft", "publishers": "Hudson Soft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "5", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.43", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_Lode_Runner", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/l6QmI-aKFPo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/19623\n"}
