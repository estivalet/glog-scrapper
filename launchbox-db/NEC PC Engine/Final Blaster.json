As usual, the player mans a space ship, has to kill the enemy opposition and a powerful boss enemy at the end of each level. A speciality is the dynamic difficulty: if the player offers a good performance in a level, he gets ranked up which affects the difficulty of the next. There are four of those ranks. The game features two power ups which are represented with different colours: weapon upgrades and drones which accompany the player. If the player dies, the extras are evacuated into a green capsule. It can be then picked up when using the next life.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "September 28, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Aisystem Tokyo", "publishers": "Namco", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.26", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Blaster", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/17835\n"}
