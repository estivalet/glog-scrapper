Bullfight takes the conventional side view of many boxing games - you shuffle left and right tapping one button for block and another for punch, the height of which is determined by the D-pad. During the action, commentators chatter away at the bottom of the screen until one of you goes down for good. This is fairly standard stuff, although Bullfight also has an extra fighting mode to add variety. In it, you take to the streets in a Vigilante-style scrolling beat 'em up, stopping at shops to buy equipment on the way to the main fights in a proper arena.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "December 8, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Cream", "publishers": "Cream", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "8", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6QwrQ257k4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/19628\n"}
