{"altername_name": ["Terra Cresta II: Mandoraa no Gyakushuu", "Terra Cresta II: Mandrer no Gyakushuu"], "name": "Terra Cresta II: Mandoler no Gyakushuu", "overview": "Terra Cresta II: Mandler no Gyakushuu (\"Terra Cresta II: Mandler Strikes Back\"), is a vertical-scrolling shoot 'em up and the sequel to Nichibutsu's earlier Terra Cresta, which in turn was a sequel to Moon Cresta. Unlike the original, Terra Cresta II skipped the Arcade and was released on the PC Engine. The game uses a distinct power-up system where the player is acquiring additional modules for their spaceship. These modules can be configured in two ways: one configuration has them connected directly to the ship, increasing its firepower, where the second has them separate from the central ship to increase their coverage. Before starting, the player can choose which direction the ship modules will fire in and the positions they take around the central ship when separated. Through this system, the player can fine-tune the amount of coverage their bullets will reach.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "November 27, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nichibutsu", "publishers": "Nichibutsu", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.32", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maOscKaFKVM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/17846\n"}
