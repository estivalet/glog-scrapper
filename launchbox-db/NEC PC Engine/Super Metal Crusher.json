The player chooses a mech model and then distributes a set of points across various stats, including those that regulate the mech's offense, defense and AI. After this, the mech fights a randomly chosen opponent in an automated match, with the victor determined half by luck and half by the player's choices when developing their mech. After each match, the player is given a few more points to distribute on their mech's stats.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "November 29, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Make Software, Inc.", "publishers": "Pack-In-Video", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.9", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYib2W4Lxas", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/29135\n"}
