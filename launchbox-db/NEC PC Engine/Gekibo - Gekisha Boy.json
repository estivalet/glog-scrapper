{"altername_name": ["Gekisha Boy"], "name": "Gekibo: Gekisha Boy", "overview": "Gekibo: Gekisha Boy is a 2D side-scrolling game in which you play the part as a camera man who is out to snap some high paying photos to please their contractor. You control the movement of the shutter aim and you have slight control over the character as well (using the same style of control as such games as Cabal). You walk along a side-scrolling street and you have to snap unusual/tragic/funny or simply weird photos to rack up the points. It can be anything from crashing airplanes to Marilyn Monroe lookalikes and UFOs abducting cars. Every stage has a set score you need to reach to progress to the next one or you have to start it over again.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "October 2, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tomcat System", "publishers": "Irem", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.45", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gekibo:_Gekisha_Boy", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/17872\n"}
