The ball clears the net at 100 MPH and raises a little dust just inside the chalkline. An ace? no. WHOP! Your opponent returns with a powerful backhand that kills your plan of charging the net. No matter how you play - with up to 3 friends, singles, doubles, or against the computer - World Court Tennis will tax your endurance and test your skill with action that's fast and furious. Just don't scream at the line judge. He's never wrong.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "August 11, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Namco", "publishers": "NEC", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "2.55", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Tennis:_World_Court", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BO-R7zjI-oU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/7933\n"}
