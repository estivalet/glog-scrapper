Gateball", "overview": "Appare! Gateball is a virtual approximation of gateball, a lawn game inspired by croquet. The object of the game is to hit the ball through the small gates on the ground in a certain order in the least amount of hits possible. To hit the ball the shot must first be lined up and then set. Once the shot has been set then the power of the shot must also be set. To set the power the player must stop a cursor that is traveling left and right continuously.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "December 22, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Escape", "publishers": "Hudson Soft", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.78", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAt538E4hlA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/19610\n"}
