{"altername_name": [], "name": "Fighting Run", "overview": "Fighting Run is an action Mecha-based game that features an unusal mix of racing and fighting. The player takes control of a humanoid biped robot engaged in a series of deadly races against other opponents. But these races have a twist - each racer can attack the opposing player in order to win the race and score points. Each racer can freely move around the track, hit each other or use special attacks collected along the way. The game features a versus-mode where two players, or two AI controlled opponents, can race against each other, as well as a tournament-mode where eight robots and their pilots race (two at the time) for a golden trophy.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "November 29, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Nihon Bussan Co., Ltd.", "publishers": "Nihon Bussan Co., Ltd.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.79", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/56154\n"}
