{"altername_name": [], "name": "Silent Debuggers", "overview": "Make your way through a dungeon-like space station and defeat the prowling monsters in this real-time first-person shooter. You're a member of the elite Debuggers, a group of warriors who are jacks-of- all-trades. Assigned to inspect an unmanned space station, you have exactly 100 minutes to get in, destroy the monsters lurking in each block, make your way to the lowest level and deactivate the automatic detonator placed there. With each monster that slips by you, the core block becomes harder to survive in, so speed is key in preserving the facility and each separate block. Experience the thrill of survival as the timer ticks away and you uncover the truth of the events that occurred.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "March 29, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Data East", "publishers": "NEC", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.65", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Debuggers", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRF3aPF_oes", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/7916\n"}
