(natto is a regional Japanese dish) and a chef-like spy determined to stop them. Several allusions to the 007 franchise are made throughout the game, including an opening cutscene viewed from the barrel of a gun and the hero casually tossing his hat onto a hat rack as the game begins. Besides the odd narrative elements, it plays much like any Portopia-derived adventure game: The player can interact with their environment through a list of commands on the right side of the screen and the goal is to talk to NPCs, explore the surroundings and discover clues in order to solve a mystery.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "November 18, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hudson", "publishers": "Hudson Soft", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rBg39SyNQc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/71384\n"}
