{"altername_name": ["Mahjong Gakuen Mild: Touma Soujirou Toujou"], "name": "Mahjong Gakuen Mild: Touma Soushirou Toujou", "overview": "Mahjong Gakuen Mild: Touma Soushirou Toujou is a mahjong game for the PC Engine that removed the pixelated nudity from the earlier release of the game and replaced it with skimpy swimwear. When playing female opponents, winning subsequent hands of mahjong causes them to undress, similar to strip poker. The game also has male opponents which the player simply beats up instead after every successful game.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "June 29, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sankindo", "publishers": "FACE", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/70173\n"}
