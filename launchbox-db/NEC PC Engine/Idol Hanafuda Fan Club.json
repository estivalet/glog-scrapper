{"altername_name": [], "name": "Idol Hanafuda Fan Club", "overview": "Idol Hanafuda Fan Club is a strip hanafuda card game. The available variant of the game is koi-koi, the most popular form of hanafuda in Japan. Players have to assemble specific combinations by matching cards dealt to them with those displayed on the board. There is no choice of partner; the matches advance linearly, and defeat in a single round leads to Game Over. Special cards can be chosen by the player before a game begins, for certain advantages and handicaps. The ladies are represented by realistic drawings (instead of the more common anime aesthetics) and undress upon defeat.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Games Express", "publishers": "Games Express", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/58236\n"}
