{"altername_name": ["\u30a2\u30d5\u30bf\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u30ca\u30fcII"], "name": "After Burner II", "overview": "One of Sega's big arcade hits using their 'super scaler' technology, it was a bold move to try and convert this to any home machine. After Burner II is, quite simply, one of the most mindless shooters that you're ever likely to play: simply fly your F-14 into the screen, dodging missiles like crazy and letting all hell loose with your vulcan cannon. There is precious little strategy - even less than Space Harrier, and often luck plays more of a part than skill. The action is split up by the occasional bonus stage - a run through a canyon blowing up anything that dares to exist in front of you. Fuelling planes and landing strips also make a regular appearance.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "September 28, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bits Laboratory", "publishers": "NEC", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.54", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/After_Burner_II", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmKDAV12Mow", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/19607\n"}
