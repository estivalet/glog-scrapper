As well as including an \"original mode\", which plays identically to the original Arcade version and includes a hidden setting that plays the game in black and white monochrome, Fukkatsu no Hi also includes a \"Space Invaders Plus\" mode which includes more contemporary 16-bit graphics and power-ups earned from destroying UFOs. The player's ship can also take several hits before being destroyed, but generally has less cover to hide behind.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "March 2, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Taito Corporation", "publishers": "Taito Corporation", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.07", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gxK1PHxISA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/71392\n"}
