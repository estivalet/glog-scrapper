{"altername_name": ["Power League 5"], "name": "Power League 5", "overview": "Power League 5, or V, is the fifth game in Hudson's Power League series of baseball sims originally created especially for the PC Engine. The first of these games was localized in North America as World Class Baseball, which is also the alternate name for the series. It was followed by Super Power League and Power League '93, both released in 1993. The game focuses on graphical improvements and tweaking the gameplay features introduced in the previous entries. As a result, the athletes have larger sprites and have more personality - batters will often collapse in despair when striking out. When a homerun is hit, the camera dramatically pans upwards to follow the ball before switching to the standard overhead fielding view.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "August 7, 1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hudson Soft", "publishers": "Hudson Soft", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "0.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o88oZMY0CI8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/71360\n"}
