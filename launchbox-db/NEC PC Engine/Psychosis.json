Your soul has suddenly wandered into that evil world that exists in every person's heart. The only way out is to blast your way past the grotesque creatures that block your path in five \"causes\" (stages). You must face the dangers of this psychedelic world by making full use of three shot types and the satellite option. With power-ups, you can change your shots to a wide-coverage beam, a satellite-generated laser and more. Each shot type can be powered up to three levels. You can also block enemy fire by rotating the satellites to a desired position. How you use these features will be the key to successfully escaping this strange and surreal world", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "March 1, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dual", "publishers": "NEC", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.85", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosis_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu6ARUMpVdA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/7912\n"}
