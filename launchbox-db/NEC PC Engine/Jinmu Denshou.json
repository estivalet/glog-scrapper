{"altername_name": [], "name": "Jinmu Denshou", "overview": "Take control of a skilled samurai warrior as you confront all manner of evil spirits in an oriental setting. The gameplay involves running into the screen, much like Space Harrier, but with the freedom to stop and run back. But it isn't just running and slashing wildly with your sword - there are also sections where you can (or must) jump onto floating platforms as you progress (particularly stage three where contact with the water below diminishes your health. Along the way there are various statues to destroy, each leaving a present behind which gives you health or those essential shurikens that allow you to hit enemies from a distance.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "June 28, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Manjyudo", "publishers": "Big Club", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.72", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/58304\n"}
