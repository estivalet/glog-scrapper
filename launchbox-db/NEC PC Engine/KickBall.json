{"altername_name": ["\u30ad\u30c3\u30af\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb"], "name": "KickBall", "overview": "Kickball is a comedic sports game exclusively for the Japanese PC Engine. It resembles baseball, complete with a diamond of bases to around, but the \"batting\" player is actually kicking the ball. The rest of the game plays like a normal round of baseball. It features seven characters - each of which represents a team of identical athletes - each with their own special pitch/kick move. These characters also include the two protagonists from the Kaizou Choujin Shubibinman series: Tasuke and Kyapiko (or Arnold and Sonia, as they're known in Shockman). Each team also has an assigned stadium that fits their theme: the seal team, for instance, have a stadium with an ice-like floor.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "November 23, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dual", "publishers": "Masaya", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9o522mpBLRc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/34275\n"}
