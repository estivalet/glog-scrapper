This is rough and tumble, no holds barred hockey action that will challenge your stick-handling skills as well as your head-bashing abilities. While the traditional rules of hockey apply, that doesn't mean you can't throw an elbow or a high stick when the ref isn't looking. And since this is two-on-two hockey, the action is fast and furious as you try to outscore and outslug your opponent in four-player hockey action.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "September 20, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Taito Corporation", "publishers": "Taito Corporation", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "Yes", "rating": "3.41", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_the_Ice", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/7897\n"}
