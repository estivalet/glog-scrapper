The game is one-on-one - unlike actual Mahjong which is generally played with four players - due to the limitations of Mahjong simulators back in the 8-bit/16-bit era.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "June 19, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Video System", "publishers": "Video System", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.19", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaC-KBr86yc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/71405\n"}
