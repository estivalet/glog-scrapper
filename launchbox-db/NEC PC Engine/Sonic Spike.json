Blast the ball over the net -- bump, spike, dig, jump, and even quick-fake a return. Orbital lobs soar to the sun; earth-pounding spikes vibrate the ground. Score ... or eat sand! Select and create your own teams from 24 athletes pulled from six nations. Pit gals against guys in a battle of the sexes, or fight the competition of the century with Japan, Australia, Brazil, USA or USSR.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "July 27, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "IGS", "publishers": "IGS", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.95", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uOpu_n80vE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/7920\n"}
