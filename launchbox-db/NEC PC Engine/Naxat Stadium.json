It superficially models itself on Namco's Family Stadium (Famista) series of baseball sims, presenting a similar vein of comedy and super deformed athletes. The game uses fictional teams which are known only by their initial letters, and the player has some control over the configuration of their teams before starting. The game features a single-player pennant mode, a two-player competitive mode and a \"watch mode\" that allows the player to observe two CPU teams play against each other.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "October 26, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sting", "publishers": "Naxat Soft", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fANUW5Zd9pM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/70268\n"}
