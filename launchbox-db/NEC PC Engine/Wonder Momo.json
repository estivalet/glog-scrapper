In the game's storyline, Momo is a heroine from space who is fighting the evil \"Phantom Warudemon Army\" (Kaijin Gundan Warudemon\" / ?????????).", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "April 21, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Namco", "publishers": "Hudson Entertainment", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.67", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonder_Momo", "video_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonder_Momo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/71414\n"}
