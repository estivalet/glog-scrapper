{"altername_name": [], "name": "Skweek", "overview": "The goal in Skweek, similar to other puzzle games like Q*Bert, is to color in every block on the map from blue to pink. Skweek needs to avoid the various enemies on the map in order to complete his task. He can collect power-ups and point items, as well as finding shortcuts to the next level and a series of four collectible teddy bears which appear randomly around the stage. If Skweek finds all four bears, he can skip to the next stage without completing the one he is on.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "August 2, 1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Loriciel", "publishers": "Victor Entertainment", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.75", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Skweek", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sgQeZ_xXuI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/71397\n"}
