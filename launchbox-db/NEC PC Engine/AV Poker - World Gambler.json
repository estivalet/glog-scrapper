{"altername_name": [], "name": "AV Poker: World Gambler", "overview": "Unlicensed PC Engine release by Games Express. AV Poker is not a full poker simulator, but a simple gambling game. You choose from Normal, which is a standard game or Special Mode, where you travel around the world to show off your gambling skills. The poker part of the game is extremely simple. You place a bet, get a hand dealt to you, choose which cards to hold, and get a second deal to fill in the discards. If you match any of the standard poker hands, you win. You then get the options of taking the cash or playing a higher-lower game to increase your winnings significantly. Occasionally, you also get a fruit machine style mini-game which gives you the chance of winning 'special' cards that can be used during the game.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Unlicensed", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Games Express", "publishers": "Games Express", "genres": "Casino", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.11", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_wRFZWVAQw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/19615\n"}
