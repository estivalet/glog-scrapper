{"altername_name": ["R-TYPE Part 2", "R-Type Part 2"], "name": "R-Type II", "overview": "R-Type II is a side scrolling shooter and is the conversion of Irem's arcade game originally released in 1987. The Bydo Empire, a mysterious alien civilization and life form, is about to take over the Earth and the solar system. The R-9 star fighter seems to be humanity's only hope against the invasion and the small ship is sent to stop the massive threat. The fighter can use an arsenal of weapons including a standard Vulcan gun and ballistic missiles. But the real super-weapon of the ship is the force - a glowing orb made from alien technology and its basic function it to float near the R-9 and to protect it. It can however be upgraded throughout the game or charged up to fire powerful blasts of energy. Another important feature of the Force is the way how it can be shot in whatever direction it's facing - this tactic is often necessary to take down the various bosses or simply wreak havoc to the Bydo Empire. Unlike the American edition of the game, R-Type was released in Japan on two HuCards and the version tested here only includes the last four stages from the arcade game (The Den, Transport System, A City in Decay and A Star Occupied by the Bydo Empire).", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "June 3, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Irem Corp.", "publishers": "Irem Corp.", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.85", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsLzgHL9r8o", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/126935\n"}
