Instead of planting bombs, you dig holes in the ground to trap enemies then fill them in to finish them off. The game has a couple of difficulty settings, the harder providing more moving enemies to avoid or trap. There is a selection of different levels that alternate for variety (there are 60 levels in total), and the occasional boss thrown in for good measure.", "platform": "NEC TurboGrafx-16", "release_date": "October 31, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hudson Soft", "publishers": "Hudson Soft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.79", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72477\n"}
