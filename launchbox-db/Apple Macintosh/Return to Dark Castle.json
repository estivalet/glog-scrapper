{"altername_name": [], "name": "Return to Dark Castle", "overview": "In this long-awaited continuation of the Dark Castle series, you are Bryant, nephew of Prince Duncan who never returned from his quest to vanquish the evil Black Knight. There's over 50 brand new levels including all 30 classic levels from the original Dark Castle and Beyond Dark Castle combined into a brand new quest with new secret rooms and mini-games. You have to collect 25 orbs to complete the game as you go through various caves, towers, swamps, and dungeons. There's random mazes and labyrinths generated. Unlike earlier games, you can now store potions and weapons (5 of which are new) and use them when you like. There's also 4 pieces of armor that give you special strength. You can now also crawl left and right while ducking. Gameplay videos of your progress can be recorded and played back.", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "March 14, 2008", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Z Sculpt Entertainment", "publishers": "Super Happy Fun Fun", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_to_Dark_Castle", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151769-return-to-dark-castle\n"}
