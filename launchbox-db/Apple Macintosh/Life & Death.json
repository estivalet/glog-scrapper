{"altername_name": [], "name": "Life & Death", "overview": "Life & Death is a game which casts you as a doctor in a hospital. Your job is to diagnose patients and administer appropriate therapies, or even perform surgery when necessary. To diagnose a patient, you have to press on his or her abdomen, to see which portions of the stomach cause pain. Basing on this knowledge, you can choose a therapy for him (observation, medication or referring to another specialist) or administer a X-Ray or ultrasound scan to get more information about his illness. In some cases, surgery will be necessary. You're the surgeon and you have to perform the operation very carefully, adhering strictly to the procedures, preserving hygiene, and maintaining care when cutting up the patient. Should you mistakenly administer the wrong therapy, or kill your patient at the operating table, you're kicked into the medical school, where you're given hints as to what you've done wrong.", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "The Software Toolworks", "publishers": "The Software Toolworks", "genres": "Life Simulation", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_%26_Death", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/129733-life-death\n"}
