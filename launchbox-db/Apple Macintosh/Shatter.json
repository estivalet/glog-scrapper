{"altername_name": [], "name": "Shatter", "overview": "Shatter is a modern take on the video game classic Breakout. Like in the original game, the player has to bounce a ball off a bat to hit stones which break on impact. Shatter introduces a couple of new twists to the genre. The player is able to influence the ball's direction by either pushing it away from the bat or pulling it in. Some of the stones manipulate gravity and change the ball's flight path. And yet other stones explode on impact or fly away in a certain direction. There are also rotated or oddly-shaped playfields, with general Sci-Fi theme. Certain stones hold power-ups such as a manoeuvrable ball, extra lives, a stronger ball that dives through most stones without bouncing back, and more. Broken stones also release blue fragments that can be collected. These are added to a meter and when it is full, a shard storm can be unleashed. As influencing the ball's trajectory can also attack loose stones, the bat has an optional shield to protect itself. The game has different modes and not all of them are available right away. There is a story mode that follows the bat through 10 worlds. It progressively introduces new gameplay elements to the player. Each world has a boss to defeat, all of which can be fought later in the unlockable boss mode. Another mode consists of bonus rounds, where the player has to knock back balls to gain a high score. These are also played after defeating a boss mode in the story mode. The other game modes are endless, endless co-op, time attack and time attack co-op.", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "September 18, 2012", "game_type": "", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/16002-shatter\n"}
