{"altername_name": ["Nelson Tethers: Puzzle Agent"], "name": "Puzzle Agent", "overview": "In this point-and-click adventure, you play Nelson Tethers, an agent in the puzzle division of the FBI who has been sent to a small town in Minnesota, called Scoggins, to investigate the reason of why the eraser factory of the town (the one that is the sole supplier of the White House) has been shut down, since all others agents sent to the mission failed complaining about difficulty of puzzles they found when investigating the matter. In Puzzle Agent, all advancement in the plot is done by solving series of puzzles that appear in the story (and the game also offer some entirely optional ones), which are accompanied by a hint system, accessible by chewing pieces of used bubble gum (with the maximum number of three hints per puzzle), matching the non-sense stylized atmosphere of the story composed by cartoonish artwork. The puzzles are logic based, featuring usually a challenge like moving pieces through a board, solving logic problems or breaking a code.", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "April 19, 2011", "game_type": "", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/15740-puzzle-agent\n"}
