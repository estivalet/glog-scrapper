{"altername_name": [], "name": "Grim Fandango: Remastered", "overview": "Based on various legends of Mexican folklore, Grim Fandango is packed to the hilt with dancing skeletons, crime, romance, and much more. You play Manny Calavera, a mid-level worker at the Department of Death (the DOD) who's trying to work off his sins in life so that he can get to his final reward. As a reaper, Manny frees incoming souls from their shrouds, finds out what kind of underworld travel packages their goodness in life has earned them, and then sends them on their way. Unfortunately, business hasn't been very good for Manny of late. As the game begins, Calavera is told that he must sell a premium travel package to a soul or lose his job. In his search, Manny uncovers a hideous plot, a beautiful woman, and a crew of loyal friends (not necessarily in that order). Based on the acclaimed 1998 classic, this remake of Tim Schafer's original adventure title employs the stunning technology used to bring Broken Age to life for a fresh new way to experience Grim Fandango.", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "January 27, 2015", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Double Fine Productions", "publishers": "Double Fine Productions", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grim_Fandango", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRB6Likh478", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/126956-grim-fandango-remastered\n"}
