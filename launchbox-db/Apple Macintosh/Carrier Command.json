{"altername_name": [], "name": "Carrier Command", "overview": "Carrier Command is a cross between a vehicle simulation game and a real-time strategy game where players control a robotic aircraft carrier. The carrier is not based on any real-life aircraft carrier but has been designed specifically for the game. The game is set in the near future, where a team of scientists have developed two robotic aircraft carriers to colonise an archipelago of sixty-four islands. Unfortunately, the more advanced carrier falls into the hands of a terrorist organization, and they plan to conquer the archipelago for their own evil ends. It is the player's job to use the less advanced carrier to colonise the islands and destroy the enemy carrier.", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Realtime Games Software", "publishers": "Microplay Software", "genres": "Vehicle Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier_Command", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151600-carrier-command\n"}
