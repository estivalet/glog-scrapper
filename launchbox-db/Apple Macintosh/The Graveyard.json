{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Graveyard", "overview": "The Graveyard is a short game described by the authors as an explorable painting, an experiment in storytelling with real-time poetry without the use of words. It tries to evoke a feeling and tell an elaborate story with a small segment of gameplay. The player controls an elderly woman, shown from a third-person perspective. She visits a graveyard. The exploration is limited as she can only move towards a bench in front of a church. Struck by her age, she moves about slowly and needs a cane to keep her balance. She can sit down on the bench and then exit the graveyard again. Although the game elements seem limited - the camera restricts the player from entering any of the side paths - the woman's story is told through a song that starts playing when she sits down. The lyrics are in Dutch, but they are transcribed in English at the bottom of the screen. The full version of the game introduces a random time of death for the woman, not allowing the player to exit the graveyard and enhancing the drama. The game is entirely in black and white, but there are various lighting effects and birds flying around.", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "January 1, 2011", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tale of Tales", "publishers": "Tale of Tales", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIHi2z64tog", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/9983-the-graveyard\n"}
