{"altername_name": [], "name": "Maelstrom", "overview": "Maelstrom is a video game developed by Andrew Welch, released as shareware in November 1992 for Mac OS. The game is an enhanced clone of Atari, Inc.'s 1979 Asteroids arcade game with a visual style similar to the Atari Games 1987 sequel, Blasteroids. Maelstrom was released when there were few action games for the high-resolution color displays of the Macintosh, so it garnered much interest, despite the dated concept, and led to the creation of Ambrosia Software. The game was later released as free and open-source software, resulting in ports for other platforms.", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Andrew Welch", "publishers": "Ambrosia Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maelstrom_(1992_video_game)", "video_link": "https://youtu.be/stxgF2fBq9c", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/132116-maelstrom\n"}
