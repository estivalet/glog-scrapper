{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sword of Sodan", "overview": "Like S\u00f8ren Gr\u00f8nbech's other game Datastorm, Sword of Sodan was most noted on the technical side, as the sprites were large and distinctive-looking. Your task (as either a hero or heroine) is to dethrone the tyrannous Zoras the Necromancer, and avenge his killing of your father. There are 11 levels to take on, with indoor and outdoor settings. Your character has a range of sword-slashing and jumping moves, which must be used to their full effect if you are to make progress. The game features digitised sound and speech, as well as an action-replay feature, an unusual concept outside sports games at the time.", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Discovery Software International", "publishers": "Bethesda Softworks", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword_of_Sodan", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151822-sword-of-sodan\n"}
