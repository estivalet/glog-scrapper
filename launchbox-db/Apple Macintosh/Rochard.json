{"altername_name": [], "name": "Rochard", "overview": "Rochard is a side-scrolling science-fiction platformer where the player takes the titular role of John Rochard, an astrominer in search of his missing crew. With his gravity-manipulating G-Lifter device and his wits, he needs to solve tricky puzzles and dispose of space pirates and other enemies that stand in his way. During the course of the game, Rochard makes his way through various asteroids and space stations. The G-Lifter is the sole weapon in the game, and while in the beginning it only acts as a gravity gun, the player can upgrade it to fire at enemies and throw multiple kinds of grenades. The enemies consist of dim-witted humans and the in-built security systems of the facilities, such as turrets, robots and force fields.", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "December 22, 2011", "game_type": "", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/15837-rochard\n"}
