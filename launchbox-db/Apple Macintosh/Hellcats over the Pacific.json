{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hellcats over the Pacific", "overview": "Hellcats Over the Pacific is an early 1990's air combat simulator for the Macintosh platform. It features the World War II era Grumman F6F Hellcat in both land and carrier-based missions around the Solomon Islands. Combat scenarios include air-air, air-ground and air-sea missions with both guns and bombs. The player's objectives are to achieve the rank of Captain and collect awards for accomplishing the eight included missions. Hellcats, programmed by Eric Parker of Parsoft, uses special graphics routines that only redraw parts of the screen that change from frame to frame for better performance. A landmark achievement on the Mac platform, it offers fast 3D polygonal color graphics and a detailed flight model for its day.", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Parsoft Interactive", "publishers": "Graphic Simulations Corporation", "genres": "Flight Simulator", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellcats_over_the_Pacific", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/129647-hellcats-over-the-pacific\n"}
