{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Settlers II: Veni, Vidi, Vici", "overview": "Veni, Vidi, Vici is the sequel of the well-known Settlers game. You start your settlement with only one main building. To build any other buildings, you first must find a source for stones and wood. So you start to build little roads where your men transport all the different goods along. There exist more than 30 different professions your men can have, and many different building types. Of course, there are other settlers in your area, too, so war is unavoidable. Although the Macintosh port was released a fair degree of time after the MS-DOS version, it benefited immensely from a little extra tweaking.", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Similis Software", "publishers": "Blue Byte Software", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Settlers_II", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151840-the-settlers-ii-veni-vidi-vici\n"}
