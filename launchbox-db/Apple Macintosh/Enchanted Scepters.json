{"altername_name": [], "name": "Enchanted Scepters", "overview": "This is one of the few adventures created specifically for the Mac. The evil Hurks are amassing an army and only one ray of hope exists - Elron the wizard can repel the attack, but only if he possesses the four enchanted scepters, lost decades ago in the Great Wars. This, of course, is where you come in. Find the scepters and return alive! The game has over 200 scenes with interactive graphics - doors open, objects move, and so on. It also features what the publisher calls 'RealSound' - basically real digitized sound effects and not synthesized. Otherwise this is a standard text adventure game.", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Silicon Beach Software", "publishers": "Silicon Beach Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enchanted_Scepters", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/133819-enchanted-scepters\n"}
