{"altername_name": [], "name": "Super Wing Commander", "overview": "Super Wing Commander is a remake of the first Wing Commander with new graphics and sound. As in the original game, the player takes control of a young pilot on the carrier TCS Tiger's Claw to fly missions in the war against the Kilrathi. The game includes the Vega campaign from the original game and the first Secret Missions add-on campaign. Secret Missions 2 is replaced with a new campaign in which the Tiger's Claw must find and destroy the base where the Sivar dreadnought from Secret Missions 1 was developed. The look of the original game has been completely redesigned, with ships and people looking completely different from the original. All dialogue is now heard through digitized speech.", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "March 23, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "ORIGIN Systems, Inc.", "publishers": "Electronic Arts, Inc.", "genres": "Flight Simulator", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_Commander_(video_game)#Super_Wing_Commander", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxC7SdkISf8", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/105814-super-wing-commander\n"}
