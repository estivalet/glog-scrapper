{"altername_name": [], "name": "Crystal Picnic", "overview": "In Crystal Picnic, you take a zany group of friends on a quest to recover stolen crystals from crazed ants. The action takes place in real-time platform-style battles where you use your weapons and skills purchased with recovered crystals. The game has many RPG elements and we classify it as an Action RPG. Though short, it provides a funny story with lots to see. If Greenlit, we would add some Steam Achievements to the game. The game is playable in English, French and German now. Other translations are not currently planned but if we can line up experienced translators that could potentially change in the future. We'll try our best to honour past purchases with Steam keys, though it may not always be possible.", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "", "game_type": "", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Nooskewl", "publishers": "Nooskewl", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/31633-crystal-picnic\n"}
