You'll visit local businesses in town - the Treasure Chest store, the Museum, the Duck Pond Inn, the Boat Shop and the Ice Cream Store, as well as the train station, a lighthouse, an island, and more. As you solve puzzles, you learn more about the pirate history of Smuggler's Cove, and with every riddle area you solve you'll discover a torn piece of a treasure map. As you collect pieces, you can click on a wax-sealed paper icon in the top right of your screen - here you'll click and drag the ripped pieces to fit them together into a map for a treasure hunt.", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Black Hammer Productions", "publishers": "Scholastic", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151676-i-spy-treasure-hunt\n"}
