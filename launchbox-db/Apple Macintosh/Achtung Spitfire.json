{"altername_name": [], "name": "Achtung Spitfire", "overview": "Achtung Spitfire is the sequel to Over the Reich. It is a turn based Strategy/Simulation game which covers aviation history from 1939 to 1945 and includes the R.A.F., the Luftwaffe, and the French Armee de l'Air and has different campaigns for each air force. The game shares the same interface and flight engine of its predecessor, so anyone that has played Over the Reich is familiarized with this game. The game itself consists of commanding a series of pilots which you can manage to achieve the mission goal. It also regards the technical evolutions during the war, which means you have different types of planes at your disposal as the game progresses. After you have chosen the right pilots it's time to intercept, attack enemies or defend your own allies. The game is turn based but you have limited autonomy each time you play according to your plane's speed and torque.", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "1997", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Big Time Software", "publishers": "The Avalon Hill Game Company", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achtung_Spitfire!", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151918-achtung-spitfire\n"}
