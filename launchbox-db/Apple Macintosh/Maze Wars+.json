{"altername_name": [], "name": "Maze Wars+", "overview": "This is a version of the very first 3D first-person shooter ever made around 1973 on the Imlacs PDS-1 mainframe computer at the NASA Ames Research Center in California and later on the M.I.T. and Xerox PARC networks. It was the first real-time multi-player game on the AppleTalk network where 30 (but optimally 4-6) players could duel it out. Two players could also play over a modem. You could play as one of four different robot types in 4 different mazes. You could view the the path of the maze and its branching paths and any other player characters encountered in first-person as well as top-down view. You could fire missiles at other players and use teleporters to move instantly to another part of the maze.", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "MacroMind", "publishers": "MacroMind", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_War#Other_versions", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151714-maze-wars\n"}
