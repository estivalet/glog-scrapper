{"altername_name": [], "name": "Flight Commander", "overview": "This tactical wargame / simulation attempts to visualize air-to-air dogfights using a \"board game\" style. Your job is to take command of a squadron of planes seen on an overhead map and try to outmaneuver enemy pilots, sometimes you're also required to conduct air strikes. As the period covered in included scenarios is post-WW2 jet age, combat focuses on guided missiles, but planes may also engage using guns, while ground targets can be attacked as well with bombs. The turn-based gameplay may be tweaked to preferred difficulty level (stalls are more forgiving, target acquisition is easier, etc.).", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Big Time Software", "publishers": "Big Time Software", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/158522-flight-commander\n"}
