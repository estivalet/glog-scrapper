As a contestant, the player's mission is to be the first to ever complete it successfully. The task involves commanding a fleet of Skimmers charged with destroying various groups of combat vehicles, including Cycloids, Scouts and Defenders. Short and long-range scanners are available to aid in this. The game takes place in a maze world containing a number of distinct sectors, each of which has its own type of enemy present.
