{"altername_name": ["Solid State Pinball: Jinni Zeala"], "name": "Jinni Zeala Pinball", "overview": "Jinni Zeala is another pinball simulator by LittleWing. The game has one table with a \"1001 Nights\" middle-eastern theme. The goal is to activate several bonus stages, represented in the table as models with three drop targets (with the exception of Felucca and Zeala stages) and a sink hole each. There are five stages: Oasis, Cave, Zeala, Palace and Felucca Boat. To activate most of them, the player has to acquire four items, each collected by dropping the three targets and sinking the ball in the hole. The Felucca and Zeala stages don't have targets, instead the player has to shoot the ball through the lanes.", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "2002", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "LittleWing", "publishers": "MacPlay", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151680-jinni-zeala-pinball\n"}
