{"altername_name": [], "name": "Nancy Drew: The Captive Curse", "overview": "According to local legend, a mysterious creature emerged from the forest near Castle Finster long ago, snatched a girl wearing a jeweled necklace, and then disappeared. Now noises in the woods have everyone alarmed in fear that the creature has returned. The castle's owner hires Nancy Drew, the famous teen-aged detective, to travel to Germany and use her sleuthing skills to uncover the truth. Nancy Drew: The Captive Curse is an adventure game played using a first-person perspective. The game features two difficulty levels (Junior or Senior Detective) and a \"Second Chance\" restore option. Walking in the shoes of Nancy Drew, players explore the expansive Bavarian castle and the nearby woodlands, talking to other characters, searching for clues and solving puzzles. Nancy's cell phone has been upgraded to a \"smart phone\" allowing players to take pictures of evidence in addition to making calls, messaging, getting in-game hints, and playing mini-games. Also new to this game is coin and medallion collection and the ability to earn reward badges for doing certain things.", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "June 28, 2011", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Her Interactive", "publishers": "Her Interactive", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/110718-nancy-drew-the-captive-curse\n"}
