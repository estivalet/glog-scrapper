{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mighty Math: Calculating Crew", "overview": "This game, hosted by four superheroes, offers a choice of four game areas set in a hi-tech futuristic city. Within each area there are a wide array of choices of both topics and levels of play. In the geometry area, a woman guide presents many variations on the task of matching 3D geometric solids to their 2D nets. In another area, a male host uses the concept of arrays to guide the player through multi-digit division and multiplication problems. The third area asks you to retrieve treasures by navigating a number line (by entering whole or rational numbers, adding, subtracting, multiplying or dividing). In the fourth area, the player can use an allotted amount of money to shop for variously priced objects. In two of the four areas you have the choice of a design task. In the geometry area, you can decorate different faces of a 3D solid and manipulate the solid in space. In the number line area, you can create a treasure hunt for yourself.", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Edmark", "publishers": "Edmark", "genres": "", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "http://macintoshgarden.org/games/mighty-math-calculating-crew", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJoSTUSWB7U", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78052-mighty-math-calculating-crew\n"}
