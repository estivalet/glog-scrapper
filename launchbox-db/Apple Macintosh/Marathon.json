{"altername_name": ["Marathon 1"], "name": "Marathon", "overview": "A security guard was accompanying a group of space colonists on their trip on the huge space ship, the Marathon. Suddenly, aliens of the Pfhor race attack the ship and massacre the colonists. What's worse, the aliens damage the omniscient super-computers on Marathon. One of them is heavily damaged, and the other becomes insane. Caught in the midst of the battle between the two AIs, trying to stay alive in the onslaught of the Pfhor, the protagonist begins a desperate fight for survival. Marathon is a first-person shooter, notable for pioneering the \"free look\" feature (moving the camera in all directions with the mouse). There is a variety of weapons that serve the hero in battle. Different types of enemies (organic or mechanical) take different amounts of damage depending on the weapon. The protagonist is also able to fire from two weapons (such as pistols) simultaneously. Shooting enemies is not the only thing to do in the game; it is possible to communicate with the damaged AIs of the ship by looking at messages they send you via computers. The story is unraveled primarily through those messages.", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "December 21, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Bungie Software Products", "publishers": "Bungie Software Products", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/129668-marathon\n"}
