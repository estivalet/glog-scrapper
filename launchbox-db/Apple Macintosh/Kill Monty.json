{"altername_name": [], "name": "Kill Monty", "overview": "Kill Monty is a top-down shooter in which the player controls the Freeverse mascot Jen. The object of the game is to destroy anything and everything. Each level is based around a game/movie theme and has its own boss at the end of each wave who goes along with that theme. There is no end to the game, instead the player will find himself fighting wave after wave of zombie monkeys and evil playing cards, among other enemies. The game does feature multiplayer modes such as New Game (Standard mode), Survival, and Assault, although they are pretty similar.", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "March 15, 2005", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "Freeverse", "publishers": "Freeverse", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/372970-kill-monty\n"}
