{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ultima II: The Revenge of The Enchantress", "overview": "Ultima II: The Revenge of the Enchantress, released on August 24, 1982 and in 1985 for the Macintosh, is the second role-playing video game in the Ultima series. It was also the only official Ultima game published by Sierra On-Line. Controversy with Sierra over royalties for the PC port of this game led the series creator Richard Garriott to start his own company, Origin Systems. The gameplay is very similar to the previous game in the series, Ultima. The scope of the game is bigger, in that there are several more places to explore, even though some of them (like most of the solar system planets and the dungeons and towers) are optional and not required to complete the game. In the game, the player has to travel to several different time periods of Earth, using time doors. The periods are the Time of Legends (a mythological period), Pangea (about 300 to 250 million years ago), B.C. (1423, \"before the dawn of civilization\"), A.D. (1990), and the Aftermath (after 2112).", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Richard Garriott", "publishers": "Sierra On-Line", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima_II:_The_Revenge_of_the_Enchantress", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/127304-ultima-ii-the-revenge-of-the-enchantress\n"}
