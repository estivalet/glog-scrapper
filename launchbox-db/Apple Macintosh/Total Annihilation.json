{"altername_name": [], "name": "Total Annihilation", "overview": "Total Annihilation is a real-time strategy video game created by Cavedog Entertainment, a sub-division of Humongous Entertainment, and released on September 30, 1997 by GT Interactive for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS.[3] It was the first real-time strategy game to feature 3D units and terrain. Two expansion packs were released, The Core Contingency on April 30, 1998[5] and Battle Tactics on June 30, 1998.[6] After the closure of the Cavedog Entertainment Studios in 1999, the intellectual property fell to Infogrames (now Atari). Total Annihilation is no longer officially supported, due to the closure of Cavedog. The Cavedog team ended, but ex-Cavedog and lead designer Chris Taylor, went on with Gas Powered Games to create Supreme Commander in 2007, popularly considered the \"spiritual successor\" of Total Annihilation.[7] The creators of XTA, a mod for Total Annihilation, independently developed the open source 3D graphics Spring game engine.[8] The Total Annihilation 3D project was begun in the summer of 2006.[9] Other ex-members of Cavedog, including Total Annihilation\u200a's game engine developer Jon Mavor, later went on to develop Planetary Annihilation in 2014, another game in the same vein as Total Annihilation. In July, 2013, Wargaming.net bought the Total Annihilation franchise from the Atari bankruptcy proceedings.[10]", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "January 1, 1997", "game_type": "", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/8707-total-annihilation\n"}
