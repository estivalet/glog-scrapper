{"altername_name": [], "name": "Spectre", "overview": "Spectre is a 3D shooter where the player drives a little red car/tank and blasts away enemies. The gameplay is similar to Battlezone, and obviously inspired by it. The goal of the game is to drive the tank around the playfield, collecting ten flags by driving over them, while avoiding obstacles (including rotating windmills) and the shots of computer-generated enemy tanks.", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Velocity", "publishers": "Peninsula Gameworks", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "8", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectre_(1991_video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151508-spectre\n"}
