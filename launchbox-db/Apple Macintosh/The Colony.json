{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Colony", "overview": "Patrolling around in your DAS Armoured Cruiser, your attempts to catch forty winks are interrupted by the radio crackling to life. The last message from this settlement \u2013 received some hours ago \u2013 was broadcast by their commander who, before being cut off, ranted on about being overrun. The ensuing silence from the Plot calls for investigation, and as you\u2019re in the vicinity. The Colony is a 3-D walkabout adventure where, using a mouse/keys combination, you explore and react with firstly your own ship, then the planet\u2019s surface and ultimately the Settlement complex. Viewed in first-person perspective, locations are displayed in a basic line-drawing style which may be filled in or not, depending on how fast you want screens to update.", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "David Alan Smith", "publishers": "Mindscape", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Colony_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/102655-the-colony\n"}
