You can play as a black or a white guy, a cartoonish character or a kangaroo (!). Three play modes exist: Completely interactive: You control your fighter's every move Coaching: You tell your fighter how to fight (aggressive, jabbing, defensive, etc.) in between rounds Completely simulated: The computer does all the fighting Stats are input in text variables, allowing you to not only customize your boxer very specifically (reach, height, weight, etc.) but also recreate some of history's best fighters and pit them together in a simulation.
