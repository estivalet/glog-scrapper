{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Seven Colors: Legend of PSY\u30fbS City", "overview": "A careless angel flying high above PSY\u30fbS City accidentally drops seven special hearts that govern the night. When the purple heart flutters through the window and lands in the player's living room, they set out to find the other six and restore them to heaven. The Seven Colors is a first-person multimedia point-and-click adventure game. The ultimate goal of finding the hearts is more or less just a framing device giving the players a reason to explore, but travelling through the city to see what it has to offer is very much its own reward. The environment is full of neat sights and weird things to discover, all set to music by band PSY\u30fbS and one of its members, Masaya Matsuura. This was the first game designed by Matsuura, coming several years before his work on Tunin' Glue and Parappa the Rapper. Matsuura had previously worked on the soundtrack to Metamor Jupiter with PSY\u30fbS bandmate Mami Yasunori.", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Virtual East", "publishers": "Sony Music Entertainment", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151920-the-seven-colors-legend-of-psys-city\n"}
