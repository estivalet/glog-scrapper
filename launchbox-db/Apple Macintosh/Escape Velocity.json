{"altername_name": [], "name": "Escape Velocity", "overview": "Escape Velocity is an open-ended, role-playing arcade game set in a future where interstellar space travel has allowed mankind to expand its reach to countless unique solar-systems. The game is presented from a top-down, slightly isometric-view in which players control a pilot of one of the many space vessels the game has to offer. Traveling between the various different star-systems in the game is done through hyperspace travel, whereas sub-space travel is used for manual maneuvers, such as landing/docking and space combat. The main plot in EV revolves around a dispute between two rival groups, the \"Confederation\" and the \"Rebellion\". Depending on the player's actions throughout the game, the two factions may or may not be affected at all. It is completely up to the player as to whether or not to assist either of them.", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "May 5, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Ambrosia Software", "publishers": "Ambrosia Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/123409-escape-velocity\n"}
