{"altername_name": [], "name": "DiRT 4", "overview": "Dirt 4 is a racing video game focused on rallying. Players compete in timed stage events on tarmac and off-road terrain in varying weather conditions. Rally stages span five locations: Fitzroy in Australia, Tarragona in Spain, Michigan in the United States, V\u00e4rmland in Sweden and Powys in Wales. Cars are drawn from a wide variety of competition classes and time periods, such as the Group B cars of the 1980s, Group A and Group N cars from the 1990s and 2000s, and Group R cars from the 2010s. The game will not feature World Rally Cars or any elements associated with the World Rally Championship. Dirt 4 also introduces a new feature called \"Your Stage\" that procedurally generates rally stages based on a setting and parameters that the player defines. As the game does not feature any licensed content for its rally mode, Your Stage will be used to generate all of the stages that the player drives on in career mode.", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "March 28, 2019", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Codemasters", "publishers": "Codemasters", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "8", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirt_4", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCgQzElkJsE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/127036-dirt-4\n"}
