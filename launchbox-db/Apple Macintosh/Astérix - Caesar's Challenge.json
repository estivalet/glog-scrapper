{"altername_name": ["Ast\u00e9rix: Le d\u00e9fi de C\u00e9sar"], "name": "Ast\u00e9rix: Caesar's Challenge", "overview": "This interactive board game offers action and adventure as Asterix and his friends journey around the Roman Empire on a challenge from Caesar while learning about different countries' history and culture. You can play as various characters including Asterix, Obelix, Impedimenta, Panacea, Justforkix and Geriatrix. You have to collect souvenirs from various places as proof you've been there, and then get back to your village in time or else Caesar will win. It allows for up to 4 players or you can play against the computer. The game track has 54 squares that can be landed on which represent countries, challenges, prisons, magic potions, traps, rest, and meeting character opportunities. The druid Getafix is host and will hand out magic potion flasks to players (except Obelix who, as fans of the comics know, fell into a potion when he was very young). You can acquire some interesting gadgets from the druid-spy Dubbelosix, that will help you move more quickly. To win the recquired souvenir items, you have to either answer the questions asked in the country squares or buy them from the Phoenician merchant Ekonomikrisis with sestertii won in challenge squares. The scoundrel Tortuous Convolvulus will also try to impede the players progress, so look out.", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Infogrames", "publishers": "Philips Interactive Media", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151930-asterix-caesars-challenge\n"}
