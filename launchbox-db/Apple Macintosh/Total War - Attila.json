It is the ninth standalone game in the Total War series of video games. The game begins in 395 AD, during the transition from Late Antiquity to the early Dark Ages. While the title character will be able to become the leader of the Huns, he is not yet in power at the start of the campaign. Due to its setting near the Dark Ages, the game is possibly a spiritual successor to Rome: Total War: Barbarian Invasion.", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "February 1, 2015", "game_type": "", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/24971-total-war-attila\n"}
