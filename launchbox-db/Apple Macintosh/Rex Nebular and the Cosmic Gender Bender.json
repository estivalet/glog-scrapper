{"altername_name": [], "name": "Rex Nebular and the Cosmic Gender Bender", "overview": "The interstellar pilot and Casanova-wannabe Rex Nebular is hired by Colonel Stone for a hefty sum to travel to a distant planet and retrieve a vase that supposedly holds great sentimental value to him. On the way Rex's ship is attacked, and he crash-lands on a mysterious planet. Further inspection reveals that this planet is inhabited solely by women; in a terrible war between sexes, the female population annihilated the male one with biological weapons, and is now artificially procreating with a device called the Gender Bender. Rex is soon captured by the planet's cruel elite forces, and must find a way to escape while preserving his virility. Rex Nebular and the Cosmic Gender Bender is a puzzle-solving adventure game with light erotic and comedy elements, somewhat influenced by Leisure Suit Larry and Space Quest series. The interface resembles the one used in most LucasArts games of the time period: the player chooses verbs from a menu at the bottom on the screen, interacting with objects on screen. Most of the puzzles are inventory-based. Three difficulty levels are available.", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "MPS Labs", "publishers": "MicroProse Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_Nebular_and_the_Cosmic_Gender_Bender", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151772-rex-nebular-and-the-cosmic-gender-bender\n"}
