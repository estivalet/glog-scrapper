Tells the story of the Fool, who wanders throughout the land solving puzzles to break the enchantments, discover the land's treasures, and undo evil. Features word searches, cryptograms, jigsaw puzzles, anagrams, a Tarot-based card game, and lots of other bizarre puzzles. Also includes an animated intro, and extended finale animation as separate executables (but you have to win before it'll let you run the finale).", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Cliff Johnson", "publishers": "Miles Computing", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fool%27s_Errand", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/30355-the-fools-errand\n"}
