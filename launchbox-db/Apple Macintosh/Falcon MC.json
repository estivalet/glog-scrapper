{"altername_name": [], "name": "Falcon MC", "overview": "This is the follow-up to version 2 of the original Falcon F-16 Flight Simulator, being roughly equivalent to Falcon 3.0 for PC; it was followed years later by Falcon 4.0. The game's focus is on simulating combat between your F-16 and enemy MiG-29s, SAMs, and ground targets, utilizing both fire-and-forget and guided missiles and bombs. Features include 3-D graphics (in 16-color mode only) and digitized radio speech. Detail and difficulty level can be adjusted according to taste and head-to-head network play with another computer is supported. For those with little patience, an \"Instant Action\" arcade-style dogfighting mode is offered on the main menu.", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Spectrum Holobyte", "publishers": "Spectrum Holobyte", "genres": "Flight Simulator", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151630-falcon-mc\n"}
