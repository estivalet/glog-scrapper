{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sub Battle Simulator (1994)", "overview": "This is the color remake of Sub Battle Commander, a popular Submarine Battle Simulator for the Macintosh. Part of its success was thanks to the fact that the popular GATO broke with the release of System 6, leaving the Mac submarine commanders all alone in their ports. The game allows you to play either single missions or a wartime command on the American or German side. The game features a day & night cycle, different weather conditions, auto-navigation, a variety of sea and air vessels and a time-compression feature.", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Digital Illusions", "publishers": "Alliance Interactive Software", "genres": "Vehicle Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151819-sub-battle-simulator-1994\n"}
