{"altername_name": [], "name": "Creepy Castle", "overview": "Creepy Castle is a horror fighting game where the player controls a character who has to rescue a girl who has been kidnapped by a scientist. There are four locations to choose from: the woods, the graveyard, the castle, and the dungeon. The game is entirely in black and white. The character has three lives and each location is based on the same concept. Travel from screen to screen, while fighting the location's basic monsters until you meet a boss character. Actions include punches, kicks and throws. Each level also has a flying enemy. When it is killed, it drops a talisman that destroy everything on the screen. There are also other weapons to use, such as knives, stakes, rocks, an axe, a gun with silver bullets and more. To unlock powers or weapons, enemies sometimes need to be defeated with a specific action. There is always a special weapon that can be used against the boss, and food restores health. Some of the enemies are werewolves, raven, ghouls, buzzards, spiders, skeletons, vampires and bats. To beat the scientist in the dungeon level, the previous bosses need to be defeated first. All three of them leave behind a special power (strength, accuracy, and agility), and the combination of them is needed to take on the final boss.", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Reactor", "publishers": "Reactor", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151616-creepy-castle\n"}
