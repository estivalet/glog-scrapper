{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mouse Stampede", "overview": "Mouse Stampede is a Centipede variant where the centipede has been replaced by a pack of mice. The player controls his gun (which happens to look like a Mac mouse) freely around the lower sections of the screen while shooting at the pack of mice that moves down the screen one line at a time. The screen is also full of cheese that acts as obstacles affecting the mice's route. When a mouse is hit it oddly enough turns into cheese. There are also sleeping cats that when hit are awoken and start eating mice that are close. Various other enemies exist in the game including bats, stomping sneakers, knives, flies, paint brushes, turtles and falling shopping carts. The player has three lives and loses one when being touched by any of the enemies. An extra life is earned when reaching 15,000 points.", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mark of the unicorn", "publishers": "Mark of the unicorn", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/145560-mouse-stampede\n"}
