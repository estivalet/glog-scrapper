{"altername_name": [], "name": "Knights and Merchants: The Shattered Kingdom", "overview": "Knights & Merchants is a game very similar to Settlers II, and that's not really a coincidence, as they were made by the same lead programmer, who started his own company (Joymania). In K&M you start building a base and gain resources, and after that you make an army and try to attack the enemy. It's a mix between a godsim and a RTS game. The game features resolutions up to 1024x768 with high-detail landscapes in 3D, with 2D-bitmap buildings placed upon it.", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "2001", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "Joymania Entertainment", "publishers": "e.p.i.c. interactive", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_and_Merchants:_The_Shattered_Kingdom", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151684-knights-and-merchants-the-shattered-kingdom\n"}
