{"altername_name": [], "name": "Chocolatier 2: Secret Ingredients", "overview": "Several years ago, you helped Evangeline Baumeister to save her family's chocolate business. Now, it is the 1920's but the Baumeisters have not kept up with innovations and the business is in dire straights again. Help Alexandra Tangye, Evangeline's granddaughter, update and recover the family business. As in the first Chocolatier, you will run a chocolate factory business. This time, in addition to chocolate squares, you can make sauces, truffles, pralines and more. Travel the globe looking for ingredients and recipes. Be sure to buy at the best rates you can to stretch every dollar. Once you have your ingredients, head to the factory to mix up some chocolate. This is done in a mini-game where you launch the ingredients towards the correct compartments on the machine. Do this as quickly and accurately as you can to get your output levels high. Later recipes will be more complex, making this task harder. Once the chocolate is made, it is time to sell it for a profit. As the game progresses, you can also buy other factories to increase your production and profits.", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "November 20, 2007", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "Big Splash Games", "publishers": "PlayFirst", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chocolatier_2:_Secret_Ingredients", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151607-chocolatier-2-secret-ingredients\n"}
