{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hoyle Classic Card Games", "overview": "The fourth (comparatively little-known) installment in Sierra On-Line's Hoyle series offers a collection of eight popular card games: Bridge, Euchre, Old Maid, Gin Rummy, Hearts, Cribbage, Crazy Eights, and Klondike. In addition to reading the basic rules for each individual game, players can now access an interface tutorial and a glossary of game-specific terms, as well as customize a range of options. Hoyle Classic Card Games is apparently the last volume in the series to feature animated characters from other Sierra titles.", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sierra On-Line", "publishers": "Sierra On-Line", "genres": "Casino", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoyle%27s_Official_Book_of_Games#Hoyle_Classic_Card_Games_(Hoyle_4)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151529-hoyle-classic-card-games\n"}
