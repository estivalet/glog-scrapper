{"altername_name": ["Falcon: The F-16 Flight Simulator"], "name": "Falcon", "overview": "The long Falcon simulation legacy of hardcore simulations of the F-16 fighter plane begins here. The plane's electronic displays and radars are simulated fully, with 4 styles of HUD. Not only can your plane barrel-roll and scissor, the enemy planes can too, with Artificial Intelligence recreating the moves of a real pilot. This was one of the earliest games to offer head-to-head play by linking two machines. It comes with a massive manual, detailing all those functions.", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Sphere", "publishers": "Spectrum Holobyte", "genres": "Flight Simulator", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/129662-falcon\n"}
