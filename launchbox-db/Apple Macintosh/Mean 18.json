{"altername_name": ["Mean 18 Ultimate Golf"], "name": "Mean 18", "overview": "Mean 18 is notable for two reasons: it was the first computer golf game to give the golfer's point of view of the course, and it was the first golf game to come with a course editor that allowed players to create their own courses. Mean 18 featured the Augusta National and Pebble Beach and St. Andrews courses. It used the soon popular 3-click control system, whereby the first click starts the swing, the second sets the power, and the third sets draw or fade. The game features Beginner and Expert difficulty options. The Expert mode has more pronounced draw and fade effects, making the timing of the third click more crucial. The player can also choose between regular and professional tees. For the regular mode, the tees are shorter and the computer automatically recommends the best club. Using the professional tees, the computer still recommends clubs, but not necessarily the best ones for the shot.", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "December 1, 1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Microsmiths", "publishers": "Accolade", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_18", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151891-mean-18\n"}
