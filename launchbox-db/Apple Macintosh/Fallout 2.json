When the First Vault Dweller was forced from his home, he walked north until he found some new friends and founded a tribe in a suitable place. But some years after his death, the tribe is dying. The Elders decide that one of the tribe members, the \"Chosen One\", must find the salvation, a universal tool called G.E.C.K. (short for \"Garden of Eden Creation Kit\"). Sadly, the hero's only clue are the ancient disks the Vault Dweller has left, and the only equipment are his clothes and PipBoy. With courage and determination the proclaimed Chosen One leaves to save his village, unaware of the consequences his actions will carry.", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "July 31, 2002", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "M - Mature", "developers": "Black Isle Studios", "publishers": "MacPlay", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.67", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_2", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151888-fallout-2\n"}
