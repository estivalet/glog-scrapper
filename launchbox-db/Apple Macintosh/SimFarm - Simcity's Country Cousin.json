{"altername_name": ["SimFarm"], "name": "SimFarm: Simcity's Country Cousin", "overview": "SimFarm: SimCity's Country Cousin, developed by Maxis in 1993, is a computer game in which players build and manage a virtual farm. It was released in 1993 as a spin-off of SimCity. Mirroring duties on a real farm, SimFarm puts players in charge of building up the land, placing the buildings, buying and selling livestock and planting crops. A weather and season system are in place as well, presenting the same kind of challenges found in a real-world farm. As with SimCity, there are disasters that can wreak havoc on the player's farm. Tornadoes, droughts, pests, and dust storms are some of the events that can disrupt farm crops and harvests. SimFarm also has a small town included in its simulation. This town is reminiscent of SimCity in its form and function. The player may interact with the town occasionally by suggesting new tile types and joining competitions with livestock (such as sending in a prize pig to potentially earn a blue ribbon and a cash prize.) Suggesting an airport to be built in the town will usually cause its construction, thus unlocking the ability to buy and use a crop duster", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "1993", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Maxis", "publishers": "Maxis", "genres": "Life Simulation", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimFarm", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/92848-simfarm-simcitys-country-cousin\n"}
