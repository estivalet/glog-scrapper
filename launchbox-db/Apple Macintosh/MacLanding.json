{"altername_name": [], "name": "MacLanding", "overview": "MacLanding is a clone of the Williams arcade classic Defender. The player controls a space fighter that is flying over a jagged planetary landscape on a mission to protect humanoids from the aliens. The player patrols the two-way scrolling landscape in his ship, disposing of aliens preventing them from abducting the humanoids. If the aliens manage to get a humanoid to outer space (top of the screen), it mutates and chases you down. You can rescue the humanoid by shooting the alien capturing it, but if it falls too far it will fall to its death. To avoid that your craft needs to swoop in to pick it up and return it safely to the surface. At the end of level, each surviving humanoid gives you a bonus score. Your ship is equipped with lasers and a limited number of smart bombs and the the top of the screen is dedicated to a long range scanner that shows the location of all enemies and humanoids on the level.", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Avadis Tevarian Jr.", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/371342-maclanding\n"}
