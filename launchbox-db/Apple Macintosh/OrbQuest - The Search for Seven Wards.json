{"altername_name": [], "name": "OrbQuest: The Search for Seven Wards", "overview": "OrbQuest is an adventure/fantasy role-playing game that revolves around a powerful, mystic object called the Orb, which has been shattered into seven pieces called Wards. The seven Wards were scattered, each located in one of the seven corners of the world, housed in a pyramid. King Cricken accidentally destroyed the Orb when casting magics to defeat the Evil Ones (sending them back to their netherworld), and then disappeared in a flash of thunder. The forces of Evil were weakened that day, but they have started to become powerful once again. It is up to the player to take over King Cricken's quest by finding the pieces of the Orb and reassemble this powerful device to put a stop to the spread of Evil.", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "QWare", "publishers": "QWare", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OrbQuest:_The_Search_For_Seven_Wards", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151749-orbquest-the-search-for-seven-wards\n"}
