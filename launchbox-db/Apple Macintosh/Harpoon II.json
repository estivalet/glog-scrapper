{"altername_name": [], "name": "Harpoon II", "overview": "Harpoon II is a simulation of modern-era naval combat. A variety of ships such as surface and sub, as well as missile weapons and aircraft must be tracked and accounted for when engaging in battles. It is a single player game, and takes place in real-time (though you can set the clock ratio to suit your needs and even pause the game). Rather than being a straight Cold War-style U.S.S.R. vs the USA game, Harpoon II's scenarios are mostly based on third-world encounters, such as USA vs North Korea, or Peru vs Ecuador, etc. The initial release contains BattleSet: Global Conflicts I, featuring 15 missions. You take charge of a naval force composed of either few small ships armed with only cannons and light rockets/missiles, or an entire carrier strike force with it's own air force and long-range cruise missiles.", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Three-Sixty Pacific", "publishers": "IntraCorp", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151663-harpoon-ii\n"}
