Unlike most of the Lemmings games, it does not use a side-scrolling perspective but instead an isometric view of the levels. The gameplay is also very different from other Lemmings games, focusing on splattering enemies with paint from a gun. The levels contain various puzzles including moving platforms, lemming catapults, and trampolines.", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Psygnosis", "publishers": "Imagineer", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151937-lemmings-paintball-for-macintosh\n"}
