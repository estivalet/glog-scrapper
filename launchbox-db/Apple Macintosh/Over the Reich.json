{"altername_name": [], "name": "Over the Reich", "overview": "Over the Reich is a turn-based strategy/flight simulator hybrid. It takes place during World War II, and you can fly for either the German Luftwaffe, the Royal Air Force, or the USA Air Force. There is a campaign mode and plenty of single missions to keep you occupied. On the harder skill levels it's just like a normal first person flight simulator, with banks, stalls, altitude, etc, except in a turn-based world.", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Big Time Software", "publishers": "The Avalon Hill Game Company", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_the_Reich", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151751-over-the-reich\n"}
