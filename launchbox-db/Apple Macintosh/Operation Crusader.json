{"altername_name": [], "name": "Operation Crusader", "overview": "A military strategy wargame focusing on the African desert campaign of legendary Erwin Rommel; specifically, the period between November and December, 1941 when Rommel's offensive is driven close to the Suez Canal and American supplies have given an edge to the Commonwealth Eight Army. Consisting of 5 single-battle scenarios and one campaign game, you are trusted into either the Allied or the Axis side using a modified version of the V for victory engine with the same wargame mechanics but with several additions such as more realistic fog of war, the ability to select different types of attacks, from low-intensity probes, to all-out assaults. You can play vs a human opponent via e-mails or take on the computer using a \"Random Variant\" option which guarantees some surprises on every game.", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atomic Games", "publishers": "The Avalon Hill Game Company", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Crusader_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151746-operation-crusader\n"}
