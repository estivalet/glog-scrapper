{"altername_name": ["Mac Command"], "name": "MacCommand", "overview": "MacCommand is a Missile Command variant. Like in other games of its kind the objective is to protect a city from being destroyed by air attacks. The game is played with the mouse which is used to move a crosshair around the screen. Enemies will fly across the screen and drop projectiles towards the city which initially is protected by a force field. Clicking with the mouse or pressing the space bar launches a missiles from one of three missile bases (depending on which is nearest the target) which destroys any target that is within its range of explosion. As buildings are destroyed people fall from them onto the streets where ambulances will arrive and pick them up. The game ends when all buildings have been destroyed. There are several different types of enemies including balloons, helicopters and dive bombers. They all drop bombs that can do damage to the city if not shot down in time. There are also paratroopers which if they manage to reach the ground will run to a missile base and destroy it permanently. Missile bases that are destroyed by bombs are rebuilt for every new level. Firing missiles damages the city's force field while destroying a target restores it. Hence accurate shooting is rewarded.", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Creighton Development", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151703-maccommand\n"}
