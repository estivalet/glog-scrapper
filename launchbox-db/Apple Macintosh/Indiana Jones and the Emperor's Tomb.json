This time, he must travel his way through-out Asia to recover an artifact that, according to those who required his assistance, is the most powerful in the world. As usual, Indy isn't the only one who is out to find the treasure, with the Nazi's right on his tail. Along with a heavy dose of exploration, whip cracking and platform jumping, you will also control Indy through fighting elements against a range of enemies. Hand-to-hand combat and a collection of weapons (from guns to table legs) can be used to defend yourself.", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "2004", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "TransGaming Technologies", "publishers": "Aspyr Media", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Emperor%27s_Tomb", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151936-indiana-jones-and-the-emperors-tomb\n"}
