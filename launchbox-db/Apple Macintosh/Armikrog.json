{"altername_name": [], "name": "Armikrog", "overview": "From the creators of the Earthworm Jim and The Neverhood games, comes a ground breaking stop motion clay animated adventure game called Armikrog. Based on characters created by Doug TenNapel, the game follows the adventures of a space explorer named Tommynaut and his blind alien talking dog named Beak-Beak as they crash land on a weird planet and end up locked in a mysterious fortress called Armikrog. The game is being created using classic sculpting, set building and clay & puppet fabrication methods combined with stop-motion animation. Voiceover talent, including well-known actors Jon Heder (Napoeon Dynamite), Rob Paulsen (Pinky and the Brain) and Michael J. Nelson (Mystery Science Theater 3000) bring Armikrog\u2019s characters to life with tongue-in-cheek humor enhanced by the original soundtrack from American songwriter and record producer Terry Taylor.", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "August 18, 2015", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "developers": "Pencil Test Studios", "publishers": "Versus Evil LLC", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fArOdmx8kLQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/30590-armikrog\n"}
