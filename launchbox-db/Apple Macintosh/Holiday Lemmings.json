{"altername_name": [], "name": "Holiday Lemmings", "overview": "The 1994 edition of Holiday Lemmings is the second full game in the series of Christmas-themed Lemmings games, after two free demos in 1991 and 1992 and a commercial 1993 version. Gameplay is unchanged from the original game: players are tasked with leading a horde of Lemmings to the level exit by assigning them special abilities. The holiday theme shows in snow-covered landscapes, the Lemmings wearing Christmas outfits and appropriate background music. The game includes 32 all-new levels, grouped into two difficulties: Frost and Hail. It also comes with all 32 levels from the 1993 version (Flurry and Blizzard difficulties).", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "DMA Design", "publishers": "Psygnosis", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/129729-holiday-lemmings\n"}
