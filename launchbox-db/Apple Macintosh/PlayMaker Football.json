{"altername_name": [], "name": "PlayMaker Football", "overview": "PlayMaker Football is a top-down simulation of American football . It is made out of three primary sections - The Game / Team Draft / Chalkboard Editor. The game allows one to take the role of a coach of a team of 25 football players. The coach can create a team using the Team Draft mode of the program, and then design and test plays using the Chalkboard Editor mode. The Chalkboard Editor mode also allows the coach to create artificial intelligence settings for each play, used by the program to determine which play to call on each down of a game. The Game mode allows the coach to play games between two teams, each under the control of a coach or the computer.", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Brian Brinkmann", "publishers": "Br\u00f8derbund Software", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayMaker_Football", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151756-playmaker-football\n"}
