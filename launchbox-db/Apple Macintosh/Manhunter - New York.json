{"altername_name": [], "name": "Manhunter: New York", "overview": "The Earth has been invaded by the Orb Alliance, and a tightly restricted regime instituted for the humans that remain. Brown monk robes are the only garments allowed, speaking is a capital offense, and every human has been implanted with a tracking chip recording their every move. To track down criminals, the Orbs enlist \"Manhunters\" - humans given access to advanced technology and selected to be a combination of police officers and bounty hunters. The player controls one such Manhunter as he unravels a conspiracy inside the decaying heart of the New York ruins, and a mysterious serial killer on the loose.", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Evryware", "publishers": "Sierra On-Line", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhunter:_New_York", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151536-manhunter-new-york\n"}
