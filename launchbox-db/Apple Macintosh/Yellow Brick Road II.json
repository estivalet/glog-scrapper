{"altername_name": [], "name": "Yellow Brick Road II", "overview": "Glinda is being held captive in a magical crystal ball and must be saved! This sequel adventure to Yellow Brick Road is a two cd-rom set and was only released in Japan. A new great adventure in addition to the emergence of a new character creature who is half-man and half-fish, pottery people, and the turnip King. Again, the kingdom is in a big crisis. Glinda has been deprived of her liberty by the Witch of the West, who conspires to rule Emerald City. A combination of interactive mode while moving smoothly in a 3D space to solve events produces a new sense of entertainment! In addition to familiar members such as lion, scarecrow, and tin man, there is a stretching of the nihilistic tone. There is a musical, and there is spectacle, and you engage in a powerful story. Hiroyuki Miura directs the work.", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "August 30, 1996", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Synergy", "publishers": "Synergy", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151873-yellow-brick-road-ii\n"}
