{"altername_name": ["Nanosaur Extreme"], "name": "Nanosaur", "overview": "You are a dinosaur (a Nanosaur to be exact) from the future who has traveled back in time to collect the eggs of 5 dinosaur species before the giant asteroid hits the earth. The \"primitive\" dinosaurs will attack you as you try to get their eggs, but just remember that it's for their own good that you blast them into oblivion! Being a dinosaur from the future, you are equipped with several pieces of technology to help you in your mission. Fusion Blaster: a multi-purpose weapon for killing things. Jet Pack: For flying over things that might kill you. Temporal Compass: for finding time portals. GPS Locator: for figuring out where you are and where you should go. You can jump, swim, run around, jet around, shoot stuff, and more. The general rule to playing the game is \"if it moves, kill it or it'll kill you.\" You only have 20 minutes to collect all 5 egg species, so being efficient about your actions is critical. Will you somehow save each species of dinosaur forever, or has your mission been in vain?", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "April 6, 1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Ideas From the Deep", "publishers": "Ideas From the Deep", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanosaur", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/166946-nanosaur\n"}
