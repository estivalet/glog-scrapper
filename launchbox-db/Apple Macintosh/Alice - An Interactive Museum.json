{"altername_name": [], "name": "Alice: An Interactive Museum", "overview": "The player searches through a museum of twelve rooms for a deck of 53 cards, upon which are clues which will lead to the last room and the end game. Those cards are hidden among artwork inspired by Lewis Carroll's Alice novels - to find them the player has to solve puzzles of varying complexity. The art is very interactive, but those hot spots are not marked when touching them with the mouse. Finding them might result in bizarre results like turning the room upside-down. This game knows no save feature and doesn't track how many cards are found. The player needs to write down the clues he already found until he can puzzle together how to find the exit.", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Synergy", "publishers": "Toshiba-EMI", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/150938-alice-an-interactive-museum\n"}
