{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Dungeon Revealed", "overview": "The Dungeon Revealed is a dungeon crawl PC game created by John Raymonds and published by Woodrose Editions in 1987. The player controls a single character trapped in an underground dungeon. If the character attempts to take the stairs from the dungeon, a message appears: \"A force prevents you from escaping to the surface. Maybe the Orb will set you free...\" Like this message, much of the game's story and mechanics are vague or undocumented. Most of the player's information comes from a window called Rumors, which contains 26 short, cryptic statements. The dungeon is divided into 40 floors, each with one staircase going up and one going down. The floor plan of each level is randomly generated but remains unchanged throughout a single game. Though each level is about the same size, the complexity of the floor plans becomes more maze-like as the character descends to deeper dungeon levels. There are also items, including weapons, armor, magical rings, scrolls, potions, wands, food items, and jewels placed randomly throughout the dungeon's floors.", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "John Raymonds", "publishers": "Woodrose Editions", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dungeon_Revealed", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/167607-the-dungeon-revealed\n"}
