{"altername_name": [], "name": "Escape Velocity Override", "overview": "Sequel to Escape Velocity, this space trading simulation uses extended features of the original game engine. It has a new story in a different larger universe with over a hundred star systems connected by a series of hyperlanes. Hyper-jumps using these take 1-3 days depending on the ship's mass. Ships can land at planets, stations, and some other stellar objects. If it's an inhabited place, you can access the mission computer to customize your ship with weapons and outfits, purchase new ships, refuel, take jobs, or trade commodities. At spaceport bars, you can gamble, hire escort ships, watch the news, and sometimes receive additional unique missions. Star systems are controlled by different governments which may be friendly, restrict some areas or are openly hostile. You can change status towards them by taking missions from them, attacking their enemies, and destroying pirates. If you help opposing governments, attack the government's or their allies' ships, or pirate civilians, your status will worsen with them. The gameplay is open-ended and the player can choose any strategy they wish to pursue.", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "1998", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Ambrosia Software", "publishers": "Ambrosia Software", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_Velocity_Override", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/146708-escape-velocity-override\n"}
