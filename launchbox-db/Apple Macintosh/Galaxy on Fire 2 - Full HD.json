As he's on his way to Eden Prime to collect the reward for disposing a band of space pirates, his hyperdrive malfunctions and thrusts him though time. Awakening in the future, he will have to restart from scratch in a galaxy that has changed a lot in the meantime. And of course, eventually our hero will have to face a new galactic threat... Like its predecessor, Galaxy on Fire 2 is a mix of space shooter, intergalactic trade and cosmic adventure, similar in concept to games like Privateer or Freelancer. The game offers two modes of control: by using the accelerometer to control the steering of the ship, or by using a virtual joystick.", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "August 25, 2011", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Fishlabs Entertainment", "publishers": "bitComposer Games", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/15654-galaxy-on-fire-2-full-hd\n"}
