{"altername_name": ["Cosmic Osmo"], "name": "Cosmic Osmo and the Worlds Beyond the Mackerel", "overview": "Cosmic Osmo is a point-and-click graphical adventure game for kids made by Cyan which would later make the hugely successful Myst series. This is an open-ended exploring game where you can click on various elements on screen to trigger events, and clicking on doors or the edge of the screen will move you to another location. You first enter an animated spaceship which later is used to travel between different planets. Shortcuts also exist to other places in small spots like a mouse hole or a water drain. There is no way to die or get hurt in the game and you can't lose either. It was made originally on Macintosh using Hypercard, a combined software and run-time environment that mixes database capabilities with a graphical, flexible, user-modifiable interface. The game was one of the first on CD-Rom but a floppy disk version with fewer planets and no background music was also available. In 2008, it was ported to Windows exclusively on Gametap.", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "June 21, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Cyan", "publishers": "Cyan", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "0.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_Osmo_and_the_Worlds_Beyond_the_Mackerel", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/129639-cosmic-osmo-and-the-worlds-beyond-the-mackerel\n"}
