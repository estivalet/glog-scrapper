{"altername_name": [], "name": "Troubled Souls", "overview": "Troubled Souls is a Pipe Dream derivative, but not a clone. You connect pipes not to stop the flow of a fluid but to connect them into a shape with no openings. As time goes on you will find special pipes worth extra points, and in the rather dark gothic theme of the game they are often body parts impaled by the very pipes you will be using. The game ends when you can't make any more ends meet.", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "September 1, 1994", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Randy Reddig", "publishers": "Varcon Systems", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troubled_Souls", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/150925-troubled-souls\n"}
