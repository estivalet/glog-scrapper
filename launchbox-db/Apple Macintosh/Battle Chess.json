{"altername_name": [], "name": "Battle Chess", "overview": "Battle Chess is a quite typical chess game, but it comes with a twist: all pieces are represented by small, realistic figures that walk around on the chessboard, and when one piece takes another, they both take part in an animated battle. There is a different animation for each permutation, depending on which pieces are capturing or being captured. You can also play in 2D without animation. The game's opening library includes 30,000 different moves, ensuring a variety of games will unfold across the 10 skill levels. Multi-player support can be extended to modem and/or serial port play.", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Interplay Entertainment", "publishers": "Interplay Entertainment", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.12", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_Chess", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/114583-battle-chess\n"}
