{"altername_name": [], "name": "Harrier Strike Mission", "overview": "Harrier Strike Force is a jet simulation without plot. The game features one island with a gas fuel station, an airport and a tank headquarter with the simple goal to destroy everything. Of course there is resistance: there are five jets and ten tanks on the island. Those only get active after the previous is destroyed and rise in difficulty - destroying the associated building takes care about all at once. The player has access to three weapons: an unlimited 30mm cannon, three heat-seeking rockets (effective against jets) and 16 heat bombs for defense against enemy rockets. After everything is destroyed, the jet has to safely return to base. All this has to be completed before the jet fuel runs out, effectively giving the player only a few minutes to complete the goals. The main motivational factor is optimizing the high score because the effective measures (e.g. using the rockets or destroying the airport first) give much less points than the hard way. The player has various options for setting the game variables, e.g. difficulty or enemy behavior, but this prevents access to the high score list.", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tim Hays", "publishers": "Miles Computing", "genres": "Flight Simulator", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151664-harrier-strike-mission\n"}
