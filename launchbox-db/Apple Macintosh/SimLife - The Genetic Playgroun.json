Feel free to create funky animals! How about a giant snail that would have to eat several trees each day to survive - or a small kangaroo that would lay eggs and eat only bugs? You can even edit their DNA code, and make your animals mutate.", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Maxis", "publishers": "Maxis", "genres": "Life Simulation", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/145883-simlife-the-genetic-playgroun\n"}
