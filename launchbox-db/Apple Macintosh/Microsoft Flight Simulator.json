{"altername_name": [], "name": "Microsoft Flight Simulator", "overview": "Flight Simulator for the Apple Macintosh became the third port of FS to a Motorola 68000 platform, following the Amiga and Atari ST. However, Microsoft, rather than subLOGIC, published the Mac version. While the first Mac release was dubbed \"Version 1.0\", it was in fact released four years after Version 1.0 for the PC, and thus was much different in nature. The graphics engine was much closer to Flight Simulator II for the Amiga and Atari ST. Naturally, the Mac edition was monochrome only, but at a higher resolution. The mouse was used for the throttle, yoke, and brakes, while the keyboard controlled the rest. Like FS II and MSFS 3.0, FS1 for the Mac featured pull-down menus and multiple view windows for the cockpit, spot plane, map, and control tower. MSFS for Mac could run on any classic Mac down to the 128k, although at that level, the \"war game\", sound, and situation library were disabled. With 512k RAM, in-game help was available for each instrument and menu function.", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sublogic", "publishers": "Microsoft", "genres": "Flight Simulator", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Flight_Simulator_(1986_video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151717-microsoft-flight-simulator\n"}
