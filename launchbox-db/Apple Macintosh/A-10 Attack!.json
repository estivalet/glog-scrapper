{"altername_name": [], "name": "A-10 Attack!", "overview": "A-10 Attack! is an air combat flight simulator. The game features the A-10 Thunderbolt II aircraft, affectionately known as the \"Warthog,\" with a very comprehensive and realistic flight model for its day. In addition to a detailed cockpit and fast 3D polygonal graphics, A-10 Attack! features a map overview where the player can command a small squadron of aircraft including F-16's, F-15's, and C-5 Galaxy transport aircraft. The scenario is a fictional invasion of West Germany by Soviet forces and because of that the actual combat missions take place over Germany (the training missions are set in a desert arena). A wide variety of weapons are available for air-air and air-ground combat, including Sidewinder, Hellfire, Maverick and HARM missiles and free-fall, laser-guided and cluster bombs. Created by Eric Parker, writer of Hellcats Over the Pacific, the game offered features never previously seen in air combat simulations for the Macintosh.", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "1995", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Parsoft Interactive", "publishers": "Parsoft Interactive", "genres": "Flight Simulator", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/123480-a-10-attack\n"}
