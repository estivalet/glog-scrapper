{"altername_name": [], "name": "Samurai Mech", "overview": "A futuristic Japan-only RPG for the Macintosh set in Oedo, a gigantic city floating in space around Earth's moon. Remains of a highly-advanced civilization were found when the city was built, in the form of \"mech\" technology. You play as a young samurai apprentice that begins to have ominous dreams about his father and must solve the mystery behind a group of mysterious ninjas. Samurai Mech's main quality are its amazing presentation and art work. The artist made full use of the Macintosh graphical abilities and created a gorgeous game, with each illustration, menu and even the combat screen building up to the game's \"Space-Japan\" aesthetic.", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "1992", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hulinks", "publishers": "Hulinks", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151778-samurai-mech\n"}
