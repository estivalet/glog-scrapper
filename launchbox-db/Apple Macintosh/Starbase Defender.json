{"altername_name": [], "name": "Starbase Defender", "overview": "Starbase Defender is an arcade game in which the player is tasked with defending an interstellar base from successive waves of invaders by using a stationary turret. In an attempt to develop a device capable of space travel scientists have recently uncovered six emergent cores from the Los/Selactos Singularity. Fearing attack, the cores have been concealed within your starbase until such time as reinforcements can arrive. Knowledge of the discovery has spread rapidly, however, and a coalition of alien mercenaries is en route to the base with the intention of stealing them, leaving you as the only one who can prevent them. While at a numerical disadvantage the player's base is equipped not only with multiple shields but with a NOVA weapon, capable of slowing enemy ships and causing them mild damage. Upgrade ships will also randomly appear to assist in the defense by delivering much needed supplies and shield regenerators.", "platform": "Apple Mac OS", "release_date": "2004", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bigger Planet", "publishers": "Bigger Planet", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/151813-starbase-defender\n"}
