{"altername_name": [], "name": "Guy in the Hat", "overview": "A game in which you have to eat as many biscuits as you can while avoiding the 4 meanies that follow you around. It is played on a hexagonal grid, making moving somewhat awkward. If you eat a biscuit the hexagon it was in will change colour. The meanies cannot enter these hexagons and if you enter one you will die. Drop your hat to colour a hexagon white. You can enter these but the meanies can't. If you change a hexagon to white while a meanie is in it you will destroy him and gain 1000 points. The game was re-released in 1988 by Blue Ribbon on their Games Disc 2 compilation, and also on cassette twinned with Secret Sam 2.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mike Goldberg", "publishers": "MRM Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://youtube.com/watch?v=zs_ACTLSTr4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78458-guy-in-the-hat\n"}
