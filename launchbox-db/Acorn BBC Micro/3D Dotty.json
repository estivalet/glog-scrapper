{"altername_name": [], "name": "3D Dotty", "overview": "3D Dotty is a video game published by Blue Ribbon for the Acorn Electron and BBC Micro home computers in 1987. The aim is to clear the dots on the three levels of each screen while avoiding the dreaded fungus. Any contact with the fungus will reduce energy, and a life is lost when the energy reaches zero. The fungus can be blocked, but only three blocks are permitted at any one time. On completing a screen a bonus is added to the score, proportional to the amount of energy remaining. There are eight different screens. After the eighth, the screens are repeated, but energy is reduced by two units upon contact with the fungus. Extra lives are awarded when the score reaches 5,000 and 10,000 points. There is a practice mode to allow the player to try any of the eight screens.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "J L Harris", "publishers": "Blue Ribbon Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.33", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_Dotty", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46gaN0mCqcs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40423-3d-dotty\n"}
