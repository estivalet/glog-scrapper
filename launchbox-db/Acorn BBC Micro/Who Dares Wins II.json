{"altername_name": [], "name": "Who Dares Wins II", "overview": "Eight invaded townships must be brought back under your control in this Commando-style shoot 'em up, which progresses vertically using a flick-screen system. You are armed with a rifle and five grenades, and must not only kill off the enemy forces, but also rescue your comrades who have been tied to trees along the way. You begin at the bottom of the first screen and slowly make your way upwards; enemies pop up from all sides, walking around and shooting, and you have to dodge their shots while trying to shoot them yourself. The foes make good use of the decoy opportunities of the terrain, and you must do the same to have a chance. The levels include rivers with narrow bridges, potholes, and train-lines. Extra supplies are dropped in as you progress through the game, as are extra lives in addition to your starting 5. Who Dares Wins II was released as a new version of Who Dares Wins, as the original had an injunction against it from Elite, who felt the game was too similar to Commando. The maps were changed to make it different from Commando.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Toby Butler", "publishers": "Alligata Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/85328-who-dares-wins-ii\n"}
