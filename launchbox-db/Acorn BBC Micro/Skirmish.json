{"altername_name": ["Joust"], "name": "Skirmish", "overview": "Aardvark's plans to publish this release as Joust were well advanced, but a licensing deal with Atari could not be struck. Eventually Go-Dax stepped in and released it as Skirmish. You control a knight who rides a flying ostrich around rocky platforms which float above a flat island. The ostrich may fly upwards, hover, or slowly descend, depending on the rate at which you flap its wings. You have to defeat successive waves of enemy knights by colliding with them.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Stuart Cheshire", "publishers": "Go-Dax", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpI1fj8jiIg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/77672-skirmish\n"}
