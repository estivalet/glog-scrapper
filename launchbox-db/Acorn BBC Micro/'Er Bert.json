{"altername_name": ["Crazy Er*Bert", "Er*Bert"], "name": "'Er*Bert", "overview": "Er*Bert (re-released by Alternative Software as Crazy Er*Bert) is a Q*Bert type game. The aim is to visit each cube so that its top surface changes colour. At the start you can choose from 10 levels of difficulty and whether movement should be fast or slow. Er*Bert is persistently chased by Coily Snake and Boris Gorilla. If they catch you one of your three lives is lost. Escape is provided by two elevators which return you to the surface. If Boris or Coily try to follow, they vanish for a few seconds. This gives you a chance to escape, and gain some bonus points. Er*Bert can also collect a Rota Hat which allows you limited flight with two extra keys required to manage the flying skills. Elevators and Rota Hats can only be used once. To add to the problems, boulders roll down the cubes. In higher skill levels some of the cubes turn into vaporisers. These have a drastic effect on your life expectancy but fortunately they don't last long. Also at the higher levels, Erbert cannot manage to paint the cubes at the first attempt. You have to apply the undercoat on the first visit and a second trip is required to put on the top coat. To score high points you can make Er*Bert pick up Boris's banana. This also causes Boris to lose his temper, but you can drop the banana with a quick press of Space. If Er*Bert manages to recolour all his cubes you move to a new and more complicated screen.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dave Kirby", "publishers": "Alternative Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTZdm8mKiaw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/84644-erbert\n"}
