{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cosmic Fighter", "overview": "Cosmic Fighter is an arcade-action game similar to Space Invaders or Galaxian. You have to shoot waves of aliens, which will also shoot at you. After a while there is a level where you have to exactly shoot an alien spaceship in the middle when its \"mouth\" is open. There is a twist in the fact that later levels force you to shoot twice at an alien to kill it.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Walter Mansell", "publishers": "Kansas City Systems", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le9qEBvOUJ4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/127694-cosmic-fighter\n"}
