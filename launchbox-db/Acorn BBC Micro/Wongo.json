{"altername_name": [], "name": "Wongo", "overview": "This was a Hunchback type game for the BBC Microcomputer and Acorn Electron. It was originally written by Gary Partis to experiment with 'sideways scrolling' using the 6845 CRTC chip, but became a commercial product and was published by Icon. The variation was that instead of a huncback it was a Chinaman on a pogo stick. It was originally called 'Pogo' until a publisher took the game onboard.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Gary Partis", "publishers": "Icon", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/45324-wongo\n"}
