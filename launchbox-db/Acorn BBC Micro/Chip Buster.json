A highly original game, this one has you running around the actual circuit boards of either a BBC B, B+ or Crazy Computer! You run along the copper tracks, and have to traverse your way through the maze like structure, fixing the problems on the circuit board with your hammer. You get points at the end for each part of the circuit you fix, and it gets harder and harder, with more bugs trying to kill you.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Software Invasion", "publishers": "Software Invasion", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/45931-chip-buster\n"}
