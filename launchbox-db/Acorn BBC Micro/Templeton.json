{"altername_name": [], "name": "Templeton", "overview": "Templeton was programmed by Jeffrey Cooke and published by Bug Byte in 1987 for the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron. It is compatible with the BBC Model B+ and Master 128 machines as well. Templeton is a neglected rat that has been left to fend for itself in the sewers wishes to escape and return to the city. Within the hostile community, starfish, rubbish bins, sea anenomes, clams and fish are all deadly enemies, while turnstiles are merely troublesome in blocking it's path to freedom. Your objective is to help Templeton to find his way through the 30 sewer systems. Turnstiles may only be passed if Templeton possesses the correct colour ticket. New tickets can be obtained by touching the ticket character. Note: pass at the bottom of the screen changes colour. A high pitched \"beeping\" indicates a lack of energy (approx. 10 secs). A bubble will restore energy. A starfish can only be moved if Templeton is directly above or below that character. The rubbish bin can only be passed whilst immobile and closed. When open and roving, it is fatal. On the appearance of a ghost, attempt to turn a corner as soon as possible.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jeffrey Cooke", "publishers": "Bug-Byte Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40531-templeton\n"}
