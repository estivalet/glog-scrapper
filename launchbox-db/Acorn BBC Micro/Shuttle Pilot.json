{"altername_name": ["Space Shuttle Pilot"], "name": "Shuttle Pilot", "overview": "Your mission is to launch the Shuttle into space on a pre-set flight path. You must then orbit the earth to find two satellites, the first is from an enemy and will explode and destroy you, unless you destroy him with your laser first. Next, you must find your own N.A.S.A. satellite and with the Shuttle's remote-controlled arm bring it safely on board. The last, and perhaps most difficult, task now faces you, bringing your precious cargo safely back to earth. You may choose to fly a complete mission as above, or to practise separate sections: Satellite attack, Satellite rescue, Manual landing.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Mark Power", "publishers": "Oakleaf Computers Ltd", "genres": "Flight Simulator", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/371508-shuttle-pilot\n"}
