{"altername_name": ["Swag", "Swag!"], "name": "$wag", "overview": "Swag is a 1 or 2 player video game developed by Dave Herbert and published by Micro Power for the BBC Microcomputer in 1983. You are out to steal \u00a3250,000 in diamonds before your rival. You accomplish this by collecting the heaps of diamonds which appear on the screen, and taking them to the cache in your house. Unfortunately, the other robber is not your only problem. There are several killer droids, employed by one of the insurance companies, who try to apprehend bandits such as yourself and recover the swag. There are two types of the droids Henrys and Percys. One type will try to catch you; the other your opponent. You can \"convert\" one which is following you by shooting it. You can also shoot the other player's man, and if caught by a droid or shot you will drop your swag and be returned to your house. Naturally, you will soon use up all the ammunition in your gun, but you can get more by depositing gold in the bank. The other way to convert droids is to move onto a \"DH\", which changes all Henrys to Percys, and vice versa. Moving onto a Smiley has the effect of sending your opponent back to his house. If you shoot a police car, it will follow you around the screen, which gives points to the other player, though you can stop this by drinking a can of beer (the sort which refreshes the parts other beers can't) and shooting them again.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Dave Herbert", "publishers": "Micro Power", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/41093-wag\n"}
