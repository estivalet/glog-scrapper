{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cavey", "overview": "In this off-beat shooter, you control a caveman called Cavey. He has been trapped in the Valley of the Doomed and needs your help to fight off the swarming Pterodactyls using only five spears. The Pterodactyls cannot fly low enough to catch Cavey but carry rocks from the surrounding cliffs to drop on him, in order to knock him off his log bridge. Remember that Cavey must pick up spears before he can throw them.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Andrew Oliver", "publishers": "Players Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/87298-cavey\n"}
