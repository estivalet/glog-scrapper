{"altername_name": ["Q Man's Brother"], "name": "Q-Man's Brother", "overview": "A variant on the QBert style games. Instead of the familiar pyramid, Q-Man's Brother hops round an aerial walkway, but the goal remains the same. Turn the square a different colour, and avoid the predators. In this game you are pursued by a multi-coloured bucket and a paint roller which erases your squares. To help you keep on top of things, smart bombs are available in limited supply, with a new one after each screen", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Mike Williams", "publishers": "Blue Ribbon Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86620-q-mans-brother\n"}
