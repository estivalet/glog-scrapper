{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sorcery", "overview": "No relation to the more well-known arcade adventure, Sorcery for the BBC is an arcade platformer in the same vein as Donkey Kong. You, in the shape of a hooded swordsman, must climb four floors of platforms to reach an evil magician who has taken your wife captive. While there are only four stairs to scale, it is a difficult task because of the ghosts, fire-breathing birds, arrows and flying magical balls. You must alternate between using your sword or jumping across them, or fooling the ghosts by going to a lower platform, then up again. One peculiarity about Sorcery is that if you are hit, you don't immediately lose your life. Instead, you are transformed into a frog, sitting at the bottom of the screen, and your wife is given the opportunity to climb down to the bottom to free you from the spell.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Pace", "publishers": "Pace", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/51395-sorcery\n"}
