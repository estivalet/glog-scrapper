{"altername_name": [], "name": "Renegade Robots", "overview": "A Pengo clone in which you must re-align the three key control cubes or, failing that, destroy all of the renegade robots. In order to accomplish your task, you have the ability to slide the cubes by pushing them in the desired direction. Attempting to push a cube towards an adjacent border or cube causes it to disintegrate (the key cubes cannot be destroyed). There are two timers in the game, namely the Preview (the magenta counter) and the Bonus timer (the white counter). The Preview allows you time to work out your plan of action, but if you move sooner then the preview time immediately expires and your mission will have begun. If the bonus timer expires then you move onto the next screen.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Senator Software", "publishers": "Senator Software", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hU21p-TXBnc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/79069-renegade-robots\n"}
