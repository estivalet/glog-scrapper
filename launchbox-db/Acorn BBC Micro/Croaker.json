{"altername_name": [], "name": "Croaker", "overview": "A clone of the classic Frogger in which you must get five frogs back to their bases at the top of the screen. There are five lanes of traffic, three lines of logs and two lines of turtles. If you negotiate Phase 1 successfully, you move on to a higher phase. The roads become busier, some logs turn into crocodiles and the turtles sometimes dive, making the whole exercise much trickier.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Chris Butler", "publishers": "Program Power", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS4zMUQ8MMc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/103150-croaker\n"}
