{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Dam Busters", "overview": "The Dam Busters (aka The Dambusters) is a game by US Gold, not to be confused with the 1983 game \"Dambusters\" by Alligata. The Dam Busters is an early flight simulation, set in World War II. It focuses on Dam Busters who historically were used to heavily bombard strategic objectives, in this case dams. This task is not easy, as en route you will face heavy opposition forces. Fortunately, you won't be a sitting bomber in the air. Your aircraft is equipped with machine guns (left and right) with unlimited rounds of firepower, so fire at will as the enemy approaches. When the time comes, you will have to bomb the target manually.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sydney Development Corp", "publishers": "U.S. Gold", "genres": "Flight Simulator", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydPaWPBKByU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/77152-the-dam-busters\n"}
