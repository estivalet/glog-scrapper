{"altername_name": ["Space Ace"], "name": "3D Space Raiders", "overview": "Written in 1983 by Alligata Software, 3D Space Raiders (aka Space Ace) is in some ways a precursor to the better-known Elite, though far simpler in graphics and gameplay. The game was never released as a standalone, only featuring as part of compilation tapes; its first outing was as part of 'Fistful of Fun' in 1984. Aliens have invaded the galaxy, and you have to navigate from sector to sector, tracking down the enemy ships with your 3-d scanner, while maintaining your fuel and energy for shields, and without running out of torpedoes. Direct hits can damage or destroy your ship, and you may have to hyperspace back to a Starbase for repairs if you take too many. Scoring is based on ships destroyed and time taken.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Alligata Software", "publishers": "Alligata Software", "genres": "Flight Simulator", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVRBtjzaONM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/119276-3d-space-raiders\n"}
