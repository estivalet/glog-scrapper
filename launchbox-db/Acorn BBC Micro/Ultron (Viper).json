This game was developed by Daniel Lucas and S A Subotsky for Alligata but they never released it themselves. Instead it was passed to Viper who published it. Destroy all waves of aliens and avoid or destroy the asteroids, then dock with the mothership. All photon blasts missing their targets will be recorded as photon wastage and excessive wastage will result in the destruction of your laser base. After docking with the mothership, you will receive a bonus according to your shooting accuracy (measured by photon wastage).", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Daniel Lucas", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/156632-ultron-viper\n"}
