{"altername_name": ["Cells and Serpents"], "name": "Cells & Serpents", "overview": "Go adventuring in the meanest, darkest, most definitely fatal set of dungeons you ever waved a sword around! There re more monsters than you ever dared to have nightmares about. Fancy meeting a Mind Flayer for instance? How about being sized up by an Intellect Devourer? If you live long enough (doubtful) and might just get to shake hands with Asmodeus! Once only mind... There is great gold and glory to be had here, but be very, very careful where you tread! You can save your game unto tape at any point if it all gets too much and carry on once you've recovered your nerve... find out how good you really are at adventure with this frantic fantasy frolic. Not for the faint of heart or slow of sword. The game: Cells and Serpents is an adventure game set in an underground labyrinth of rooms. Each of these may contain one of an enormous variety of monsters (which could kill you), treasure or artifacts (which will increase your wealth or magical and physical capabilities). Your aim is to collect as much treasure as possible by delving deeper and deeper into the maze...and staying alive!", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "ASP Software Ltd.", "publishers": "ASP Software", "genres": "Role-Playing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HAnm34ym7w", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/126992-cells-serpents\n"}
