{"altername_name": [], "name": "Atomic Protector", "overview": "Atomic Protector was programmed by Kevin Edwards and published by Optima Software for the BBC Microcomputer in September, 1983. It is a fast-paced arcade title, like Pac-Man but in reverse. The player has to protect already laid down dots on the map instead of picking them up. The enemies are of two kinds. One will run around the map, picking up all the dots. The other kind is radioactive, and it must be caught before it contaminates you.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Kevin Edwards", "publishers": "Optima Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JieAGlNgoy0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/41119-atomic-protector\n"}
