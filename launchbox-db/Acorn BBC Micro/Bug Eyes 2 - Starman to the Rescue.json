Light years from Earth lies the rusting hulk of the Xxabanean flagship, disabled when its power generator was destroyed by Space Agent Zelda. But Zelda was captured and imprisoned in the depths of a distant and desolate asteroid. Somewhere hidden on the rusting ship are the 25 keys that are needed to free Zelda from her intergalactic prison. Your mission, as Space Agent Starman, is to penetrate the defences of the ship and find the 25 keys in order to rescue Zelda. Some of the old Xxanabean booby traps are still in operation, and strange alien creatures have moved into the empty hulk. You have only five refills of oxygen. Your limited supply is depleted more quickly by collisions with objects and creatures. You must find the key before it runs out.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jason Sobell", "publishers": "Alternative Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-EPD25akiM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40386-bug-eyes-2-starman-to-the-rescue\n"}
