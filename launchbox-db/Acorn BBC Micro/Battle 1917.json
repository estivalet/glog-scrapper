{"altername_name": [], "name": "Battle 1917", "overview": "Battle 1917 is a turn-based strategy game for one or two players. The game background is World War I with its new technology and the first use of tanks. Players command 29 units of five types: infantry, cavalry, tanks, artillery and a king. The object of the game, like in chess, is to kill the enemy king who is the weakest and slowest piece on the board. Each unit has different stats. The map is 21x32 squares large and is randomly generated for every new game. Objects on the map include wires, forests, rivers and units. The game was programmed by Mark Lucas for the Sinclair Spectrum and converted to the BBC Micro by P Martin. Mark Lucas won the 1983 Cambridge Award for Battle 1917.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "CCS", "publishers": "CCS", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_GoaHvZJMM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/77032-battle-1917\n"}
