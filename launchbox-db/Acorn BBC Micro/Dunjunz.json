{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dunjunz", "overview": "Dunjunz is a video game made for the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron home computers and released by Bug-Byte in 1987. It is essentially a clone of the popular video game Gauntlet where players controlled fantasy characters from a top down view. Unlike Gauntlet, each of the characters is given their own viewport onto the dungeon and can explore independently. Up to four players are able to play simultaneously, sharing the keyboard to control their characters. Each player views their character's progress via one of four viewports that divide the screen. As their character leaves a room, the viewport changes to show the new room.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Julian Avis", "publishers": "Bug-Byte Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40607-dunjunz\n"}
