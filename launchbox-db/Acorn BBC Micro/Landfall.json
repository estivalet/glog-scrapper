{"altername_name": [], "name": "Landfall", "overview": "You are sitting at the controls of a shuttle and all the information about your descent is displayed on the panels in front of you. There is also a monitor which shows how your craft is aligning itself. It is essential to keep on course and to correct any sideways drift with the altitude jets which are controlled with the cursor keys. Rate of descent is determined by the choice of thruster power (function keys 0 to 9) and a nice touch is the way the ship revs up through the thrusters until it reaches your choice. The descent needs very careful handling indeed, finely balancing velocity, altitude, thrust and fuel in order not to overheat.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Gregory Trezise", "publishers": "Virgin Games", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/156591-landfall\n"}
