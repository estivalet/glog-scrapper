{"altername_name": [], "name": "JCB Digger", "overview": "JCB Digger was programmed by Jonathon Griffiths and released by Acornsoft. This was a new type of game for AcornSoft - a sideways scroller. The object of the game was to capture the 'meanies' in holes and then fill them in to put the 'meanies' to sleep. In reality, the game was jerky, flickery and a fiddle to play. But it did introduce a continuous scrolling level which was put to good effect by future games such as the Repton trilogy, Ravenskull and others.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Acornsoft", "publishers": "Acornsoft", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.38", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__lVfz7Tqas", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/41595-jcb-digger\n"}
