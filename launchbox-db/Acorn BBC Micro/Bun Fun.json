{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bun Fun", "overview": "The idea is that you are a worker in a bun factory. Cakes pass in front of you on a conveyor belt and it's your job to put on the icing. Your mate further along the belt puts on the walnuts and you get paid piece-work. The more perfect cakes you make the more you earn. The more you waste the less you take home. Sadly, your mate has just cleared off to do some fishing and you're left to do both the icing and the walnuts. You mustn't make too much mess or the machine will jam.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "A. J.
