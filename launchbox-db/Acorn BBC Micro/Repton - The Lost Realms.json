{"altername_name": [], "name": "Repton: The Lost Realms", "overview": "Repton: The Lost Realms was originally intended to be a sequel to Repton 3. It was given the working title Cyroid-X but was shelved by Superior until Retro Software re-worked it and published it. The game consists of 24 levels, the objective of each being to defuse a number of time bombs. Before this can be done however the player has to collect all diamonds and golden crowns and kill all monsters. Failing to do this within a certain time will result in the bombs exploding and the player losing a life. There are a number of puzzles that have to be solved and everything has to be done in a certain order or else the player may block himself in. Therefore it's necessary to plan ahead and pick the right route. As usual the player has to watch out for falling boulders as well as monsters, spirits, skulls and fungus. In addition to boulders this game also features balloons that are equally lethal but float upwards. There are also certain doors that the player can remove only by collecting absorbalene pills. An editor is included to allow the player to modify characters and levels.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "November 6, 2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Paras Sidapara", "publishers": "Retro Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/85000-repton-the-lost-realms\n"}
