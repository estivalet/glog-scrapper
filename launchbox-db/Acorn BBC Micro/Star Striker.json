When you reach the docking section of the game, you must attempt to dock the separate stages of the rocket together. The docking has to be performed fairly precisely to be successful. You will be awarded a new ship if you score 50,000 points.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "J F Daniels", "publishers": "Superior Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/103355-star-striker\n"}
