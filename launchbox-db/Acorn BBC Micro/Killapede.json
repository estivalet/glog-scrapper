{"altername_name": [], "name": "Killapede", "overview": "A Centipede style game in which you have to destroy the Killapede with your laser beam. Hitting a body section splits the Killapede in two, thus there will be two heads. Hitting a head scores 100 points. The Killapede will make it's way down the screen by moving left and right, dropping down a line each time it meets a mushroom or the edge of the screen. Fleas will drop down the screen leaving trails of mushrooms. Mushrooms may be shot away by hitting them four times with your laser. Other nasties such as Snails, Snakes, Spiders and Ants will run across the screen; you can shoot them to gain points but be careful to avoid contact with them. A bonus life is awarded for every 10,000 points scored.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Philip Blenkinsopp", "publishers": "Players", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/369896-killapede\n"}
