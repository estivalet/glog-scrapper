{"altername_name": ["The Sentinel"], "name": "The Sentinel", "overview": "The Sentinel is a strategy video game created by Geoff Crammond. The game itself can be best described as an \"energy management\" game. It has a first person point of view and features ten thousand playfields. It's uniqueness caused it to be labelled \"the first virtual reality game\". The idea of the game is to manipulate an artificial landscape so that you are higher than the Sentinel and can then vaporise him. You do this by raising land, absorbing energy, teleporting, etc. What makes this seemingly easy task difficult is that you have to avoid the gaze of the Sentinel's drones. They occupy different points on the landscape. If you are caught in their gaze, you need to move fast or be destroyed.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Geoff Crammond", "publishers": "Firebird Software", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sentinel_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/61226-the-sentinel\n"}
