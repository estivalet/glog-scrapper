{"altername_name": [], "name": "Tarzan", "overview": "You must guide Tarzan through the jungle to rescue Jane. Apart from the more usual jungle hazards such as snakes, gorillas, baboons and crocodiles, there are flying saucers, gnashing teeth and a very large eyeball. On each screen, Tarzan must find his way to the signpost with the arrow on it before he progresses to the next. There are rivers to cross, trees to climb and ravines to jump. Lifts rather than vines provide the means of moving from one point to another, but these are hazards themselves needing sharp reactions to avoid being crushed. Tarzan by Alligata is not to be confused with the Martech game of the same name.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Chris Butler", "publishers": "Alligata Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.17", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/91137-tarzan\n"}
