{"altername_name": ["Valley of the Kings"], "name": "The Valley of the Kings", "overview": "It is said that far away across the desert lie the lost pyramids of Kaculud, rumoured to contain fabulous treasure and a legendary golden mask. The pyramids may now have been discovered, although strange happenings have caused the archaeologists to abandon their camp. Your task is to travel to the site and try to find the mask. The Valley Of The Kings is a real-time adventure. That means the game will continue to play when it is waiting for you to enter a command and the characters you encounter may not wait too long for you to think. The screen is split into two sections, the top part shows what is happening around you whilst the bottom lines are reserved for your commands. The game normally updates about every 30 seconds, although if you wish to halt the game for any reason, pressing ESCAPE will cause 'time' to stop until the SPACE BAR is pressed.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "James Fanton", "publishers": "MP Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/371796-the-valley-of-the-kings\n"}
