{"altername_name": [], "name": "Jack and the Beanstalk", "overview": "Jack must climb the beanstalk, avoiding the smoke, to take the giant's bags of gold and bring them to his house. The giant will chase him, but will not go down to the basement unless Jack has his gold. Jack will die if the giant reaches his home ground, so he must force him back by jumping for the axe and chopping down the beanstalk. Jack can also use a pickaxe to dig holes to kill the snails or slow the giant down. The beanstalk grows in the rain. When the sun comes out, so too do the caterpillars. Catch these, as well as harps and golden eggs to score points.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Andrew Harley", "publishers": "Superior Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40493-jack-and-the-beanstalk\n"}
