{"altername_name": [], "name": "3D Tanx", "overview": "3D Tanx is a simple shooting gallery game, released by DK'Tronics in 1982. You control a gun that moves along the bottom of the screen, firing shells at the tanks looping across a bridge at the top. The shells are relatively slow-moving so some aiming ahead is required. The tanks also return fire with similarly paced shots. Depending on where you hit the tanks, they may be destroyed or only damaged, and still able to return fire from a stationary position. Each wave has a set number of tanks to be blown up, with the number and speed increasing as the game progresses. You have 3 lives, and lose one when hit by an enemy shell or if you run out of ammo.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "dk'tronics", "publishers": "dk'tronics", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_Tanx", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_Y0ReibpVo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/119390-3d-tanx\n"}
