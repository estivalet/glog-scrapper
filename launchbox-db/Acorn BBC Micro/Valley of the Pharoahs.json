{"altername_name": ["Valley of the Pharaohs"], "name": "Valley of the Pharoahs", "overview": "This adventure takes place in Egypt. Many of the ancient Pharaohs were buried in the Valley of the Kings. One such tomb remains to be found. Your aim is to find and enter the tomb, obtain all the treasures and place them where told. Beware the Pharaoh's curse. Note: There is a minor discrepancy with the word Pharaohs. In-game the word is spelled correctly, whereas on the box art and cassette it's spelled incorrectly as Pharoahs. The game's submitted title uses the box art's spelling, with the alternative name using the correct spelling.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Jon Hirst", "publishers": "First Byte Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/371699-valley-of-the-pharoahs\n"}
