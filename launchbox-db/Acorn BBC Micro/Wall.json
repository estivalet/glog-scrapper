{"altername_name": [], "name": "Wall", "overview": "The object of Wall is to knock out all of the coloured bricks. This is achieved by using the bat at the bottom of the screen (and optionally, the one at the top) to deflect the ball onto the wall. The number of balls in a game depends on the number of points scored. Each ball cost five points so, as long as you have more than five points left, you will get another chance.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Geoff Smith", "publishers": "Micro Power", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTwcDRCjVZI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/103363-wall\n"}
