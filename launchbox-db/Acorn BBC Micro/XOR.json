{"altername_name": [], "name": "XOR", "overview": "The player controls two shields, Magus and Questor, which can be moved horizontally and vertically though the maze, in order to collect masks. The object of each level is to collect all the masks, then reach the exit. In all levels, use of both shields are required for completion, and in some, one shield must be sacrificed (walled in or destroyed) in order to complete the level. The physical rules of this top-down maze are somewhat bizarre, but consistent: dotted force-fields can be traversed (and neutralized) by horizontal passage, waved ones by vertical passage; fish will fall as surely and as lethally as the boulders in Boulderdash, while chickens will travel in the direction they are pointed until something gets in their way. Various explosive devices, dolls and even teleporters further contribute to the complication of moving around this maze. Should all its levels be successfully completed, information will be provided permitting the completion of the overarching meta-puzzle.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Astral Software", "publishers": "Logotron", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05aHuckZAh4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/51980-xor\n"}
