{"altername_name": [], "name": "Looney Lift", "overview": "You operate the \"Looney Lift\" and you must not let any guests get to the ground floor stairs otherwise you will get a complaint. Unfortunately, the lift only carries one guest at a time. You have to let them out at the ground floor. The guests don't like you so they won't wait at the lift. You have to wait for them. They run at different speeds to avoid you. Holes keep appearing in the floors of this crummy hotel. The guests fall through the holes if you do not make them jump at the right moment. You also have to look after the luggage conveyor. If the lift isn't at the end of the belt the luggage crashes off, you get a complaint. Fifteen guests and the manager appear each day. If you catch them all, you can repair the floor and try the next day. Each day gets harder, with more holes and more guests appearing at the same time. There is more luggage as well. When the lift is free, it is white. It goes blue when the doors close. There are 80 rooms at the hotel with magenta doors. They are cyan inside. If the last guest refuses to come out, you could let some luggage drop.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "H&H Software", "publishers": "H&H Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/369912-looney-lift\n"}
