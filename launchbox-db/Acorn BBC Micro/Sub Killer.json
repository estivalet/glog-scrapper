{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sub Killer", "overview": "You are in command of a Naval Frigate. Below you, numerous submarines lurk, intent on destroying you with anti-ship mines. It is your job to protect your warship by eliminating the submarines using your proximity-depth charges. Watch out for the Super Subs. These require a random number of hits to be destroyed. Also note that they are indistinguishable from other submarines. Try to hit the deeper submarines as these are worth more points.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "dk'tronics", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/369831-sub-killer\n"}
