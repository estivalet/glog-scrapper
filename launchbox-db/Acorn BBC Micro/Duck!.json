{"altername_name": [], "name": "Duck!", "overview": "In development and pre-release the game was known as Duck Shoot, but was commercially published as Duck! The aim is to help Farmer Tubby, a notoriously bad shot with his blunderbuss, to pot as many flying ducks and swans as possible without getting brained by falling ducks and eggs. Ducks also walk on to the screen at awkward moments. Each wave gets more difficult and if the eggs land and hatch, Farmer Tubby's problems will get worse.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Melvyn Wright", "publishers": "Firebird Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/157238-duck\n"}
