{"altername_name": [], "name": "Wonder Worm", "overview": "Move around the garden, avoiding everything except the pods and the walls; pods are there to sustain you. You move clockwise and anti-clockwise and try to stop the roots growing for a risky 250 points. Wally the worm is not just any ordinary worm for he has an alter ego: Wonder Worm. As Wonder Worm, he becomes super tough, super strong and he grows at a terrific rate. This, plus all his other amazing abilities, are due to the special pods that he eats. The pods are a very reactive, high energy food. They remain stable for a few seconds during which time it is safe for Wonder Worm to eat them, but if they are left for too long they change, turning into deadly skulls. Other hazards face our Wally for the flowers which grow in the garden, where he lives, also feed off the pods therefore their roots grow very fast indeed. Now even though Wonder Worm is strong, the roots can be stronger still, so if Wally happens to bump into one of them, he sometimes goes right through them; other times it destroys him so watch out. As Wonder Worm, Wally's body becomes so hard and muscular that if he should bump into himself it would be fatal.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Kevin Bramhill", "publishers": "Thor Computer Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/156573-wonder-worm\n"}
