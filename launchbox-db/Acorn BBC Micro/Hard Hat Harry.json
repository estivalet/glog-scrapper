{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hard Hat Harry", "overview": "Edwards & Co is in charge of building the RS Tower. 20 stories high, it will dominate the sky of the Midlands. Only problem is, they built it next to the zoo. Which has had a breakout and all the animals have escaped. Naturally, seeing a big object right next to where they were, they've occupied the RS Tower. Now, the construction workers won't stand for this sort of thing. They're ready to take action - once they've had lunch, that is. Which as ever, involves tea. Unfortunately the animals have stolen all their tea and they'll have to get them back. Even more unfortunately, it looks like they'll have to get it back themselves... Wait! What about the work experience kid? Entering HARD HAT HARRY. 15 years old, and working towards a B in O-level French, Harry is the ideal candidate for this deadly mission. But the stakes couldn't be higher. Succeed, and he'll get a good reference and become a banker or something. Fail, and the workers (including foreman Mr. Moore) will rivet gun him to the tower and sod off down the pub.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "2011", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Sarah Walker", "publishers": "Retro Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weQ656ZJFWs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/157434-hard-hat-harry\n"}
