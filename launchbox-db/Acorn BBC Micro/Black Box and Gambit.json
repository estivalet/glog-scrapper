{"altername_name": [], "name": "Black Box and Gambit", "overview": "Two strategy games for up to four players. In Black Box, four atoms are hidden within an eight by eight grid. The object of the game is to deduce the exact position of the atoms by examining the paths taken by rays fired into the grid. The object of Gambit is for each player to attempt to be the first to get all of their four men back to the central home area. Players position walls to direct their own men home or to block their opponents and can send a man back to the start by running over him.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Acornsoft", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.62", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/100752-black-box-and-gambit\n"}
