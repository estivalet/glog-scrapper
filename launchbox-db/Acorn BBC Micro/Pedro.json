{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pedro", "overview": "Pedro's flower gardens are under attack from hordes of animals and he must set up barriers to block their routes to his flowers. He will have to take several trips to block off any particular path. Smaller animals can also be stopped by stamping on them. When flowers are eaten, Pedro must replenish them by planting seeds - allowing time for them to grow, as the game is lost if all the seeds are gone. As well as the animals, he must watch out for the Tramp, who tries to steal his seeds.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Creative Technology Group", "publishers": "Imagine", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/107069-pedro\n"}
