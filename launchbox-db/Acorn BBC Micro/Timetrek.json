And there's a once-only panic button if you are about to be destroyed.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "David Elliot", "publishers": "Micro Power", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/103362-timetrek\n"}
