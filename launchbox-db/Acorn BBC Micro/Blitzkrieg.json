{"altername_name": [], "name": "Blitzkrieg", "overview": "Blitzkrieg is a tank battle game released by Software Invasion for both the BBC Microcomputer and Acorn Electron. Your gun turret is a fixed view at the bottom - the turret also recoils realistically when fired. On moving right and left, the landscape in the distance, which is at the top of the screen, scrolls to simulate the view from your cockpit. In the mid-view are the other enemy tanks which are you combatants in this game. They appear at various distances and move in real time, in a manner relative to the landscape, whether you are scrolling it or not. If they stop and turn towards you, you need move quickly if you want to avoid their deadly shells. Shells that you fire take longer to reach more distant tanks and the sound of them blowing up is also diminished with extra distance. A tank that is more distant scores more, also as your score progresses, you get promoted to increasing military ranks.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Simon Vout", "publishers": "Software Invasion", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwnIG6FzV9Y", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/46194-blitzkrieg\n"}
