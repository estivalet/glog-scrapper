{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dragon Rider", "overview": "The object of the game is to prevent as many of the alien worms as possible from reaching the ground. You have two weapons. A laser lance which has unlimited range, uses your energy sparingly and can kill one worm at a time only. The dragon's breath which has a limited range, uses a lot of your energy but can kill several worms at a time. You can replenish your energy by feeding on the magenta coloured firestones. The dragon's skin colour changes to reflect it's energy level.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Salamander", "publishers": "Salamander", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z0cSe8Hang", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78453-dragon-rider\n"}
