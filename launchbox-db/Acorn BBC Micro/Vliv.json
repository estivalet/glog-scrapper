{"altername_name": [], "name": "Vliv", "overview": "A long time ago the race of Vlivs roamed the land, munching bricks to get the orbs that are hidden in them. You are the last of the Vlivs and have to find the orbs for yourself. Eat the bricks but be careful, you have a limited amount of eats. However, there is no time limit. So you have all the time in the world to think of where they could be. Also sometimes orbs fly openly in the air. You have to eat 6 orbs, then a teleporter shows up that, when entered, will teleport you to the next level.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1998", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "", "developers": "Chris Dewhurst", "publishers": "8-Bit Software", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsLyFfMQpn4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/157120-vliv\n"}
