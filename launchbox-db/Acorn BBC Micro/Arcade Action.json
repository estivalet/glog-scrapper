{"altername_name": [], "name": "Arcade Action", "overview": "Arcade Action is a collection of four games. Space Invaders is a one or two player game and the other three are single player. Breakout: A musical version of an all-time favourite where you knock bricks out of a multi-coloured wall. There are seven variations on the standard game, including progressive walls and captive balls. Dodgems: Your racing car has to outwit the computerised car, which is programmed to crash into you. You have the advantage of acceleration, but must keep switching lanes to avoid a head-on collision. Snake: Guide the hungry snake towards its prey, and watch it grow as it consumes different kinds of food. The idea of the game is to score as many points as possible while preventing the snake from bumping into itself or the walls as it gets longer and longer. Space Invaders: Fight off the waves of advancing aliens while dodging behind four shelters to avoid being hit by their missiles. The closer they get, the faster they move, and the thicker the hail of missile fire.
