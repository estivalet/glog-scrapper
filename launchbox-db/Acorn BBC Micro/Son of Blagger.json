{"altername_name": [], "name": "Son of Blagger", "overview": "Son of Blagger is a sequel to the original Blagger. The player controls Slippery Sid, who is an espionage agent and son of Blagger. Like the first game, the task is to collect a series of keys scattered around the level. Sid must navigate a series of platforms while jumping over robots that guard the keys. Once Sid collects all the keys, he can make his way to the next level by going through a doorway. Like his father, Sid has a limited time to perform this task, and he loses one of his lives if he fails to collect all of them, or if he falls long distances.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Alligata Software", "publishers": "Alligata Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Son_of_Blagger", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X4A1CwQ-X0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/51982-son-of-blagger\n"}
