{"altername_name": [], "name": "Draughts and Reversi", "overview": "In Draughts the player plays against the computer. Pieces are promoted to Kings on reaching the opponent's end of the board, and the computer will make sure you follow the rules, insisting that you make all possible jumps or suffer the consequences - the computer has the option of 'huffing' the offending piece. In Reversi each player tries to capture their opponent's pieces, the objective being to gain as many pieces as possible by the end of the game. (Reversi is also known as Othello.) In both games you play against the computer. Both programs take advantage of all available memory, and so on the Model A the board is displayed in Teletext Mode, and on the Model B it is displayed in screen Mode 1.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Nick Reeves", "publishers": "Acornsoft", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/100756-draughts-and-reversi\n"}
