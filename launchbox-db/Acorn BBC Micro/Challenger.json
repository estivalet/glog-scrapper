{"altername_name": [], "name": "Challenger", "overview": "Challenger is a side scrolling shoot 'em up with similarities to both Scramble and Defender. Like in the former the player flies a spacecraft over a terrain full of enemy installations but like in the latter the player can change direction and fly both left and right. The aim of each level is to clear the ground and this can be done by firing laser bolts straight forward or by dropping bombs. Fuel is limited and has to be refilled by dropping bombs on fuel dumps. If clearing the ground takes too long, the aliens will mutate and come after the player. Other things to look out for are rockets, pips and quads. The quads appear on level 2 and on level 3 they start throwing out pips. A limited supply of shields can be used for protection.
