{"altername_name": ["Chopper"], "name": "Cutter", "overview": "This game was originally published under the title \"Chopper\" as a type-in listing in Popular Computing Weekly magazine, volume 2, issue 33, dated 18th August 1983. It was later picked up by Krypton Force Software and professionally released. It was named \"Cutter\" on the boxart and cassette, but in-game it still displayed \"Chopper\". It had some some minor tweaks which the original type-in lacked. The objective is to chop down as many of the dead trees as possible. Hitting one of the healthy green ones loses you a life. The more trees you chop down the faster you can move.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "J R Harnett", "publishers": "Krypton Force", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/156674-cutter\n"}
