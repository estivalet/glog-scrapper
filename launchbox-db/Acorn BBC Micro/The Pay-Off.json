{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Pay-Off", "overview": "You're up to your neck in gambling debts, so when Luigi calls in your marker which stands at forty big ones and you've only got $50 in the whole world then you're in big trouble. Two-bit hoodlums like you are small potatoes to Luigi's heavies, so it is a very brave (or a very dumb) person who would march into Luigi's and try to place a bet. The only problem is: how to pay the debt? Rob a bank or steal a gem? What happens next? What will Luigi do? Can the debt be paid? Only you can decide. You become the hero and move around the dangerous shady streets of downtown New Jersey.
