{"altername_name": ["3D Maze (IJK Software)"], "name": "3-D Maze", "overview": "A simple maze game in which you have to find your way out of a 3D maze, having been told where the exit is and where you are. It's fairly impressive for the age of the game, but not quite as good as the 1984 game Maze by Acornsoft. A different and lesser known game, also titled 3D Maze, was released for the BBC Micro by Bevan Technology.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Barrie Cridland", "publishers": "IJK Software", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.88", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-M86myraYw", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/74702-3-d-maze\n"}
