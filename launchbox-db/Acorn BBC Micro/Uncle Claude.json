{"altername_name": ["Electro Freddy"], "name": "Uncle Claude", "overview": "This game was also released by Softspot as Electro Freddy. You have to load products onto the conveyor - twelve are needed to move up a level. Avoid Uncle Claude who will throw objects at you or boot you out the door to the waiting ambulance. He's hired the evil corporation to protect his stock and so you must dodge the prickly acorns before they poison you. You can fight back and knock Claude down with one of his products, hitting him from above or below, and finally once all twelve are loaded he'll give up the key to the next level. There are 11 Levels with each one featuring a different product (strip plug, cassette, watch, radio, camera, portable stereo, reel to reel tape recorder, synthesizer, TV set, cruise missile, BBC Model B).", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Marcus Altman", "publishers": "Alligata Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7TfGYbaF0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78046-uncle-claude\n"}
