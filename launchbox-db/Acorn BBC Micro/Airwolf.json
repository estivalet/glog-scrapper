{"altername_name": [], "name": "Airwolf", "overview": "Airwolf is a video game based on the TV series of the same name, it was released for a range of home computers including the BBC Microcomputer. As Stringfellow Hawke, a former Vietnam chopper pilot, and the only man in the free world trained to fly the billion-dollar helicopter AIRWOLF you have been assigned a dangerous rescue mission by the FIRM. Your task is to rescue 5 scientists from an underground lair by destroying its layer of protection and then getting to the core. Moving onto a screen at a time you must shoot out anything and everything in your path, including lots of regenerating static targets. Realistic gravity takes effect, so you can't simply hover in a set position. Elite Systems also re-released the game on their budget Encore label.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Elite Systems", "publishers": "Elite Systems", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.92", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kmzg9Gj0aZQ", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/52370-airwolf\n"}
