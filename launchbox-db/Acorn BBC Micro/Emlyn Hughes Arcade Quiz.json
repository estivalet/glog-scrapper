{"altername_name": [], "name": "Emlyn Hughes Arcade Quiz", "overview": "A general knowledge quiz game with arcade type elements of pub quiz machines. The game board continually scrolls, pushing your counter nearer the left hand-side 'lose' bar - you must get to the 'win' bar on the right. Some of the board squares are empty and can be moved across at will; others, like rising pyramids and spinning diverters, hamper your progress. Question squares give you a multiple choice question which must be correctly answered to proceed. Other squares contain bombs to destroy question squares and inverters which mean you must get the questions wrong. Along the way you'll also find coins to collect - at the end of the level these must be won by answering several questions within a time limit. Cash must be won as there's an entry fee for each level. At the end of eight levels there's the 'master game' - a grid of question squares where six gems are hidden.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1991", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Audiogenic Software", "genres": "Quiz", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/156907-emlyn-hughes-arcade-quiz\n"}
