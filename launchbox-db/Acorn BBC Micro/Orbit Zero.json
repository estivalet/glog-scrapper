{"altername_name": [], "name": "Orbit Zero", "overview": "You are the space pilot defending one of Earth's eight stratosphere layers. Fusion bombers descend from space to destroy Earth. Your mission is to destroy the bombers. You are armed with Mega-Bolts and your display shows target range and direction and your energy level and mission time. Two Scorpion fighters defend their bombers with Energy Blasters and Blue Ice homing missiles. Destroy the missiles or they will destroy you. If time runs out, the Fusion bombers will sink below the horizon to battle with your lower stratosphere comrades. If you let more escape than permitted, your comrades cannot cope and Earth is lost. Destroy five consecutive bombers and you will be prompted to a lower stratosphere layer with shorter mission time, less permitted misses and more vicious Scorpion fighters.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Graphic Research", "publishers": "Graphic Research", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/121425-orbit-zero\n"}
