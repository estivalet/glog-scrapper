{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bar Billiards", "overview": "Bar Billiards is a fun pub sport widely played across the South of England and in the Channel Islands. A Bar Billiards table is similar to a small Billiards table and comes with seven white balls and one red ball. Instead of pockets, holes are sunk into the table; 5 in a row across the far end of the table and four set in a diamond pattern in the rear half of the table. The nearest hole to the front, worth 200 points, has a black skittle in front of it which must not be toppled. Next up are two holes near the sides of the table that are each worth 50 points. Then there is a hole worth 100 points in the middle of the table. The holes across the end of the table score 30, 20, 10, 20 and 30 respectively. Finally, there is a spot in front of the 200 hole for the red ball and a baulk line across the width of the table near the front with a small D extending forwards from it.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mike Williams", "publishers": "Blue Ribbon Software", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/127678-bar-billiards\n"}
