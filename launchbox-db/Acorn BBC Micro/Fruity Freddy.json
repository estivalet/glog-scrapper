{"altername_name": [], "name": "Fruity Freddy", "overview": "Freddy's job is to pick all the fruit in Mr. meano's garden. The fruit starts off as seeds and then grows into plants and flowers and finally into large bulbous fruit which is safe to pick. The larger the fruit the more points but if you leave it too late the fruit will go to seed and multiply to form up to four new seeds which themselves start to grow and so on. If you tread on a plant before it is bearing fruit then Mr. Meano will come after you. Bees emerge from the beehive and chase you. Use the spraycan to knock them out. The patrolling Crazy Crimson Caterpillar should also be avoided, as should the deadly droppings of the Sparrow. Sweets and other goodies appear randomly and should be grabbed. When you have cleared the garden of fruit you move on to the next level. There are nine levels and you can choose any at the game startup. Complete all nine levels to find out what lies beyond.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Chris Butler", "publishers": "SoftSpot", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75383-fruity-freddy\n"}
