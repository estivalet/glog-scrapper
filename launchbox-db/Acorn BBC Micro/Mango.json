{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mango", "overview": "Mango is a maze game similar to Pengo. Your task is to clear each screen of 'Nasties' by pushing blocks of ice over them and melting the ice block. A block is melted if movement forward is obstructed, otherwise the block will move. If you can line up the 3 bonus blocks before all the 'Nasties' are killed you are awarded bonus points. At each new level more 'Nasties' have to be killed but the number will not exceed four on any screen. Three levels of Difficulty are available and bonus lives are awarded at 5,000 and 10,000 points.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Blue Ribbon Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/85653-mango\n"}
