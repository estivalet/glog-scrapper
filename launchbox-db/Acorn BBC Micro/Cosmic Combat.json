{"altername_name": [], "name": "Cosmic Combat", "overview": "Cosmic Combat is a two-player space conflict game supporting either a colour or black and white display. The arena required can be selected by cycling through the ones available. The range of bullets can be set, enabling you to choose between close and long-range combat. A border can be included to delimit the area, otherwise a wrap-around effect operates. Combat then commences, and the person with the highest number of hits after 100 seconds is the winner.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Alexander Selby", "publishers": "Program Power", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.83", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/103146-cosmic-combat\n"}
