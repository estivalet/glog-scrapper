{"altername_name": [], "name": "Nevryon", "overview": "Nevryon is a fast sideways-scrolling shoot-'em-up. The object is to fly your Cavern Fighter over and through various types of terrain, shooting alien vessels in formations and larger weapon structures on the ground, roof and in the air. At the same time, extra weapons like increased firepower become available and bonus pods appear on the screen to be picked up. When the end of each level is reached, there is quite a large alien fortress to be destroyed. This is initially quite easy but gets progressively harder when more different alien weapons are present. There are eight levels in the game which fit into four scenarios: The Giant Battle Cruiser The Asteroid Base The Planet Surface/Caves The Alien Beast There are two levels for each, the second being harder than the first.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Graeme Richardson", "publishers": "The Fourth Dimension", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/72643-nevryon\n"}
