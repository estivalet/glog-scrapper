{"altername_name": [], "name": "2048", "overview": "2048 for the BBC Micro was developed by Eben Upton and published by the Raspberry Pi Foundation (yes, that Raspberry Pi Foundation) as a means to have a BBC Micro version of the popular number/mathematical base puzzle game for Retro Pie's BBC Micro Core. It was developed and released in 2014. Since the game is a BBC Micro game, you don't need an actual Raspberry Pi system to play the game, as it can be played on a BBC Micro or on any of the BBC Micro emulators. Game description: 2048 is a puzzle game. The game begins with two tiles each numbered \"2\" on the grid. The player can move the tiles around the grid, but with every move a new tile randomly appears. When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into a new tile with the number multiplied by two. E.g. if two tiles with \"4's\" are merged they will form a single \"8\" tile. The game is based on an earlier puzzle 1024 and is a conceptual elaboration of Threes!.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "2014", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Eben Upton", "publishers": "Raspberry Pi Foundation", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PufrABmBZE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/156253-2048\n"}
