{"altername_name": [], "name": "Joey", "overview": "A platformer in which you play Joey the kangaroo and must collect all the boomerangs on the screen within the time limit. They will flash as you touch them and then disappear. The faster you collect them, the more bonus you will score. Whilst collecting the boomerangs, you must dodge the monsters and avoid the Aborigines' spears, boomerangs and boulders. There are eight screens to negotiate and only five lives to do them with. Screen nine onwards includes the extra hazards of boulders dropped from above. You can start at any level to enable you to practise for the real thing.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Blue Ribbon Software", "publishers": "Blue Ribbon Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86003-joey\n"}
