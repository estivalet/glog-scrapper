{"altername_name": [], "name": "Thunderball", "overview": "The ultimate objective of Thunderball is to triumph over the opponent by depleting all of his energy reserves or alternatively by becoming the first player to obtain a full tank of fuel. The game comes in three sections where you need to breach the defences, use your laser to transfer the ammo back to your ship and finally confront your opponent in the Cyclotron battle! Thunderball has no single player mode, you can only compete against another human opponent.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Mastertronic", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uuOQ38yj3c", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/164518-thunderball\n"}
