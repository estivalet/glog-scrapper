{"altername_name": [], "name": "April Showers", "overview": "In April Showers you play as a cloud (with eyes) who has to help a flower to stay alive by keeping it watered. You have to be careful not to run out of water yourself. To gain water you have to collect raindrops from other clouds. There are also umbrellas, which you can hit for bonus points. However, hitting them will also drain your water. After all clouds and eventually umbrellas are gone you go to the next day (level).", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ray St. Rose", "publishers": "Bevan Technology", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=za8H8y0KAFE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/155975-april-showers\n"}
