{"altername_name": [], "name": "BMX on the Moon", "overview": "BMX on the Moon was programmed by Tim Tyler for the BBC Microcomputer. It was published by Superior Software in 1984. In this game you control a Moon Cycle which you use to patrol the surface of the Moon. You must avoid the rocks on the surface and also the monsters bouncing high in the low gravity. You should try to shoot down the spaceships which fly overhead dropping bombs. A further hazard is the flying bombs which are often just too high to shoot or jump over, and just too low to squeeze underneath.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tim Tyler", "publishers": "Superior Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.58", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sQsRJX91IE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/41014-bmx-on-the-moon\n"}
