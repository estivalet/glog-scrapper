Storyline: In a strange, hostile world electronic components have taken the 6502 CPU hostage. Its 8 status flags are scattered all over each of the 32 levels. You, a brave electron, have to collect the flags and free the 6502 CPU. Avoid enemies like rogue resistors, leaky batteries and bad capacitors. Most of all, watch out for your nemesis: the positron. Can you beat normal mode with infinite lives? How about hard mode with 40 lives?
