{"altername_name": [], "name": "Urban Upstart", "overview": "Urban Upstart is a 2021 homebrew conversion of the 1983 ZX Spectrum / Commodore 64 text adventure of the same name. This version was developed by Darren Higgs and released into the public domain. Game Description: Urban Upstart is a text adventure with graphics set in a dead end town, somewhere in England, sometime in the 1980s. Scarthorpe is a dead and dreary place, the kind of place that no-one ever visits and no-one can ever leave. It is a tough town, as the inlay says 'even the dogs carry flick knives'. The object of the game, therefore, is to find a way out of town. The text parser allows the player to string commands together in the form 'TAKE BALL AND GO SOUTH'. The game can be saved when partially complete. The player's progress is measured by a scoring system, the maximum possible score being twenty two.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "2021", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Darren Higgs", "publishers": "Self-Published", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/156172-urban-upstart\n"}
