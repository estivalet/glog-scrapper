{"altername_name": [], "name": "B.C. Bill", "overview": "B.C. Bill was developed by Creative Technology Group and released by Imagine for a range of home computers including the BBC Microcomputer. As the caveman Bill, you must compete with other contemporary species, such as the dinosaurs, to collect food. Whack the food with your club and drag the food back to your cave before a dinosaur eats it \u2013 or you. But food alone is not enough for survival, you must also hunt cave-wives to secure your offspring. The procedure is the same here: hit the women with your club before they're eaten by a dinosaur, and drag them by their hair back to the cave (remember this was 1984). Your score is calculated according to how many seasons you've survived, how many wives and how much offspring you have.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Creative Technology Group", "publishers": "Imagine Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE30YnyXjCY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/48827-bc-bill\n"}
