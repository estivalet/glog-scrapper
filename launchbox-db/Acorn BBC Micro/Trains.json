{"altername_name": ["The Train Game"], "name": "Trains", "overview": "You are in control of a railway system, with the objective of turning a profit. You must collect your fare-paying passengers from different stations and deliver them to their desired destinations. To do so, you have to control the direction of the trains and the complex network of tracks and points, randomly generated for each level of play. You have to deal with several trains at the same time as well as the devil train over which you have no control. And all the time, your valuable stocks of fuel are diminishing fast. Peter Balch's original 1984 game was revised by David Lawrence and published in 1991 as The Train Game '91.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "David Lawrence", "publishers": "Acorn User", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/370221-trains\n"}
