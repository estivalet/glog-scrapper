{"altername_name": [], "name": "Crazy Tracer", "overview": "Crazy Tracer is a clone of Amidar. The player controls a paint brush and needs to paint levels divided into rectangles of various sizes. They are painted by moving over the bordering edges, colouring them. When a rectangle is traced entirely, it is filled with a colour. Meanwhile enemies that roam the edges need to be avoided. Sometimes fruit appears in the middle of a rectangle for a short moment. When the rectangle is painted while the fruit is still inside, additional points are earned. The character has a number of lives and the game keeps tracks of the score.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Wal Mansell", "publishers": "Acornsoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjiJODyKviE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/100753-crazy-tracer\n"}
