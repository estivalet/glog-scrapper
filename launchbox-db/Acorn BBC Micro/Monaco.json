{"altername_name": [], "name": "Monaco", "overview": "A vertically scrolling racing game in which you steer your car along the track and try to avoid the other grand-prix drivers. The race track features a chicane, slippery oil patches and gets narrower as the race progresses. There are ambulances, with sirens wailing, hurtling past you. You can steer left and right and accelerate. Braking is achieved by not accelerating. The score for the previous 100 races are kept, though only the four nearest you are shown, together with the highest score and your ranking in the top 100.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Steve Evans", "publishers": "Alligata Software", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/102651-monaco\n"}
