You are in control of a floating space ship, a bit like the one from Thrust, but much smaller on the screen. You have to blast your way through everything that moves on the screen. When you have blown up everything, you move on to the next level. You have to balance the ship and stop it from smashing into any aliens/walls as well as firing.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Sam Inglis", "publishers": "Audiogenic Software", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DT2eMOy0S4w", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/41132-blast\n"}
