{"altername_name": [], "name": "Braz", "overview": "Braz is a platform game written by Paul Branton for Livewire in 1984. You play as Braz who has taken a job in a laboratory on the exact night a rogue and sinister bacteria is infecting all the chemicals stored around you. You must recover a set number of keys to quarantine it. The game is something of a cross between Blagger and Woks in its idea of collecting keys and progressing through screens. However, it also has an element of arcade adventure in that you do not need to complete screens in a set order - you can traverse quite a large map, discovering and collecting keys in each room. Although you're only told to collect the keys, the game proper also tells you to look out for diamonds, gold, spades and umbrellas. What use these are you will have to discover for yourself. Braz was initially developed to the box artwork packaging stage and was due for release in 1988 but was shelved. The game itself was later recovered from the original cassette and was eventually published in 2002.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "2002", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Paul Branton", "publishers": "LiveWire Software UK", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/369218-braz\n"}
