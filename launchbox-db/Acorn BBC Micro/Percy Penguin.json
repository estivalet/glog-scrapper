{"altername_name": [], "name": "Percy Penguin", "overview": "Percy Penguin, written by J.D. Llewellyn, is a game similar to Pengo. It features two levels of difficulty (normal and fast), each with 3 lives at the beginning. You command a little penguin on a board who has to win against enemies in the form of green balls. The penguin can push iceblock away to arrange the board or to crush monsters. There are two ways for wining a level: crushing every monster on the current board or collecting the three diamonds. At the end of a level, the time elapsed is used for score calculation. The penguin can be moved in four directions with a joystick or the keypads and the fire button is used to push the blocks.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Superior Software", "publishers": "Superior Software", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40413-percy-penguin\n"}
