{"altername_name": [], "name": "Plankwalk", "overview": "Sid has to walk left and right along planks which are forever scrolling up the screen. Sid can jump off the end of the planks, and he drops down the screen, either onto another plank or to his doom at the bottom of the screen. These planks sometimes have cherries on them which can be walked over to gain extra points. Little white blocks also have extra points in store, but you have to fall through these. A little black monster chases Sid over the planks and, like Sid, the monster can be killed by hitting the top of the screen or the edge.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Neil Cannon", "publishers": "Virgin Games", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayjLqxkJEGY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/156592-plankwalk\n"}
