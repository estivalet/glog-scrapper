{"altername_name": [], "name": "Green Beret", "overview": "This arcade game arms you with a knife and sends you on a kamikaze mission against hordes of enemy fighters. There are four distinct sections of gameplay, taking in a Missile Base, a Harbour, a Bridge, and an enemy Prison Camp. Extra weapons with limited ammunition can be collected along the way, which will make the task a lot easier. The level is divided into 3 horizontal levels, which can be moved between either by jumping or using ladders, and this gives a chance to avoid the more threatening mobs of enemy fighters.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Konami", "publishers": "The Hit Squad", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush%27n_Attack", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78456-green-beret\n"}
