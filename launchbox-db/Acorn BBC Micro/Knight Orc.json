The protagonist, Gringleguts the Orc, swears revenge on all humankind for the treatment of his race. The game flows in real time; each person and creature goes on about their daily lives and follows their schedule. So, if the protagonist revisits an area and finds a person that was previously there gone, it may mean that the person in question is in another location. The player's decisions and timing play a key role to the game's outcome. The BBC Micro version was never officially released even though it was completed, however around late February of 2021 a scener named Dave Moore (known by the name Arcadian) discovered a copy of the game existed, which was found at the Centre of Computer History.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "John Jones-Steele", "publishers": "Unreleased Prototype", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/158103-knight-orc\n"}
