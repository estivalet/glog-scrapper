{"altername_name": [], "name": "Space Fighter", "overview": "This program is a cross between Defender and Scramble. There are five types of alien to destroy: Mutant (50 points), Swarmer (100), Trimort (150), Baiter (150) and Baryon (150). The Trimort is particularly nasty and has to be hit three times before it is destroyed. Mutants and Trimorts move randomly, Swarmers move away whilst Baiters and Baryons will try to ram your ship. Asteroids also appear on the screen and will blow you up if you hit them. An unlimited supply of lasers are at your disposal but you have only three smart bombs needed to destroy the Baryons and Asteroids. A smart bomb will destroy everything on the screen so it is good strategy to use them when lots of Asteroids and Baryons are present. You are governed in your quest by the amount of fuel you have, but you can replenish your fuel tanks by destroying a fuel dump.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Richard Hanson", "publishers": "Superior Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/103349-space-fighter\n"}
