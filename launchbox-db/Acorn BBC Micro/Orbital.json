{"altername_name": [], "name": "Orbital", "overview": "A highly original game, in this you are a little ball and have to spin around the isometrically designed single screen levels, the only problem is that you can't go down a level and then back up, so if you go below the level of one of the balls, you are stuck. It is a nice mixture of arcade action and strategy as you have a time limit, and monsters chase you, but you have to plan out the levels first.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Jonathan Temple", "publishers": "Impact", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/74294-orbital\n"}
