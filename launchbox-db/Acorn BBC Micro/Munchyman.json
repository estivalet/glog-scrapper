{"altername_name": [], "name": "Munchyman", "overview": "Trapped in a maze with the dreaded Munchies, you must gobble up all the dots to strip them of their power. If you clear one sheet, you will automatically advance onto the next but beware, the more points you score, the more aggressive the Munchies become. To help you in your hopeless task are four Power Cells, located in the corners of the maze. If you gobble these, the Munchies will turn from green to yellow and you will have a limited opportunity to chase them.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Micro Power", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/103314-munchyman\n"}
