{"altername_name": ["Gorf"], "name": "Gorph", "overview": "Gorf was ported from the arcades to a number of home computers and consoles. The BBC Micro version was written by Matthew Waltham and was originally titled Gorph but this was changed to Gorf. The original arcade game consists of five levels, but the 3rd level, Galaxians, was omitted from the home ports. Finishing the game increases the player's rank and starts the game over at level 1 with a faster game speed for more challenge.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Matthew Waltham", "publishers": "Doctor Soft", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIP-SaIsYuE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/74437-gorph\n"}
