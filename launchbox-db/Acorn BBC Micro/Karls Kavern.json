{"altername_name": ["Karl's Cavern"], "name": "Karls Kavern", "overview": "This game is titled Karls Kavern on it's box but referred to in-game as Karl's Cavern. Karls Kavern is a platformer in the style of Manic Miner. It consists of thirty single screen levels where the objective in each is to simply collect all the boxes that lie scattered around. To do it, the player has to jump between platforms (including moving ones) and avoid getting touched by any of the dangers that exist in the underground. Any contact will lead to a loss of life and so will a long fall. Levels also have collapsing platforms and conveyor belts. The player has five lives and when they are all used up the game ends. In addition to playing all the levels in sequence there is also a practice mode that allows the player to try out all the levels except the last one.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Neil Kolban", "publishers": "Software Projects", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/85754-karls-kavern\n"}
