{"altername_name": [], "name": "Arkanoid", "overview": "Arkanoid is an arcade game developed by Taito in 1986. It was ported to the BBC Microcomputer and released by Imagine in 1987. This game is derived from the older Breakout style of game in which a bat and ball was used to smash bricks in a wall. In Arkanoid the bat becomes a Vaus spaceship and the ball an energy bolt. Power-ups are caught by positioning the Vaus below them as they fall (meaning that you risk missing the ball if you go for them at the wrong time). The power-ups include lasers (which are mounted to each side of the ship and allow you to shoot out the blocks), a catching device (so as to be able to fire the ball off at a different angle every time you hit it) and one that slows the bolt down.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Taito", "publishers": "Imagine", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.32", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkanoid", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40508-arkanoid\n"}
