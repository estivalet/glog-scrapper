{"altername_name": [], "name": "Boulder Dash", "overview": "Boulder Dash is a video game developed by First Star Software and released for a number of home computers. The BBC Microcomputer version was published by Tynesoft in 1988. You are Rockford, and you have to dig through monster infested caves in search of diamonds. In each level you must collect a certain number of these diamonds, in order to open a portal to the next stage. Enemies can be squashed by falling boulders, which are released when the ground below them is removed or they are pushed onto empty ground, but be careful because these can also squash you. In later levels, difficulty is increased by many puzzle elements and shorter time limits. There are 16 levels to be completed and five different skill levels available, which affect the number of jewels which must be collected and the time limit.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "First Star Software", "publishers": "Tynesoft Computer Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulder_Dash", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hnsnICBJY0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/41192-boulder-dash\n"}
