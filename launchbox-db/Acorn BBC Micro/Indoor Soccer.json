The names of the teams may be altered, as may the controls and the duration of a game. You control either the black or white player who is filled in yellow. This player is automatically chosen for you by the computer. Control of the goalkeeper is acquired by pressing the 'Kick' key whilst the ball is in the goal mouth. The ball will also rebound off the edges of the pitch.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "John Hamblett", "publishers": "Alternative Software", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/168239-indoor-soccer\n"}
