{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dune Rider", "overview": "Dune Rider is a Moon Patrol type game published by Micro Power for the BBC Microcomputer. You are a galactic courier commissioned by the people of Zennon to run the blockade of aliens besieged their planet, carrying documents vital to the planet's defence. Taking a Dune Rider you set off across the desert wastes of the barren world pursued by the desperate aliens. Move backwards and forwards over the landscape to destroy the enemy fighters and jump over radioactive rocks and lava pits which block your way. At a later stage in the game you will have to blast the top off large outcroppings before you can jump over them. Replenish your fast diminishing fuel supply by hitting a tanker and catching the cannister as it falls to the ground.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Micro Power", "publishers": "Micro Power", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/41411-dune-rider\n"}
