{"altername_name": ["Star Swarm"], "name": "Tetrapod", "overview": "Tetrapod is an arena shooter with controls similar to Asteroids, with the player being able to move forward, shoot and rotate left and right. For every stage the player has to defeat a number of creatures ranging from killer bees in early levels to red devils and poison orbs in later ones. What makes this more complicated is that the screen is full of pods that when shot at hatches a lizard that immediately goes after the creature closest to it, no matter if that is the player or one of the enemies. Killer bees can be killed by a direct hit from the player while the other creatures can only be killed by the lizards. The player should avoid hitting them since they will then chase him more intently. Lizards can not be killed but when shot at they will turn back into their original pod form. Shots fired will bounce around the screen until hitting something. This include the player so the player not only has to watch out for enemies and their fire but his own bullets too.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Nick Reeves", "publishers": "Acornsoft", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/74461-tetrapod\n"}
