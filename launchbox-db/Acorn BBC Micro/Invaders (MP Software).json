{"altername_name": ["Invaders"], "name": "Invaders (MP Software)", "overview": "Not to be confused with the Superior Software game of the same name. The object of this game is to destroy the fleet of alien ships which is trying to land. You do this from your laser base at the bottom of the screen. The base may be moved from left to right to aim at the enemy and to dodge any bombs they try to drop on you. If you are hit, your base is destroyed, however there are defences for you to hide under but these will be gradually worn away by the alien barrage. The aliens descend faster as their number decreases and, if you wipe them all out, another fleet will appear.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "MP Software", "publishers": "MP Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/370671-invaders-mp-software\n"}
