{"altername_name": [], "name": "Camelot", "overview": "Camelot is an 8-bit computer game written by Tony Oakden and published in the UK in 1989/90 for the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron. The game was first published by Superior Software and Acornsoft as part of the Play it Again Sam 9 compilation in 1989 and was subsequently re-published as a standalone title in 1990 by Superior Software and Blue Ribbon. The game is very similar to Oakden's previous game Quest which itself has some elements in common with an earlier BBC/Electron title, Citadel. Camelot is also a platform adventure game set in a large flip-screen castle and the player also has a set amount of energy which runs down when in contact with enemy sprites or hazards. The game does have a time limit, but extra time is gained by openening doors and solving puzzles, so the player must work out a logical sequence of puzzle-solving such that the clock does not run down to zero.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Tony Oakden", "publishers": "Superior Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40638-camelot\n"}
