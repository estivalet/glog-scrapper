{"altername_name": ["Moon Raider"], "name": "Moonraider", "overview": "Moon Raider by Micro Power (aka Program Power) is similar to Acornsoft's Rocket Raid. Basically it is a sideways scrolling, laser dodging game. Your mission is to raid an alien base on the Moon. There are 6 stages of defences to overcome. You command an assault ship equipped with rapid-fire laser cannon. Fuel can be replenished by blowing up enemy fuel dumps and also by docking with the fuel transports. Points are scored for destroying the radar scanners, rockets, Ack-Ack batteries and bouncing space mines. You begin with 3 spacecraft, with a bonus ship awarded for every 10000 points amassed.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "David Elliot", "publishers": "Program Power", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMwYKhlA3N4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/77522-moonraider\n"}
