{"altername_name": [], "name": "Nightshade", "overview": "Nightshade was released for the BBC Micro in 1985 by Ultimate Play The Game. It was the first game using the Filmation II graphics engine. The new engine allowed scrolling around a large world and arcade-like play, rather than the room-based puzzles of the earlier Filmation titles The BBC version is quite a bit different from the other formats, firstly the game is totally monochrome, usually blue, secondly the ammunition bar is under the play screen instead of by the side of it, this is because the play area is considerably larger than any other port, it also plays faster, and has the annoying quirk of enemies materialising on top of the hero removed. There is no joystick control and no way to redefine the keys to the players liking.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ashby Computers and Graphics Limited", "publishers": "Ultimate Play the Game", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40434-nightshade\n"}
