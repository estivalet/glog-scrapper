{"altername_name": ["Wolfpack III"], "name": "Wolfpack", "overview": "Note: The initial release of the cassette box artwork had the title \"Wolfpack\" with a later run having redesigned artwork and the title \"Wolfpack III\". With both versions the cassette media itself was badged \"Wolfpack III\" and loaded as such. Your task is to destroy all enemy units that you can locate in the four Galaxies. Your fleet consists of three Andromeda class Heavy Starcruisers, and a single rotating Base-station. The fleet as a whole can be warped into hyperspace and shifted between galaxies. Some enemy units are very well defended. Battle stations in particular have accurate, powerful and rapid Disruptor beams. Those with very high Battle strength are almost invincible. Other units are easy prey. Battle Cruisers especially have less experienced crews, and only a lucky shot is likely to inflict damage to your ship. Your Andromeda ships are equipped with high energy, tight-beam lasers. You must hit the enemy unit dead centre for any chance of detonating its power plant. As it is destroyed the target will release a harvest of energy. Some of this will be captured by your ship. This valuable and scarce energy, when delivered back to the base station, will count as a measure of your ability in executing the deadly task with which you are charged. If you lose a ship to enemy fire, a rescue is possible by injecting energy from another ship. All energy transfers (to ship or Base) are accomplished by stopping one unit exactly over the other.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Doctor Soft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/369742-wolfpack\n"}
