{"altername_name": ["Rhondo"], "name": "Rondo", "overview": "Rondo (also released under the name Rhondo) is a rather obvious clone of the game Carnival. You have to shoot all the animals, the letters and the ammo boxes. The letters will give you a bonus if you shoot them in the order: B O N U S. Beware of the ducks because if they manage to leave the bottom right a lot of your ammo will be gone. You can get more ammo by shooting the ammo boxes or if a plus sign with ammo appears at the top left or top right. After a game a bonus game will come up, where you have to shoot a polar bear multiple times and don't make him leave the level.
