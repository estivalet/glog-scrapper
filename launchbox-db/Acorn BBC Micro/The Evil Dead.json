When one is taken by the evil shroud, they will become a green mutant. Periodically, weapons will spawn and disappear about the house and which can be utilised to fight the mutants. Weapons consist of hatchets, shovels, and swords, and can be used for a limited time. As you fight the various new additions to the evil dead, they will split into various body parts before being completely finished off, so you will have to contend with disembodied arms, and legs, ghost spirits and such. You score points for each mutant, or evil body part dispatched. The ultimate goal of the game is to score enough points to conjure up the book of the dead, which you must collect and throw in the fire to finish the game.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Palace Software", "publishers": "Palace Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/74168-the-evil-dead\n"}
