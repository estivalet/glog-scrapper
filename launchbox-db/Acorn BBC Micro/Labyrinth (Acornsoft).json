{"altername_name": [], "name": "Labyrinth (Acornsoft)", "overview": "Labyrinth is a video game developed by Michael Mathison and published in 1984 by Acornsoft for the BBC Micro. At the time, it was a highly acclaimed Acornsoft release, with its high resolution graphics, addictive gameplay and fluid animation. In 1987 the game was reissued on Superior Software's Acornsoft Hits compilation. Labyrinth is a scrolling 2D shoot 'em up, consisting of a complex labyrinth made up of multiple levels. Each level is made up of a number of rooms, with the player only able to see a single room at any one time. Doorways are provided allowing the player to move between rooms. Each level contains two special rooms, the 'Gate Room', and the 'Key Room'. The Gate Room contains an impenetrable gate, beyond which lies the next level. The Key Room contains a jewel which will open the gate, and is generally the most well-guarded and dangerous room in the level. Rooms are populated with a variety of monsters, which become more and more dangerous as the player progresses through the game. The player is able to shoot or avoid the various monsters, as well as squash them with a \"boulder\" that the player is able to push around with them as they travel. Colliding with a monster will cause the player to lose health, often leading to the player's death. Different types of fruit are scattered throughout the labyrinth, which will increase the player's health when eaten. The player slowly, but consistently, loses health at all times while in the Labyrinth, and will eventually die without eating fruit.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Michael Mathison", "publishers": "Acornsoft", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.1", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40641-labyrinth-acornsoft\n"}
