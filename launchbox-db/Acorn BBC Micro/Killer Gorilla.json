Stephens wrote Killer Gorilla at the age of 17 after buying a magazine that had screenshots of Donkey Kong, and that made him feel like doing something similar. He was paid 400 pounds sterling for the game. Stephens wrote two other games for Micro Power: Escape From Moonbase Alpha and Mr EE, a clone of Universal's Mr. Do!.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Adrian Stephens", "publishers": "Micro Power", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.33", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_Gorilla", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPkt5mmO-zc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40653-killer-gorilla\n"}
