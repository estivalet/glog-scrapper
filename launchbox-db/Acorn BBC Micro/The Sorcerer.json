{"altername_name": [], "name": "The Sorcerer", "overview": "A game in which you play as a wizard and fight demons. To be successful you will need to transform at times into a torch, a cross or a magic ring. You stand at the portals between this world and the astral world, surrounded by a pictogram of power. The red magic boxes may be used to transform into a torch, a cross, a magic ring and back to a wizard. As a torch you can light the candles. When all 4 are lit you can transform back to a wizard and do battle with the demon. Transforming into a cross repels attacks. The magic ring will restore your depleted energy, but it's elusive and is not always visible. When a demon is destroyed you are ready to face the next one.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Mike Goldberg", "publishers": "MRM Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/369290-the-sorcerer\n"}
