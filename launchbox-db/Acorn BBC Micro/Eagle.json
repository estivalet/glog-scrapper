{"altername_name": [], "name": "Eagle", "overview": "Eagle is a Lunar lander type game. The object of the game is to guide your Eagle spacecraft through the caves and tunnels of the four moons of Thrug, conserving energy, collecting pods and avoiding any hazards. Each moon is represented by five different screens, each of which has it's own hazards: orbiting asteroid belts, narrow tunnels, laser beams, magnetic anomaly fields with mines, and active volcanoes. Each screen also contains four iridium pods which can be collected. You must pilot your craft from the top of each screen down to the gap at the bottom. You must land at the bottom gently, or you will lose shield energy.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Guy Nisbett", "publishers": "Salamander", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0M1kiDibog", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75112-eagle\n"}
