{"altername_name": [], "name": "Roboto", "overview": "Roboto was written by Eugene Smith and published by Bug-Byte for the BBC Microcomputer in 1986. Rampaging auto components are destroying the galaxy's last power source. You control Roboto and must de-activate all of the plant's zones. There are 51 zones or rooms. The components are de-activated by destroying the \"power orbs\" and leaving through a different exit to the one you entered by. Unless, that is, there is only one exit. It is best if you map the reactor as you go on as it contains one-way systems. Some power orbs give extra ammunition. Bonus points are scored by destroying meanies. You can let Roboto rest against a wall which can be very helpful if slithering past some of the nasty things you will find in the dark.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Eugene Smith", "publishers": "Bug-Byte Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_vPaPpHP4&t=41s", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40931-roboto\n"}
