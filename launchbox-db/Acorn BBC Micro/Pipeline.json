{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pipeline", "overview": "Pipeline is a computer game for the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron, originally published by Superior Software in 1988. It is an overhead view action role-playing game. The game is a fast four-way scrolling arcade adventure with a look similar to previous Superior hits Repton and Ravenskull, but with a higher frame rate. It is set on a mining platform above Io, the sulfur-rich moon of Jupiter. Pipeline was bundled with graphics and level design programs, allowing players to design their own game scenarios incorporating keys and doors, patrolling guards, explosions, throwable objects, moving walls, transport puzzles in the style of Sokoban, pipes, teleports and other simple kinds of puzzle logic.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Ian Holmes", "publishers": "Superior Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40606-pipeline\n"}
