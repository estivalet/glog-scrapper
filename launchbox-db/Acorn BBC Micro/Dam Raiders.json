{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dam Raiders", "overview": "A gallery shooter in which you command a Royal Navy frigate. Your orders are to defend a dam which is under attack from enemy aircraft and submarines. The planes drop bombs on your ship and the dam, whilst the submarines attack with torpedoes. You may counter attack with guided missiles and depth charges. If your ship is hit with three bombs it will be destroyed. Also, as the water level falls due to dam damage your ship will eventually be stranded on the bottom and destroyed.
