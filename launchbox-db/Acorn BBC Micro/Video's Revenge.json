{"altername_name": [], "name": "Video's Revenge", "overview": "An arcade shoot-'em-up which flips Defender by 90 degrees. You fly your ship through various waves of different types of enemy ships similar to those found in Defender - i.e. there is a baiter-type, pods, swarmers, landers (except that they don't land). There is also an added feature of an energy balloon; blast this twelve times and your firepower is increased. Your armament initially consists of a Defender style laser system. A function carried over from the sequel to Defender - Stargate - has also been included, inviso-flight. This makes you temporarily invisible and immune to enemy attack. The ship can go in four directions, and re-trace its steps to get an enemy that has been missed. You also have a long range radar scope to see what's coming up, and what's been left behind.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Toby Butler", "publishers": "Budgie [Alligata Software]", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQSoGtsuK8Y", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/118596-videos-revenge\n"}
