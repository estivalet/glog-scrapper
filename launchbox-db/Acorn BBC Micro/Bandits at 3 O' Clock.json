{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bandits at 3 O' Clock", "overview": "Bandits At 3 O' Clock is a one or two player game for joysticks only. The one player game allows you to perfect your dogfighting technique by chasing and shooting the computer-controlled plane. The plane is controlled using the joystick. Pulling the joystick back (down) will make the plane climb; pushing forward (up) will make it dive and pushing the joystick to the side will make the plane increase speed. The option menu allows you to select 1 or 2 players, the background (day or night), clouds, flak and air-ships. A plane cannot be shot down when it is in the cloud but it can crash into the other plane. Either plane can be shot down by flak and if the player flies too close to the enemy airship it will be fired at. If the planes fly into the red at the top of the screen they will be prone to stall.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ed Hampartsoumian", "publishers": "Program Power", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.1", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/102901-bandits-at-3-o-clock\n"}
