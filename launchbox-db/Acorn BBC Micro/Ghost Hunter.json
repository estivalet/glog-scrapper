{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ghost Hunter", "overview": "Shoot 10 skeletons to get to the next level. Shoot bats for bonus points. If you shoot a tombstone or the ghost gets to the fence, you lose a life. You can stop the ghost from getting to the fence by firing the Super-Zap (3 per game). Note from the Complete BBC Micro Games Archive: \"Ghost Hunter was developed by Mike Goldberg of MRM Software. Before MRM could release the game officially, a listing for it appeared in issue 5 of Acorn Programs magazine in August 1984. The listing was wrongly attributed to \"Paul Williams\", which may or may not have been the real name of whoever had secretly sent Mike Goldberg's work to Acorn Programs in the hope of finding fame and fortune. In a twist of fate, the magazine accidentally omitted part of the listing, and, before the error could be corrected, MRM sued. In the end the missing code wasn't printed, and MRM didn\u2019t release the game.\"", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "", "developers": "Mike Goldberg", "publishers": "MRM Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.25", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ciXsOg4c08", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/156074-ghost-hunter\n"}
