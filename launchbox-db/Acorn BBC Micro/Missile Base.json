The game works the same with the player being in command of protecting six cities from an assault of missiles. The player has access to three anti missile bases that each contains nine rockets which when fired explodes into fireballs that destroy any missiles within its radius. When playing with keyboard each base is controlled individually while when using joystick the base nearest to the crosshair is used. In addition to the regular missiles there are missiles with multiple war heads and intelligent missiles which avoid the fireballs. There are also enemy satellites and planes that fly across the screen and fire at the cities.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Andy Green", "publishers": "Acornsoft", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl8c5X6WSZU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78833-missile-base\n"}
