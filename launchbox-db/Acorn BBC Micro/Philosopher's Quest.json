{"altername_name": [], "name": "Philosopher's Quest", "overview": "Welcome to the adventure! This pack contains a program on disc plus instructions for Philosopher's Quest, an \"intelligent\" adventure where the player explores a strange land full of weird and unlikely things, some dangerous, some even magical. In this game the concept of the adventure is exploited to the full, and extended to include abstract thought as a means to progress and survival. However, wild speculation will get you nowhere - you have to use your wits! The objective is to find all the treasures and bring them back to where you began, but in the meantime you have to sift clues, weigh up risks, spot magic words and remember which way you came. Included in this pack is a sealed envelope containing hints and answers for anyone who gets completely stuck. This disc features a new Acornsoft dual format design which allows it to be used with either 40 or 80 track disc drives.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Acornsoft", "publishers": "Acornsoft", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYUahWlOrXc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40781-philosophers-quest\n"}
