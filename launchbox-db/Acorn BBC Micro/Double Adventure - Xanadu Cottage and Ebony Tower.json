{"altername_name": [], "name": "Double Adventure: Xanadu Cottage and Ebony Tower", "overview": "This game consists of two separate text adventures. Xanadu Cottage: This adventure has no stated objective. You begin in a deserted cottage from which you start exploring. As with most adventures, there's an underground maze to be mapped. Beware, this labyrinth is unusual in that dropping an object to serve as a room marker will fail; the object falls into an underground river and is swept away. Ebony Tower: The objective is to search for and exterminate a dragon, releasing a ransomed pixie king on the way.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "M Richards", "publishers": "Alligata Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/102792-double-adventure-xanadu-cottage-and-ebony-tower\n"}
