{"altername_name": [], "name": "Klax", "overview": "Entertaining puzzle game, originally in the arcades, whereby dominoe style tiles come towards you on a conveyor belt, and you have to arrange on a grid to make klax's which are groups of 3 tiles of the same colour. It gets hard because you are not allowed to let any drop from the conveyor belt, if you do you lose a life. It's like Tetris but harder.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "A.C.P.", "publishers": "Domark", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klax_(video_game)", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/82406-klax\n"}
