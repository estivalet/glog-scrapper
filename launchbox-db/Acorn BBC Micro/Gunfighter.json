{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gunfighter", "overview": "In Gunfighter you play as a wild west sheriff, whose town is under attack from a group of outlaws who are driving the townsfolk out. You must search out and defeat the outlaws so that the townsfolk can return. The Doc can give you an extra life, at a cost of $500. Red Indians and potholes in the road mean that you have to concentrate on more than merely the outlaws. You are limited to carrying six bullets - enter the Sheriff's office to gain more. A casino sub-game is included, allow you to gamble some of your money.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tony Love", "publishers": "Atlantis Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rKgSk7gcs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/156116-gunfighter\n"}
