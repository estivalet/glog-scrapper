{"altername_name": [], "name": "Android Attack", "overview": "The object of the game is to defend yourself from the attacking androids. You can move around the maze using the up, down, left and right controls and by firing at the androids. Different androids require a different number of hits. Your energy level is displayed on the bottom - the lower the level, the slower you move. You may drop landmines by pressing SHIFT. Pressing this again as an android passes over it will destroy it. This is only possible if your energy is above a certain level. The only way to increase your energy level is to eat the dots and the other objects that appear in the maze. Beware the \"Smiley\" master android - he can walk anywhere.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Paul Hiscock", "publishers": "Computer Concepts", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.88", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBDK9aQkGP0", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73222-android-attack\n"}
