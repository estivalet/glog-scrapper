{"altername_name": ["Spheroids"], "name": "Round Ones", "overview": "You control a bat at the bottom of the screen. With this, you must deflect a ball towards a series of blocks at the top. A collision between a block and a ball will usually destroy a block but some blocks have stronger shielding and will take more hits to destroy. Also roaming around some sectors will be conflictors and lasers whose fire will destroy you. You are equipped with a Force Shield which will protect you from these. It also has a useful side effect of deflecting the ball back up the screen and also catches Driblets. Driblets are released by mystery blocks when hit. Catching one will cause an effect which may be good (such as giving you an Annihilator) or bad.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "J.
