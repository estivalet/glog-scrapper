{"altername_name": ["Loco Motion"], "name": "Locomotion", "overview": "You are given two options in this game, the first is described as an adventure and the other as an arcade game. In adventure mode, you have to control a little train through fifty screens of railway tracks, collecting gold, avoiding bandits, and switch tracks as necessary and refuel whenever possible. By coupling onto carriages which are dotted about the fifty screens, you may claim points (depending on the contents of that carriage). Bonus points are awarded for taking them back to the bank. In arcade mode you are in control of the same train except that this time you cannot control the speed and you cannot stop. You have to switch tracks to avoid derailing.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Amazon Systems", "publishers": "BBC Soft", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/156921-locomotion\n"}
