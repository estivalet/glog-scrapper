{"altername_name": [], "name": "Shark Attack", "overview": "The object of the game is to protect the octopi from certain death from the sharks. You control a shark net and you have to surround as many octopi as you can with the net, to prevent the sharks getting to them. Beware of touching an octupus as it's poisonous. If a shark manages to eat an octopus before you can protect it, the shark becomes a killer shark, which eats everything in its path, including your net. After you have protected the octopi (or after they have all been eaten), you must fill the majority of the screen with the net to enable you to procede to the next screen.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "John Bell", "publishers": "Romik", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/369847-shark-attack\n"}
