{"altername_name": [], "name": "Free Fall", "overview": "In this game, you control the crewman, manoeuvring him around the Space Station as he tries to destroy Alphoids before being destroyed himself - either by the enemy or due to lack of oxygen. The Space Station is displayed as a large octagon. Although the station is rotating, it is held fixed on the screen, which means that the objects within move in curves rather than straight lines. On the left of the screen the rotation rate of the station is displayed and a monitor displays a trace of the crewman's heartbeat, recorded from his suit's biomonitors. On the right of the screen, his remaining air supply is displayed. Acornsoft Free Fall is fully compatible with either keyboard or joysticks and includes a table of high scores.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Ian Bell", "publishers": "Acornsoft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/74171-free-fall\n"}
