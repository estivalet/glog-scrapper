{"altername_name": [], "name": "Lunar Rescue", "overview": "Lunar Rescue (aka Space Rescue - not to be confused with Space Rescue by DACC). Your mission is to rescue your six fellow earthmen stranded below on the lunar surface. On your command, the hatch of the mothership opens and you begin the hazardous journey through a storm of moving asteroids. As you land your craft, a survivor will race to his rescue and once boarded the ship will take off automatically. But the danger has not yet ended. As the asteroids change to hostile alien ships, you need to be even more alert and use your blaster to clear your path. Finally, guide your craft to the mothership and successfully complete the delicate docking manoeuvre and your first survivor is home to safety, but don't forget his friends are still on the planet surface below.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Steve Evans", "publishers": "Alligata Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/76334-lunar-rescue\n"}
