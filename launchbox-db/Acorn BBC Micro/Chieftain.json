{"altername_name": [], "name": "Chieftain", "overview": "Using your skill as a tank captain you must manoeuvre your tank through the terrain, shooting trees and houses as you go. At the same time the enemy tanks (controlled either by the computer or another player) will be in sight. You cannot travel across mountains or the lake, though you can shoot across the lake. You may use the 'time shift' tunnel to move rapidly from the NW to the SE sectors.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Andrew Newton", "publishers": "Virgin Games", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/156589-chieftain\n"}
