{"altername_name": [], "name": "Anarchy Zone", "overview": "Anarchy Zone was written by Rob Dulstone and released for the BBC Microcomputer by Atlantis Software. In Anarchy Zone, there are a variety of different alien spaceships all intent on destroying you. Some can be killed with one shot, some cannot. What makes Anarchy Zone interesting is the 360 degrees rotation that your ship can do around the entire screen. Wave upon wave of aliens descend from all corners, and you really have to keep moving around the screen in order to stay alive. Sound was good, with music and good effects. Anarchy Zone included such modern features as pass-codes for each level, so you could skip ones you had already completed.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Rob Dulstone", "publishers": "Atlantis Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwUAEhpCeSU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/41605-anarchy-zone\n"}
