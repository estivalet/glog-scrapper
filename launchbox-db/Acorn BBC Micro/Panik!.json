(aka Panik) you must clear each screen of monsters by digging holes to trap them, then hitting them over the head until they fall to the next level. Purple monsters need only to fall one level to be killed, but the red and green monsters need to be knocked through two and three levels respectively. Points are scored for each monster killed (depending on its colour) and for oxygen remaining at the end of each screen. The top eight scores are kept.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Spike Moiran", "publishers": "Atlantis Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/79045-panik\n"}
