{"altername_name": [], "name": "Boffin 2", "overview": "Boffin 2 is a platform game developed by Paul Julian O'Malley and published by Addictive Games. Like the original, the aim of Professor Boffin is to pass through a series of caves as quickly as possible by destroying all of the unlucky horseshoes in each cavern and then touching the resident owl, guardian of each cave. Boffin 2 is included in the original Boffin release and is essentially the same game but all 25 screens have been updated to new layouts.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Addictive Games", "publishers": "Addictive Games", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCWLpGbrdH0&ab_channel=FunCade64", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/118284-boffin-2\n"}
