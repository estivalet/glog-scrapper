In this game, you play a duck and the object of the game is to get the highest score without losing all your lives. This can be achieved by getting all the fruit and gems in the level, or killing off enemies. There are 80 levels to complete and once you complete all of them, the levels are repeated.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Jamie Woodhouse", "publishers": "Acornsoft", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXEr02zvxUI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/156506-qwak\n"}
