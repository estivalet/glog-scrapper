{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pentiles", "overview": "Pentiles is a strategy game in which you have to fit combinations of 8 different tiles (pentiles) onto a red playing area, with the objective of completely covering the area. Points are awarded depending on the time you take and how many spaces are left in the playing area. Each pentile can be rotated either four or eight times depending on the shape of the tile, with the exception of the cross shaped tile which is symmetrical. This is the original 1983 commercially released version of the game.
