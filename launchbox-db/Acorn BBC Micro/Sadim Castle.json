{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sadim Castle", "overview": "Long ago Lord Sadim returned from the wars to find that his wife Leonora had been unfaithful and he had her sealed up in her room to die. Many years later you visit the now deserted and haunted castle: your task is to locate Leonora's remains and give her a decent burial, thereby setting her vengeful spirit to rest. Sadim Castle is a real-time adventure. This means the game will continue to play when it is waiting for you to enter a command and the characters you encounter may not wait for you to think. The screen is split into two sections; the top part shows what is happening around you whilst the bottom section is reserved for your commands.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Helen Seymour", "publishers": "MP Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/371875-sadim-castle\n"}
