{"altername_name": [], "name": "Palace of Magic", "overview": "A game along similar lines to Citadel. Using over a hundred individual sreens, this great platform adventure had you once again playing a guy who spends most of his time finding keys, solving puzzles, opening doors, and bribing wizards! This game was tougher than Citadel, with some downright frustrating screens and puzzles. The graphics are similar, but perhaps slightly better than Citadel, with better sprite resolution. The sound, like many of these games, is at best average.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Superior Software", "publishers": "Superior Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40456-palace-of-magic\n"}
