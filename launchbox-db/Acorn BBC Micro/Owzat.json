{"altername_name": [], "name": "Owzat", "overview": "Owzat is a graphical simulation of a test match between England and Australia. The program loads in two parts. Part one is used to set up the teams - you can either use the pre-programmed teams or change them. Part two is the main section, and is RUN for each innings. The bowling can be auto or manual, as can be the batting. If you put both on auto, you can just sit back and watch. In manual batting mode, you can move the fields around to set up different tactical styles of play.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Virgin Games", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/87040-owzat\n"}
