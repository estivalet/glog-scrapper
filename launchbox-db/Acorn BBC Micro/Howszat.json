{"altername_name": ["Howszat Cricket"], "name": "Howszat", "overview": "Howzat! is a cricket management game for two players, licensed by controversial former Somerset captain Brian Rose on its initial release. Both one-day and multiple-day test matches can be played, with the 17 county teams and 7 international test-playing nations of the time, plus the option to create your own. Each has a squad of 15 players from which to select your 11 starters, including a captain and a wicket keeper - each has a rating out of 10 for both batting and bowling, which can all be edited. After each ball is bowled the batting team decides whether to risk attempting to take a run. Boundaries, Extras, and over limits in One Day Matches are all also factored in. Full scorecards are displayed, and can be printed out.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "G.R.
