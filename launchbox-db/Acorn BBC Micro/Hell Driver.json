{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hell Driver", "overview": "The object of the game is to get to all of the check points (flags) on the sheet before your fuel runs out or you are trapped by the police cars and fire engine. You must avoid the piles of rocks in the road and you have the option to create a smoke screen which will slow down the pursuing cars. An extra life is awarded at 10,000 points and you will be given a full tank of fuel at the start of each sheet. The radar display to the right-hand side of the screen shows you where you are in relation to the checkpoints and pursuing vehicles.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Micro Power", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/103240-hell-driver\n"}
