{"altername_name": [], "name": "Bruce Lee", "overview": "Bruce Lee is a video game designed by Ron J. Fortier, with graphics by Kelly Day and music by John A. Fitzpatrick. It was originally developed in 1983 for the Atari 8-bit and published in 1984 for the Atari 8-bit and Commodore 64 by Datasoft Inc and for the BBC Micro, Amstrad CPC & ZX Spectrum by U.S. Gold. The BBC port was done by Micro Power. The aim is to reach a wizard in an underground lair, defeat of whom can offer untold wealth. In each area you must collect the many strategically-placed lanterns before exiting through the newly-revealed passageway. Some rooms also have escalator-type sections to run along, and the standard (although slightly illogical in this context) ladders. There are 20 areas to be completed. On the way, you'll fight two enemies - a ninja and a green sumo warrior named Yamo. You can defeat them by punching, kicking, dropping on their heads or luring them into hazardous terrain, or even by making them accidentally hit each other. Even after they are killed, however, they keep coming back for more after a few seconds. Since they can move pretty intelligently (they even climb ladders), you should watch out for them. The game also allows a second player to take control of Yamo. There are lots of hazards to avoid by either walking round or jumping - walls of electrical charge and exploding bushes for example.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Micro Power", "publishers": "U.S. Gold", "genres": "Beat 'em Up", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Lee_%28video_game%29", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E1Jy6gZuuY", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40512-bruce-lee\n"}
