{"altername_name": [], "name": "Jump Jet", "overview": "Not to be confused with the Doctor Soft shooter of the same name, this is a flight simulator with combat elements, and is a joystick only game. At the start you get a bird's eye vew of the jet on the carrier launch pad. As you reach 50ft this changes to a dual display showing the side and rear views of the carrier with the jet above it. A little higher and you have an out of the cockpit display. You are penalised for each mistake you make. You're allowed nine errors after which it's back to the launch pad. To obtain one of the five ranks you must successfully complete the selected mission. Each rank comes with more adverse weather conditions - which makes controlling the jet difficult - plus extra enemy aircraft to destroy.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Vaughan Dow", "publishers": "Anirog Software", "genres": "Flight Simulator", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/86886-jump-jet\n"}
