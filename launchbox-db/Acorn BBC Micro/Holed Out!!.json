{"altername_name": [], "name": "Holed Out!!", "overview": "Holed Out!! is a golfing simulator programmed by Gordon J Key and published by The Fourth Dimension, aka The 4th Dimension (formerly Impact Software). It features two courses: Cone Links and Pine Isles. You can indulge in either strokeplay or matchplay. The idea with the former is to finish all 18 holes in the least number of strokes, while in matchplay the winner is the player who wins most holes. Up to four players can take part with each selecting one of four skill levels from beginner to professional. The one selected dictates whether the physical hazards or wind strength and direction influence your play. For instance, as a beginner only the water will affect your shot, whereas as a professional you could be playing from a bad lie in deep rough into a strong headwind. For all shots up to the green your view is from behind the golfer you control. On the right side of the screen is an information panel displaying details relevant to the hole. You select a club from a range of three woods, nine irons, a pitching wedge and a putter. A pair of standalone expansion packs were also released: Extra Courses Vol 1 featuring Glen Aigre and Eagle Park, and Vol 2 which comprised Dune Royal and Owlet Wood.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Gordon Key", "publishers": "The Fourth Dimension", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/47162-holed-out\n"}
