{"altername_name": ["Beeb Chase"], "name": "Beebchase", "overview": "Beebchase (also known as Beeb Chase) is a 2023 homebrew port/clone of the Sinclair ZX Spectrum classic Deathchase for the BBC Micro. It was developed by Chirs Bradburne and released into the public domain in 2023. Game description: Deathchase sees you riding a motorcycle through 14 stages, with the aim of shooting out a succession of riders. Each stage starts with 2 bikes to shoot out, although planes and tanks also appear on the horizon, to be shot for bonus points. You start with 3 bikes and an infinite supply of bullets, with one bike lost every time you crash. The levels are tree-lined, and at top speed it can be terrifying as you try to muscle through the gaps so as not to lose distance on the target bike. Every second level is played out at night, which changes the colour scheme. There are 14 levels to complete.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "2023", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Chris Bradburne", "publishers": "Public Domain/Freeware", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnB0d-J5Roo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/372521-beebchase\n"}
