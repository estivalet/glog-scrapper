{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pooperpig", "overview": "Game description: You play as Pooperpig, who comes from the planet Krapton. Your goal in this platform game is to eat all the apples and put them into the silo in the first screen. The human farmers aren't too happy about that and will make bacon out of you if you touch them (you lose a lot of energy very fast if you touch a human farmer or the touches you). Eating apples will replenish a little bit of lost energy. You can poop out eaten apples in case you need some energy or to block a path. You can also move up and down the lifts by yourself.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Homebrew", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Marc Young", "publishers": "Shareware", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bo6m15B8CM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/114340-pooperpig\n"}
