{"altername_name": [], "name": "Jet Set Willy", "overview": "Written by Matthew Smith and developed by Software Projects. It was released for the BBC Microcomputer by Tynesoft. Willy owns a lavish mansion with over 60 rooms linked in a 3D plane, and must tidy it all before his housekeeper will let him sleep. Each room has its own hazards, such as spikes, revolving razors and ropes. The route through the house must be navigated carefully, due to the multiple entrances to some rooms - this is perhaps the first action game where mapping is an advantage. Another innovation, to the chagrin of players everywhere, is manual protection - a sheet of colour-coded numbers.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Software Projects Ltd.", "publishers": "Tynesoft Computer Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_Set_Willy", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVtzjG6Ctgo", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40821-jet-set-willy\n"}
