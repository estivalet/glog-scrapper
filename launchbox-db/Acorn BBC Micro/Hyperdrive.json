{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hyperdrive", "overview": "This is a chase game set in a maze. You are a space explorer captured by aliens who imprison you in the maze and then, with the occasional help of Evil Otto, they proceed to hunt you down. To defend yourself you have laser missiles, but the more aliens you destroy the more come after you. The game is based on speed and good reactions rather than on strategy, with user selectable levels of difficulty.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Howard Richards", "publishers": "IJK Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/85275-hyperdrive\n"}
