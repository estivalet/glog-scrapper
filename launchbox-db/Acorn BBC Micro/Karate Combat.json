{"altername_name": [], "name": "Karate Combat", "overview": "Karate Combat is a fighting game similar to other martial arts games of its time such as Karate Champ and International Karate. The game involves one-on-one fights against a sequence of sixteen computer opponents or against a second human player. Each bout of fighting lasts until one of the fighters has no energy left and points are scored by doing successful manoeuvres. The game can be played with keyboard or joystick and the player can do high and low kicks and punches, blocks, back sweeps and flying kicks. Extra points are given for accurately and correctly timing a move but using the same manoeuvre too often can lead to a penalty and a reduced energy level.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Martin Sykes", "publishers": "Superior Software", "genres": "Fighting", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.2", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z25PXlIdeDs", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/100964-karate-combat\n"}
