{"altername_name": [], "name": "Empire", "overview": "This game has its roots in the old board game Risk, in which you try to take over the world. A map of Earth is displayed, and you need to choose which territories you would like to occupy before the game begins. Once you've made your selection, the remainder of the planet is divided between the evil Beeb Empire and neutral powers. You and the computer then take it in turns to attack other territories and subdue them. Victory increases your firepower. There are eight levels of play. Choosing the highest gives the Beeb Empire a decided advantage and you have to plan your offensives carefully. Choose the lowest level and you can take over the entire planet in a few minutes.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Shards Software", "publishers": "Paxman Promotions", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/119200-empire\n"}
