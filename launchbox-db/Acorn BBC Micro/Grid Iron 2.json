{"altername_name": [], "name": "Grid Iron 2", "overview": "An American football management game. There are two leagues (AFC and NFC) and their teams to choose from. Players are rated out of 10 on skill, energy and form. Player trading is handled in a soccer-style transfer market, rather than with a US 'draft' format - mid-season trades for money are common. Matches have no direct tactical input, and are viewed from remote highlight shots.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Clockwize Software Developments", "publishers": "Alternative Software", "genres": "Construction and Management Simulation", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/91296-grid-iron-2\n"}
