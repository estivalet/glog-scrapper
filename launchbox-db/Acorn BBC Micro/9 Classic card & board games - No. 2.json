{"altername_name": [], "name": "9 Classic card & board games: No. 2", "overview": "This is the second of two complations released by Acorn User (later Micro User) magazine in 1986. Many of the games had been previously released as 'type-in' programs contained in earlier issues of the magazine. The interfaces are generally clear if basic, and the AI for some games at least is reasonably competent (rather less so for others, as you might expect for 1986). The games are : 1. Backgammon 2. Crib 3. Squares 4. Solitaire 5. Tic Tac Toe 6. Sliding Blocks 7. Poker 8. Sevens 9.
