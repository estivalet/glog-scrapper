{"altername_name": [], "name": "Wallaby", "overview": "The objective of the game is to guide the boxing wallaby up to the top of the screen to rescue the baby wallaby from its cage. The wallaby is killed by contact with the monkeys or the apple-cores which they throw. The wallaby may use his punch to kill the monkeys or stop the apples (if they at the correct height), or he may jump over them. When the wallaby punches the bell, fruits of a higher score value appear. There are five screens of increasing difficulty, and an extra wallaby is awarded for each 10,000 points. Bonus points are awarded for time remaining and for collecting the fruits.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Peter Johnson", "publishers": "Superior Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke_5qLAi_4w", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40490-wallaby\n"}
