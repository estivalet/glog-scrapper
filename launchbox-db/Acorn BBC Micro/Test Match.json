{"altername_name": ["World Cup Cricket"], "name": "Test Match", "overview": "This cricket management game can be played in two different ways, featuring one-day matches on side B, and the full length test matches (featuring two innings each, played over five six-hour days) on side A. A program detailing the instructions and game system (including some precise explanations of the mathematics used by the game to calculate the results of each bowl) loads before the main game. By default the game features England and Australia, although you can manually type in different team names. Before each over the bowling team must choose their bowler, while the batting team chooses its two opening players, and which play should come in after each dismissal. Both batsmen and bowlers are number in descending order of ability. The action is viewed from above, and when a shot is played the batting team must decide whether to run or not - after each run the positions are updated and the decision made again.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Derek Baker", "publishers": "CRL (Computer Rentals Limited)", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/168189-test-match\n"}
