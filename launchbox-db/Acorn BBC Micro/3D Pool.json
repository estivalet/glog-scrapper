{"altername_name": [], "name": "3D Pool", "overview": "3D Pool for the BBC Microcomputer was programmed by Nick Pelling (Orlando). It is known as 3D Pool on the box cover and as Maltese Joe Barbara's 3D Pool in the game's title screen. It is one of the earliest 3D cue-sports games, featuring a fully-rotating table and variable viewpoint allowing for much more realistic shot-playing than the traditional top-down game style (although the game can be played this way instead). The pace, spin and angle of each shot can be set up precisely before playing it. Both 8-ball (pot your seven colors plus the black to win) and 9-ball (pot the 9-ball with a shot that also hits the lowest remaining ball, whatever that may be) are included. There are seven skill levels to work through. A trick-shot mode is also included, with 20 pre-set shots. Prior to each match it is possible to bet on the outcome.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Aardvark Software", "publishers": "Firebird Software", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.62", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCMv-4H7tNI", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/61709-3d-pool\n"}
