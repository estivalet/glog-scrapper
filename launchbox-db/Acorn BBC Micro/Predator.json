{"altername_name": [], "name": "Predator", "overview": "Predator is a side-scrolling platformer which was originally developed by Activision. It was ported to a range of home computers including the BBC Microcomputer (by Peter Scott). The game uses the imagery and characters from the movie of the same name. The game is not a faithfully conversion of the movie however - your unit has already been killed off when the game starts and you will battle scorpions, enemy soldiers and dodge obstacles etc, before facing the Predator itself a number of times. The game is a fairly standard run-jump-shoot platformer, except that you start with no weapons at all and must collect them as the game goes on.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Activision", "publishers": "Superior Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/46086-predator\n"}
