{"altername_name": [], "name": "Starfleet Encounter", "overview": "Starfleet Encounter is a strategy game for two to eight players. Each player take the role of supreme leader of a race of space-faring people, and as such is in charge of a number of fleets of ships. He can control up to eight fleets of ships, containing three different types of starship. Players use these to roam the galaxy and collect resources, which they bring back to their mothership. This serves both as a home base for the various fleets, and as a factory ship to build new ships from raw materials. Once a player feels he has enough fighting ships, he may attack other player's fleets. The object of the game is to become conqueror of the galaxy. To do this, you must destroy the motherships belonging to each of the other players, whilst preserving your own. This involves collecting the different resources from the planets of the eight stellar systems in the galaxy, building ships both to bring back more resources and for offensive purposes, and also hindering other players from achieving the same objectives themselves.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Alastair McLeod", "publishers": "Micro Power", "genres": "Strategy", "max_players": "8", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/103359-starfleet-encounter\n"}
