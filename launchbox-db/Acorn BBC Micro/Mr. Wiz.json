{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mr. Wiz", "overview": "A clone of Mr. Do, you must collect cherries from an overhead maze, avoiding the patrolling monsters or crushing them with boulders. The gremlins can be killed by dropping apples on them or by throwing the crystal ball. If the gremlins are trapped or very frustrated they may eat an apple or dig their own passage to get at you. 1,000 points can be gained by eating the magic mushroom, but beware... this is the home of the gremlins and makes them permanently furious! After use, the crystal ball takes time to recharge. When ready for use, the ball will flash. An extra wizard is awarded for every 10,000 points scored.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "John Llewellyn", "publishers": "Superior Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyT2O0Z6NfA", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40585-mr-wiz\n"}
