{"altername_name": ["Garden"], "name": "Growing Pains", "overview": "Growing Pains came bundled in the \"Fistful of Fun\" compilation and was previously unreleased as Garden. Grow your garden by watering the soil, so that flowers can grow and bloom. Beware of the bees and the snails. If a bee stings you, you have to hurry to the shed and get a first-aid kit and if a snail touches you, you die immediately. You only have one life but you also have an insect spray that you can use against the bees. Your watering can will run out of water, so you must keep refilling it.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "A.P.
