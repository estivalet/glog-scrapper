{"altername_name": [], "name": "Snorter", "overview": "An original from Beebugsoft. The game involves you, the snorter, and the snakes (made up of red circular segments) which rush around the screen chasing after you. There are various barriers which both hinder your efforts, and provide a refuge from the snakes. Also on the screen are a number of moveable fences, and the idea of the game is to shunt these into the snakes, who then promptly disappear. You have a time limit in which to kill off the eight snakes which make up a screen. You die if your time runs out or if you hit a snake. The game has ten levels of difficulty, the higher the level of difficulty, the faster and the more intelligent the snakes. In the centre of the screen the number of snakes left for that level and the number of snorters left is displayed, and when you clear a level of all its eight snakes, you progress to the next, more difficult level.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Chris Krestovnikoff", "publishers": "Beebug", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/121885-snorter\n"}
