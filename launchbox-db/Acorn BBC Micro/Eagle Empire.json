{"altername_name": [], "name": "Eagle Empire", "overview": "Eagle Empire is a side view whole screen shooter based on the arcade game Phoenix, where you have to blast your way through various waves of aliens before facing the heavily defended Eagle Empire. The aliens start at the top of the screen and various aliens will swoop down trying to kill you. You must avoid being shot or touch any alien, as this will lose you one of three lives. Once you have destroyed four waves of aliens, you can then move on to a huge ship and try to destroy the alien inside by blasting his shield away. Once you have killed the alien, then you start the game again, but the aliens are faster and more swoop down at you. The game is two players and each player takes it in turn when the other player loses a life.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Steve Evans", "publishers": "Alligata Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.67", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3lktMcY3E", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/52506-eagle-empire\n"}
