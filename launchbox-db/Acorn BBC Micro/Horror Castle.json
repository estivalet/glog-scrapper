{"altername_name": [], "name": "Horror Castle", "overview": "The object of the game is to rescue the princess from the castle tower and take her to a secret clearing outside the castle grounds. As usual in these games, a number of objects are distributed around the locations, and can be used to help you in your quest. Objects are used fairly conventionally, and there are no logical inconsistencies. Quickbeam released this game for the Dragon and Spectrum computers with the title of Terror Castle. As with other Quickbeam cassette titles Orange Software created a disc version for the Dragon. It was ported to the BBC Micro and published by A&F Software with the title Horror Castle.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "J.
