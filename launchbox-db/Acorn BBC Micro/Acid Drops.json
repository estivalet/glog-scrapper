{"altername_name": [], "name": "Acid Drops", "overview": "Acid Drops was programmed by Mike Granby. Acid Drops is a fixed screen shoot 'em up where the player can move left and right along the bottom and shoot at the creatures that fly around the screen. The title's dripping acid comes from a large acid bath located in the centre of the screen and if the player is hit by a drop or the projectiles of the enemies a life will be lost. The player will also die if all acid drops out. There are three different enemies; moths, pods and spinners. Initially there are only moths but if they are hit by acid they will mutate into pods which in turn will become spinners when hit. Spinners require two hits to kill. The objective of a level is to escape through a gate that is located on the right side of the screen. The gate opens with time which will speed up when an enemy is hit. When the gate is fully opened the game moves on to a second stage where the player has to move through a side scrolling tunnel without crashing. If a crash occurs the player still moves on to the next level but without a point bonus. There are nine levels in total.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Firebird Software", "publishers": "Firebird Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.45", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbW1Ww4uog", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/61171-acid-drops\n"}
