{"altername_name": [], "name": "Forbidden Fruit", "overview": "You must manoeuvre a man around a maze collecting fruit and the key to the door to the next level. A number of creatures also live in the maze and they make your job much more difficult. You can shoot the creatures when you move sideways but not if they are above or below you. If you manage to escape each level, bonus points are awarded on the time taken and the fruit collected. There are 12 levels in all and each one is harder than the last.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Dave Ryder", "publishers": "Voyager Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6D-iBQ3KTU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/156073-forbidden-fruit\n"}
