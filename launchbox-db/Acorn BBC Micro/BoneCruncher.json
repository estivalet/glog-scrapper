{"altername_name": [], "name": "BoneCruncher", "overview": "Developed by Martyn Howard and published by Superior Software in 1987 for the BBC Microcomputer. A Repton style game. The levels are filled with dirt (which vanishes when Bono walks over it), monsters and glooks (basically rocks with eyes). Monsters can only travel on ways without dirt and their touch is hazardous - some even eat up the skeletons. There are 25 skeletons to find in each level and specific steps have to be worked out to reach them (e.g. using a glook to cut off a specific monster's path) giving the game a puzzle-solving character. The game was also ported to Acorn Electron, Commodore 64, and Commodore Amiga.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Martyn Howard", "publishers": "Superior Software", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.64", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonecruncher", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTStjU6No7k", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40787-bonecruncher\n"}
