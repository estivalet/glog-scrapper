{"altername_name": [], "name": "Superman: The Man of Steel", "overview": "A selection of subgames based around the comic book hero Superman. You must guide the man of steel through several missions each prefixed by a page from a comic book, with speech bubbles outlining the task ahead. Each mission permits certain superpowers to be used, and in the first flight, infra-red vision, super punch and super breath are all available. The object is to battle through 'parademons' to meet 'the professor'. From there the superhero must rescue Lois Lane and Governor Lee from the terrorist-stricken Atlantis, anchored in Metropolis Harbour. Numerous nasties oppose you, but you can shoot a flashing ball of fire at them and sooner or later they disintegrate. Other missions involve guiding a space shuttle through an asteroid belt, persuading a bunch of mutant robots that your intentions are honourable (by shooting them), protecting a satellite from an asteroid field, and finally destroying the UFS (Unidentified Flying Satellite) by corrupting the geo-disruptor.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Kevin Blake", "publishers": "Tynesoft Computer Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/156490-superman-the-man-of-steel\n"}
