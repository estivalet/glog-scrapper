{"altername_name": [], "name": "Demon Decorator", "overview": "A Crazy Painter/Amidar style game. It had the pre-release title Painter. The object of the game is to paint the grid. You are the paint roller. To help you escape from the octopus you have stuns, three to start off with, but these can be added to if you either run over a stun diamond or complete a grid. An extra life is awarded on completion of each grid. Painting must start from an existing yellow line, and you can only paint along three sides before the brush will dry out, and the complete line will be lost.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Program Power", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.75", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5frquW6UEeg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/103202-demon-decorator\n"}
