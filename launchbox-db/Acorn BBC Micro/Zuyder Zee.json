{"altername_name": [], "name": "Zuyder Zee", "overview": "An action game in which you play the character Franz Frantic who is tasked with protecting the land from flooding by plugging the holes in the dyke using mudballs from the hoppers. Jump the frogs and turtles and avoid the diving birds. Bonus points can be earned by harvesting the tulips. The mud hoppers are refilled at each new level. Scheduled for release in 1984, it was never actually marketed. However, the complete game was recovered from a cassette that was ready to ship.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "", "game_type": "Unreleased", "esrb": "", "developers": "Simon Williams", "publishers": "MRM Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/156301-zuyder-zee\n"}
