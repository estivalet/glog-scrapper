{"altername_name": [], "name": "Summer Olympiad", "overview": "Five events are on offer in this Olympics-style sports game. These can be played individually or as part of a complete tournament, with the chance to choose your nationality first. The events are Hurdles, Triple Jump, Skeet Shooting, Diving and Fencing. Each event's control system involves rotating the joystick and pressing fire at the correct moments. The Fencing is viewed isometrically, and the skeet shooting from a 3D view positioned behind the competitor, which typify the unusual approaches taken to the events, rather than filling the game with 10 or more generic by-the-numbers offerings.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tynesoft Computer Software", "publishers": "Tynesoft Computer Software", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "4", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/107810-summer-olympiad\n"}
