{"altername_name": [], "name": "Dragon Quest", "overview": "Explore the vast dungeon on your quest to find and destroy the evil dragon that has stockpiled the valuables of all the nearby villages - it's a dangerous mission so it is one you must do alone. Explore the dungeons, find your fortune and escape with your life. When your game starts, your character is randomly prescribed a series of skill points against the following attributes; Strength; Intelligence; Wisdom; Constitution; Dexterity; and Charisma. You are then given the option of being a Warrior or a Magician and a starting purse of 140 gold pieces that you can use to buy items from a shopping list to start your quest with - not all of which you will be allowed to use (depending on whether you're a warrior or a magician).", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "Bug-Byte Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/167024-dragon-quest\n"}
