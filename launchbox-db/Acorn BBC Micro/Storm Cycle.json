{"altername_name": [], "name": "Storm Cycle", "overview": "Storm Cycle is an arcade adventure type game written by J P Townley and J M Perry. Your task is to find the five light refracting diodes that will power a super laser and prevent the total destruction of Earth by a rapidly approaching meteorite storm. You will find many objects along the way to help you in your quest, such as energy bottles, smart bombs, etc. The five diodes are strategically placed around the different locations: forest, garden, moon, cellar and castle. Each location can be accessed via a network of transporters, thus enabling all diodes to be collected and taken to the house at the edge of the forest where, if dropped, they will be removed to power the laser.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Atlantis Software", "publishers": "Atlantis Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/66663-storm-cycle\n"}
