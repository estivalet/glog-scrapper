{"altername_name": [], "name": "Battlezone 2000", "overview": "This is a wargame of the 21st Century in which you have control of the forces opposing a single enemy unit known as the Ogre. There are ten levels of play. Your mission is to stop the Ogre from leaving the bottom of the map. The only way to do this is to destroy all its tread units. The Ogre itself is a computer-controlled supertank, which is bristling with weapons. It has missile systems, main and secondary batteries as well as a host of anti-personnel weapons. The Ogre is a tread or track vehicle, and the number of \"squares\" it is able to move in any one turn is governed by the number of tread units divided by 15. Under your command, you have a number of different units: Command Post and Howitzer both of which are fixed, and Ground Effect Vehicle, Heavy Tank, Missile Tank and Infantry which are all mobile. Before play begins, you will be shown what units are available to you and how many of each you have. If you are not satisfied with the mixture of units provided, you may change them. The map, with craters and the Ogre in position will then be displayed and you will be asked which level of difficulty (1-10). Next, all your units will also be displayed, in position, on the map, and you must decide who moves first. Having decided who goes first, the Ogre's current status will appear on the bottom line. ML (number of Missiles left) MB (number of main batteries) SB (number of secondary batteries) AP (number of anti-personnel weapons) TR (number of tread units remaining)", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "M.C.
