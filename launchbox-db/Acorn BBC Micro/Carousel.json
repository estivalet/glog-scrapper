{"altername_name": ["Carnival"], "name": "Carousel", "overview": "Carousel is a clone of the arcade game Carnival, which is a fixed screen shoot 'em up with an amusement park theme. The game was written by David Shepherd and published by Acornsoft in December 1983. The player controls a gun and has to shoot the targets above him. The player has a limited amount of bullets and when out of them, the game ends. The targets are made up of three different animals: ducks, rabbits and owls as well as letters of the word BONUS. Hitting the letters in the correct order gives a bonus score for each. Ducks are special as they might swoop down towards the player and the player has to shoot them before they land or else he will lose bullets. In addition to the targets, there is also a rotating wheel at the top of the screen, and all of its spokes has to be shot to complete a level. Once everything on the screen has been shot, the player moves on to a bonus round featuring a polar bear. It will move across the screen and the player has to shoot it as many times as possible. For every hit, the bear reverses its direction and increases its speed until it escapes, and the player moves on to the next level.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Acornsoft", "publishers": "Acornsoft", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.69", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzVWTTxMVhc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/45717-carousel\n"}
