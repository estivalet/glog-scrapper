{"altername_name": [], "name": "Ultron", "overview": "Ultron (working title Gorfon) was Written by Gary Partis for Audiogenic and was the sequel to his earlier game Positron. Not to be confused with an Alligata game of the same name published by Viper. The year is 2673 AD and the galaxy is under siege by aliens from the planet Gorfia. Your mission is to blast your way through wave upon wave of oncoming aliens, surviving long enough to take on and destroy the nerve centre of the alien attack - the Mothership. To do this, you have been given command of the most advanced space fighter in the Universe - the Ultron. You begin your mission as a Cadet, but may rise through the ranks and become the ultimate Space Master. There are eight ranks to go through. Four screens go together to make up one wave. The screens are... Space Swarmers: swarming mutants who release hordes of homing missiles. Galactic Imps: approaching infantry whose sole aim is to infiltrate your defences. Space Warp: aliens that loom out in 3D distracting you with the aim of disintegrating your craft. Mothership: the aliens' supreme commander, situated in the nerve centre of the Mothership. Occasionally, a reconnaissance ship will fly past, dropping missiles.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Audiogenic", "publishers": "Icon", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75385-ultron\n"}
