{"altername_name": [], "name": "Poker", "overview": "You are in a noisy, smoky saloon bar with six seasoned poker players. One of them, maybe evil-looking, cigar-smoking Black Jake, deals out seven hands of five cards each. From then on you are on your own with $1000 dollars [sic] to lose. First the betting goes around the table until everyone has stopped raising the stake or dropped out of the game. Then you can change up to three of your cards to make a better hand, and the betting continues. When the betting is over the cards are shown and the best hand wins. If everyone else has thrown in their hand the last player wins but won't show you his hand. The next round then starts with another dealer. Moll, the attractive barmaid, serves the drinks and also gives advice if asked! Full instructions and rules of play are provided in the game and the computer will even decide which of your cards to change should you wish to change them. A word of warning: don't assume that the your [sic] fellow players are beginners \u2014 they probably bluff and double-bluff far better then [sic] you ever will! Warning \u2014 this game can seriously damage your wealth!", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Tom Pinone", "publishers": "Duckworth", "genres": "Board Game", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/168198-poker\n"}
