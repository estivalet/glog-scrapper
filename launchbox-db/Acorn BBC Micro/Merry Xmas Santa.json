{"altername_name": ["Santa's Delivery"], "name": "Merry Xmas Santa", "overview": "This game was re-released by Tynesoft in 1987 as Santa's Delivery. You play as Santa Claus delivering presents via the chimneys. Collect a bonus by eating pieces of cake and pudding and drinking a glass of Sherry. After the first screen is complete, you will encounter low flying Snowballs which must be avoided by jumping over them. These snowballs will get faster and more frequent as you proceed through the screens. Snowmen will randomly appear on the rooftops and block your path. Later in the game, the icicles at the top of the screen will begin to melt and fall. Avoid these or be knocked off the roof.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "", "publishers": "Icon", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/88709-merry-xmas-santa\n"}
