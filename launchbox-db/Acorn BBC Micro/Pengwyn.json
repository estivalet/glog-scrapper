{"altername_name": [], "name": "Pengwyn", "overview": "The object of the game is to position the flashing blocks, which are placed randomly, in a straight line anywhere on the screen. To do this Pengwyn can move in any direction. If his path is barred by ice blocks, he can melt these or move them if there is a space available. However, whilst Pengwyn is attempting to manoeuvre the flashing blocks into line, the temperature is rising as the 'nasties' melt the ice, behind which they are hiding before setting off in pursuit. Pengwyn's only defence is to outwit them or crush them with a block of ice.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "David Regan", "publishers": "Postern", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/370723-pengwyn\n"}
