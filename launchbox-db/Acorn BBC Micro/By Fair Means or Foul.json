{"altername_name": [], "name": "By Fair Means or Foul", "overview": "All fights take place to realistic WBA rules, as you aim to rise the rankings and fight for the title. The crowd frequently shout encouragement and insults, which are displayed using speech bubbles. You need to wait until the referee is not looking in order to perform illegal moves such as kicks and groin punches. Fights last 15 rounds, and a knockout ends that round, not the entire fight.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1988", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Michael Simpson", "publishers": "Superior Software", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.75", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/By_Fair_Means_or_Foul", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRy5Azq1j-s", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/96738-by-fair-means-or-foul\n"}
