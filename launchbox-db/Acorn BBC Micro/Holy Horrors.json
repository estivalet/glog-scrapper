{"altername_name": [], "name": "Holy Horrors", "overview": "Many years ago, Glandor the surf wandered into the village of Clingwood starving and weary. The local people took pity and gave him food and shelter until he regained his strength. Despite their generosity they never asked for anything in return. The years passed and Glandor was never seen in Clingwood again until one night he returned. No longer a poor surf but a rich merchant. So grateful was he for that night years ago that he gave the village a precious golden goblet. Centuries passed and the goblet stood in the village church. But one night in 1873 the church was ransacked and the goblet stolen... it's not been seen since. Intrigued by this ancient story, you decide that you will risk all to return the golden goblet to the church and restore happiness to the village.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Clive Webster", "publishers": "Romik Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "1.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/85312-holy-horrors\n"}
