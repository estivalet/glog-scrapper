{"altername_name": [], "name": "Heist", "overview": "Heist is a single screen platform game where the player takes control of a bank manager who's task it is to return all the money bags to the vault at the base floor. The bank consists of a number of floors connected with ladders and the money bags are scattered all around it. There is a problem though, as four burglars has made it into the bank and are now trying to catch the player so that they can get away with the cash. The thieves also plant bombs at random occasions and when they do the player only has ten seconds to reach it and disarm it before it blows up. If it does or if the player is touched by one of the intruders a life will be lost. In the bank there are two hammers that can be used to knock out the burglars and they'll be stunned for a random amount of time. They can however only be used on the floor that they are picked up and can not be carried at the same time as a money bag. A level is completed when all bags have been transferred to the vault and a short sequence is shown before the bank reopens the next day with more skilled burglars.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Marcus Altman", "publishers": "SoftSpot", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.33", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/78530-heist\n"}
