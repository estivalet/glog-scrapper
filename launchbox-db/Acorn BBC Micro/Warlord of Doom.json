{"altername_name": [], "name": "Warlord of Doom", "overview": "Before the warlord came, the valley was a place of peace and harmony, sweetness and light. But then came the evil warlord, who cast a spell over the inhabitants of the valley and overnight the valley became a place of death. The people consulted with the druids and the mystics, who told them that the only way that the valley could be released would be to kill the warlord. However, there was a problem. The soul of the warlord had been released from his body and was stored in a separate place. To kill him, the soul must first be found and destroyed. The people of the valley chose Tumblestone, the greatest warrior the valley had ever produced, to be their saviour. In this adventure you play the part of Tumblestone. You must find and destroy the warlord's soul, then find and destroy him.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Simon Bichara", "publishers": "Visions", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMTrZfr7L5Y", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/66517-warlord-of-doom\n"}
