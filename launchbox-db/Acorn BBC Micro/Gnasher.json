{"altername_name": [], "name": "Gnasher", "overview": "Gnasher (aka Scoffer) is a fully featured version of Pac-Man with the usual dots, power-pills and roaming ghosts. Guide Gnasher around the maze eating the dots and avoiding the ghosts. Eating the power pills enables you to catch the ghosts; the ghosts' eyes then return to the central cage and the ghosts re-materialise. Once all the dots have been eaten, you move on to the next, more difficult, screen. Sound effects, bonus fruits, four ghosts, tunnels and all the usual features.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Margaret Stanger", "publishers": "Superior Software", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/75159-gnasher\n"}
