{"altername_name": [], "name": "Kix", "overview": "Kix was an exclusive release on The Superior Collection Volume 2. It did not get a standalone release. Kix is a clone of the 1981 arcade game Qix. At the start of each level, the playing field is a large, empty rectangle, containing the Kix, a stick-like entity that performs graceful but unpredictable motions within the confines of the rectangle. The objective is to fill at least 75% of the screen while avoiding the Kix. Other deadly enemies also move around the lines drawn on the rectangles so must be avoided.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Alwyn Adolf", "publishers": "Superior Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaolImfxxAg", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/156501-kix\n"}
