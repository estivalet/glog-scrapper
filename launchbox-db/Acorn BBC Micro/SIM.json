{"altername_name": [], "name": "SIM", "overview": "SIM is an action adventure in which you steer a spaceman through the sky and into tunnels, corridors and rooms, avoiding the nasties such as flying saucers, snakes and giant rabbits. Beware the clouds which can detonate on impact. Your aim is to collect the Simarils and dump them in a reactor. There are a few useful objects lying around - like a giant carrot for the giant rabbit - and some bizarre items to avoid such as the radioactive seaweed.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Joshua Portway", "publishers": "Viper Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/156631-sim\n"}
