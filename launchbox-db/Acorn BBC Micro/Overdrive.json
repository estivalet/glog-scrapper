{"altername_name": [], "name": "Overdrive", "overview": "Overdrive is an arcade-style motor racing game which was written by Peter Johnson for the Acorn Electron and BBC Micro and released in 1984 by Superior Software. Overdrive is similar to Pole Position but only with straight tracks, without bends. The five tracks have different scenes such as fields, night, snow, desert and riverside. Starting at the end the player needs to finish among the top of the racing pack to progress. This is visualized through a bar at the top of the screen. For every car that is overtaken, the indicator moves to the right. The player needs to reach the blue part of the bar to move on. At the end bonus points are awarded for every car that was passed.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Peter Johnson", "publishers": "Superior Software", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.38", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overdrive_%28video_game%29", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mE-BnkEs4", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/48441-overdrive\n"}
