{"altername_name": ["Plan B Part 2: Mission Unlikely"], "name": "Plan B 2", "overview": "Plan B 2 (also known as Plan B Part 2: Mission Unlikely) is a sequel to the first Plan B game. It was developed and published by Bug-Byte in 1987. In this one you continue in much the same way, in charge of a single war drone. Your job is to explore a Togrian Computer Complex, fighting off the security robots. Extra rockets can be picked up and oil cans and spanners will replenish your energy, but be careful not to shoot these before picking them up. Some parts of the scenery can be shot to allow passage, to destroy computer parts or gain access to items, although it may not be immediately obvious which sections can be destroyed. Keys that give access can also be obtained.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bug-Byte Software", "publishers": "Bug-Byte Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7CFPvNJpWE", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/52304-plan-b-2\n"}
