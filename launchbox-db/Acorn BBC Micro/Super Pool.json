{"altername_name": [], "name": "Super Pool", "overview": "Super Pool is a single player pool/billiards game for the BBC Micro. It was developed by Robin Leatherbarrow and published by Software Invasion in 1984. There are actually two different versions of the game, one on cassette and the other on disk. There is a slight difference in the disk version, in that the disk version has the ability to save the high score table, while the cassette version does not have any save ability. The gameplay itself is the same in both versions, however.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Robin Leatherbarrow", "publishers": "Software Invasion", "genres": "Sports", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/119827-super-pool\n"}
