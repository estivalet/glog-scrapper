{"altername_name": [], "name": "Magic Mushrooms", "overview": "Magic Mushrooms is a platform game released by Acornsoft for the BBC Microcomputer and Acorn Electron. You have to go around the levels, collecting the mushrooms and avoiding the monsters. To obstruct you there are one-way ladders, conveyor belts, trampolines and more, and you really have to think about the path you are taking. The graphics are low-res, but very crisp and clear, making them look much better. The game also has a screen designer built in, so that you can create your own levels.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Acornsoft", "publishers": "Acornsoft", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/45405-magic-mushrooms\n"}
