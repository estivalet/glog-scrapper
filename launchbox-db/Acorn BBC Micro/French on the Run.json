{"altername_name": [], "name": "French on the Run", "overview": "You are a British war-time pilot shot down over occupied France. You are taken captive and subsequently escape. In your efforts to make your way back to England your only contact is with the local people who unfortunately speak nothing but French. The game consists of four sections which are of increasing difficulty. On each route, you come up against situations (meeting people, buying things, etc) in which you have to reply to questions in French or carry out actions described in French. You have to try and pass as a Frenchman. Listen carefully to all of the characters who speak French, because the Nazis make mistakes.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Francis Clarke", "publishers": "Database Software", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/117568-french-on-the-run\n"}
