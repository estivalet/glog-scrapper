{"altername_name": [], "name": "Paranoid Pete", "overview": "You play the role of Paranoid Pete, a Weetabix look-alike space farmer who has travelled to the planet Owwayondah in an effort to grow new crops and send them back to Earth in order to solve the world's chronic food shortage. The game starts when Pete is beamed onto the planet surface by the USS Harvester. He has to plant the seeds dropped from the Harvester by digging holes in the right places and filling them. However, the planet is infested with Mega-Wibblies and Pete has to fend them off the plant and himself by banging them over the head with his shovel. Once the plant has successfully grown, an arm extends from the Harvester to take it to the processing plant. Pete is beamed back aboard to ensure everything runs smoothly, but those nasty Wibblies have managed to materialise in the ship and try their best to destroy the Ubik-wheat packs. Pete must use his shovel to protect the cargo. Once eight boxes have been processed, the whole procedure is repeated with more wheat plants and more Wibblies.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Dave Mann", "publishers": "Ubik Software", "genres": "Platform", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/156647-paranoid-pete\n"}
