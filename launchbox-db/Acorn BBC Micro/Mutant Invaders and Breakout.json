Your small space craft must shoot the five invading aliens that will descend from the top of the screen in an attempt to destroy your craft. As well as your laser, you have a hyperspace button that will quickly move you to the opposite side of the screen but beware as it has only limited uses before it runs out. * Breakout is a straight forward version of the arcade game of the same name and is for up to two alternating players .", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1982", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "", "publishers": "IJK Software Ltd.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/166887-mutant-invaders-and-breakout\n"}
