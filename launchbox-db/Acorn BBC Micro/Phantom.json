{"altername_name": [], "name": "Phantom", "overview": "Inspired by the game Gauntlet, Phantom is a top view maze game where the screen scrolls left or right when you move. You are a Professor of Astro-Physics, and with an interest in Psychic Phenomena, you have been sent to investigate four buildings to remove any evil that resides there. You have discovered that each building contains ghosts, monsters and transporters (apparitions that are a gateway to Hell), so with your high powered laser, you must clear four floors of each building. Touching any of the evil decrease an energy counter and when this reaches zero then it is game over but you can find food to increase it. Use of your laser decreases a gauge but you can find fuel to keep it topped up and there are different types which speed up and make your laser more powerful. As you explore each floor you will find locked doors so keys are needed to open them and there are other items to help you like bombs, radio-immobiliser to stun ghosts and glucose pills to speed up. Once you have cleared a floor then you can use stairs to take you to the next floor.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "David Croft", "publishers": "Tynesoft Computer Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/85841-phantom\n"}
