Scattered around the screen are Erics and these must be avoided as well as falling trowels. If you fall off the edge of the screen, touch an Eric or trowel, or lay a brick without one underneath then the game ends. The Bier Keller: Collect all the beer glasses on the screen. As you move around the screen, barmaids appear and you must avoid them, tables or the walls, or the game is ended. The Way Home: There are plenty of police cars in the area as well as security guards and these have to be avoided. After seeing your route home, there are more problems as most of the lamp posts have switched off leaving most of the walk home in complete darkness. You must memorise the route and move up the screen but if you touch an object then the game is ended.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Bob Carr", "publishers": "Tynesoft Computer Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.29", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/74725-auf-wiedersehen-pet\n"}
