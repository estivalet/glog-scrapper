{"altername_name": ["The Hunt"], "name": "The Hunt: Search for Shauna", "overview": "As the pilot of an intergalactic space craft, you have searched the galaxy for the kidnapper of your crew member Shauna. Your mission has led you to an enormous space station, devoted to scientific study and experimentation, where you have finally docked in berth 5820. Your space craft is battered and on the verge of collapse. Only the hull integrity system is preventing loss of atmosphere and that, too, will fail shortly. Your search is almost at an end. All that remains now is to escape to the space station, explore it and find Shauna, and return with her to the flight deck of your ship. The Hunt: Search for Shauna is a text adventure with graphics where you read a description of your surroundings and enter commands to complete your mission.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1987", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Ian Muriss", "publishers": "Robico", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2CA25G_OLc", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/85253-the-hunt-search-for-shauna\n"}
