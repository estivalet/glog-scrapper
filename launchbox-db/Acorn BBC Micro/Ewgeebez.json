Easy enough task you think to yourself but you haven't taken into account the alien creatures which regularly teleport in from a neighbouring foreign planet and of course the space stations own defence mechanisms; the patrolling robots armed with deadly laser beams.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Mat Newman", "publishers": "Software Projects", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaVL7kHjsho", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/156113-ewgeebez\n"}
