{"altername_name": [], "name": "Strykers Run", "overview": "You play the part of Commander Stryker. Basically, intelligence has discovered a weakness in the enemies defenses. Because of the sensitive nature of this information, it can't be transmitted through the airwaves and risk interception. Therefore you have agreed to take it on foot to Headquarters personally. You must travel over land (or air if you can find a way) destroying enemy aircraft and personnel as you go. The gameplay is in a basic sideways scrolling Commando style. Anyone or anything in your way has to be killed or destroyed before you can continue (on the ground at least). You can jump over land mines and duck under some of the enemy bullets. You can also fire bullets of your own or throw grenades.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Chris Roberts", "publishers": "Superior Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.5", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stryker's_Run", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkPeDQKRpEk", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40740-strykers-run\n"}
