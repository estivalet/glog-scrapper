{"altername_name": [], "name": "Hunt the Wampus", "overview": "In this cave exploring game there are three levels of caves with twenty caves on each level. Your task is to find and kill the Wampus. There are other dangers such as two colonies of giant bats, two bottomless pits and some giant spiders. The bats can pick you up and drop you in a different cave; they can be heard from the next cave. If you enter a bottomless pit cave you will fall to your death. You can feel a warning draught when in a cave next to a bottomless one. There is no advance warning before the spiders are encountered and it's always fatal. The Wampus can be smelled from two caves away and you can use magic arrows to try to kill it. This was the feature game on the Micro User magazine 2.08 cassette of October 1984. The game was later available to download from the BBC teletext service Ceefax in February 1988.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Alan Denham", "publishers": "Micro User", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/370134-hunt-the-wampus\n"}
