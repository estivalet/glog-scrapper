{"altername_name": [], "name": "Commando", "overview": "Commando is an arcade game developed by Capcom. It was ported to the BBC Microcomputer by Catalyst Coders and published by Elite Systems. It retained it's original title for the UK market, but the German release was called Space Invasion and had all soldiers replaced with white androids. This created an odd contrast to the World War II scenario background graphics. Elite Systems also re-released the game on their budget Encore label.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1985", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Catalyst Coders", "publishers": "Elite Systems Ltd.", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "2", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.67", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commando_(video_game)", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzGwXLzgqKM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/47240-commando\n"}
