{"altername_name": ["Shuttle Simulator"], "name": "Space Shuttle", "overview": "Your plan is as follows. Launch successfully into orbit. Fetch a malfunctioning satellite by first parking next to it and then retrieving the device with your remote control arm. After the satellite is safely stored, close the bay doors, fire retros and begin re-entry. Fly into a final-approach window and perform a mock landing-flare. Then start your final approach to the runway resulting in a safe landing, debrief your mission afterwards to find your successful phases of flight, and your mission score compared to the high score.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1983", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Microdeal", "publishers": "Microdeal", "genres": "Flight Simulator", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/371497-space-shuttle\n"}
