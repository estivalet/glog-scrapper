{"altername_name": [], "name": "Plutonium Plunder", "overview": "The objectives in this arcade style game is to push the cannisters of plutonium behind the safety barrier. Your first task, however, is to get the Gnomes before they get you. You can do this by crushing them with the Hexoid pods or with the cannisters, though you can stun them by shooting them. With them out of the way you may have to wait for the door to open before you can push them in. You will have to avoid the walls, all of which are electrified, but don't take too long or the hexoids will start to multiply and make life more difficult - in any case you will need to crush some of the pods in order to get the cannisters where you want them. Just when you think that you are in control of the situation you will find that the walls containing the nuclids have crumbled away. When this happens the nuclids, which are highly radioactive, and therefore fatal to the touch, are released, the hexoids are destroyed immediately, and the Megapods, also radioactive, appear on the scene. Now is the time for swift cannister pushing, for you are not likely to survive long.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "John Chaytor", "publishers": "Micro Power", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/77701-plutonium-plunder\n"}
