{"altername_name": [], "name": "System 15000", "overview": "Developed by AVS and published by Craig Communications. In System 15000, your friends company Comdata has been ripped off to the tune of $1,500,000 by another company called RealCo. The Police havent been able to work out how to get the money back, and so it's up to you to get the money transfered back to Comdata. With only the AVS System 15000 software, and a telephone number for Kingsdown Polytechnic computer, you're the one and only person who can save the day. What made System 15000 so interesting was the openness of the game, and the fact that you had to deduce information from hacking into various computer systems around the world while avoiding being tracked yourself.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "AVS", "publishers": "Craig Communications", "genres": "Puzzle", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/41575-system-15000\n"}
