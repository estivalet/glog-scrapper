{"altername_name": [], "name": "Thrust", "overview": "The game was programmed by Jeremy Smith (co-author of Exile) and was developed originally on the BBC Micro. Superior Software agreed to publish it as a full price game but they required an Acorn Electron conversion (to release it as a joint BBC/Electron package). While this was being created, it was also ported to other systems beginning with the Commodore 64. All other versions were to be published by Firebird Software at a budget price. The C64 version actually made it to release a couple of months before the BBC/Electron version and became a number one best seller (hence the claim on the BBC/Electron cover).", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Jeremy Smith", "publishers": "Superior Software", "genres": "Shooter", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.79", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/41054-thrust\n"}
