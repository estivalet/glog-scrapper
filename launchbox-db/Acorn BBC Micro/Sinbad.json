{"altername_name": [], "name": "Sinbad", "overview": "Sinbad is an action, platform game that is very loosely based on the stories about Sinbad the Sailor. It consists of two stages each with completely different gameplay. The first one is viewed from the side and the task here is to convert Sinbad's enemies to a peaceful way of life. A magic carpet with a rope ladder attached to it as well as a number of enemies are moving all around the screen. Sinbad converts the enemies by touching them but to be able to reach them he has to jump up and climb the ladder. However after they have been converted making contact with them again will lead to Sinbad falling off the ladder which makes it increasingly harder to reach the remaining enemies. When all enemies have been converted the game moves on to the second stage where Sinbad sits on the magic carpet and flies through space. This stage is played from a behind the back view of Sinbad and the task is to fly past the numerous asteroids that appear without getting hit. It's also necessary to avoid flying to high or into the atmosphere since that will lead to energy being drained. If too much energy is lost the game will end. The time that the player has to stay alive for in the second stage is the same as the time needed to complete the first stage.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1984", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Dennis Ibbotson", "publishers": "Virgin Games", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/77684-sinbad\n"}
