{"altername_name": [], "name": "Vindaloo", "overview": "Vindaloo was written by Jason Sobell and Kevin Blake for the BBC Micro. It was released by Tynesoft in 1986. Raj, owner of an Indian takeaway, needs to get to the loo pronto. Unfortunately for Raj, he lives in the 80's in a computer game, and therefore his throne room is of course deep underground and there are many caverns and perils on the way, Manic Miner style. But unlike Miner Willy, Raj can only move left or right. He cannot jump, nor can he survive standing on anything that moves upwards, so it's all about descent.", "platform": "BBC Microcomputer System", "release_date": "1986", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "", "developers": "Tynesoft Computer Software", "publishers": "Tynesoft Computer Software", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "5", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8y3lSmIs2Y", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/40408-vindaloo\n"}
