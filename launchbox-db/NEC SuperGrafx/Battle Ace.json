{"name": "Battle Ace", "overview": "Battle Ace is an action-oriented flight game in a first-person perspective. The player mans a space ship, including a radar which shows enemies, and the goal is to reach the end of each level where an end boss waits. As usually, the main occupation is to blast a lot of aliens which approach the player. The available weapons are bombs and a machine gun, both unlimited. Getting hit is a bad idea because it results in death. The player has three lives which can be raised by scoring 20.000 points.", "platform": "PC Engine SuperGrafx", "release_date": "November 30, 1989", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Hudson Soft", "publishers": "Hudson Soft", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "2.71", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC_Engine_SuperGrafx", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbVSsdNsI8M", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/41012\n"}
