{"name": "Madou Ou Granzort", "overview": "Madou Ou Granzort (\"Magical King Granzort\") is a SuperGrafx game released in 1990 and one of a handful of games built specifically for the console. It is based on the 1989 anime of the same name produced by Sunrise, which was created by Oji Hiroi (who also created Sakura Wars/Sakura Taisen and Far East of Eden/Tengai Makyou, the latter of which also saw PC Engine games) and written by Shuuji Iuchi (who created Mashin Eiyuu Wataru, which saw a TurboGrafx-16 adaptation known in the US as Keith Courage in Alpha Zones). It features a magical mecha that is capable of changing its load-out on the fly, each of which has its own color. Red is the melee/warrior mode, which wields a sword and has earthquake magic that can eventually destroy all enemies on the screen; Green is the ranged/ranger mode, which wields a bow and arrow that can attack in various directions and can use its magic to float through the air; Blue is the magic/wizard mode, which has a weak wand attack and can use its magic to create an invincible shield that destroys enemies that come close. Using the three modes, players make their way through platforming levels filled with enemy creatures.", "platform": "PC Engine SuperGrafx", "release_date": "April 6, 1990", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Mutech", "publishers": "Hudson Entertainment, Inc.", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.19", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWUSL8_E0Io", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/115654\n"}
