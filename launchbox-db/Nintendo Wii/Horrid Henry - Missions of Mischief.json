{"altername_name": ["Henry der Schreckliche: Auf unheilvoller Mission"], "name": "Horrid Henry: Missions of Mischief", "overview": "Henry is a headstrong boy, constantly raging against the tyranny of adults and infuriating girls. For Henry, life just isn\u2019t fair. If he\u2019s not battling his fearsome class teacher Miss Battle-Axe or Greta the Demon Dinner lady at school, then he\u2019s in trouble with his Mum and Dad. Now Horrid Henry moves from the multi million selling book series and massively successful TV show onto Nintendo DS, Wii and PC in the form of a fun, fast and funny, action-puzzle game where the player takes the lead role of Henry himself. Henry has a range of special skills and equipment that he can use during missions and his task is to dash around locations playing pranks on the other characters all the while avoiding being caught.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "December 4, 2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Asylum Entertainment", "publishers": "Southpeak Interactive", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "None", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horrid_Henry", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL1SZ4uloKM", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/82180-horrid-henry-missions-of-mischief\n"}
