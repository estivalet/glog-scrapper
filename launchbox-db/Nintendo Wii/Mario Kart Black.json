{"altername_name": [], "name": "Mario Kart Black", "overview": "A detailed mod of Mario Kart Wii, which includes 32 new textured-hacked courses, new music, character mods, multiplayer support, and changes to the graphical and textual interface. It includes 8 new texture hacks that are not available elsewhere on the web. Are you ready for a challenge? Give Mario Kart Black a spin, and see what you're made of! This game can be played online, and uses the same save file as the original Mario Kart game. Sometimes, around the borders of the video game worlds we are so enchanted with, buried behind message boards and traded in the more obscure reaches of the internet lie the odd hidden curiosity. As most people know (certainly the readers of this site do), the obsession of video games for most goes beyond simply playing them. We are inspired by video games, enough so to create them and/or pay tribute to them in a variety of ways. Considering the influence games can have on a varied collection of people, it's not surprising that some have found more imaginative or niche outlets for their creativity than others.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "December 1, 2010", "game_type": "ROM Hack", "esrb": "Not Rated", "developers": "Roobix", "publishers": "", "genres": "Racing", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "4.65", "wikipedia": "", "video_link": "", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/135566-mario-kart-black\n"}
