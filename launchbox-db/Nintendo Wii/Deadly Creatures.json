{"altername_name": [], "name": "Deadly Creatures", "overview": "In this unique predator-themed action-thriller, it\u2019s hunt and be hunted as you become two of the desert\u2019s creepiest predators: the Desert Tarantula and the Giant Desert Scorpion. Travel across a vast, detailed world, where every area swarms with enemies and natural hazards. Ambush and feed on your prey. Use the Wii controls to unleash a variety of fierce attacks against vicious enemies: rival spiders, lightning-quick lizards, divebombing wasps and hungry rats. Stalk, battle and explore from a unique and constantly shifting perspective as you crawl along vertical walls, through twisty underground tunnels and even upside-down! And if you survive the dangers up the food chain, you\u2019ll face larger predators, including the most dangerous creature of all: man. Combining the ferocious, fascinating behaviors of real-world creatures with the epic landscapes and cinematic excitement of fantasy/action movies, this is a game experience unlike anything you have ever encountered.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "February 9, 2009", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "T - Teen", "developers": "Rainbow Studios", "publishers": "THQ", "genres": "Action", "max_players": "1", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.74", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadly_Creatures", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CKpvDvfBU", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2375-deadly-creatures\n"}
