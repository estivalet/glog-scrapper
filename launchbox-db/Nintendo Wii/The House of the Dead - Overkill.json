A pulp-style take on the classic SEGA light-gun shoot 'em up franchise. Back when the famous Agent G was still fresh out of the academy, he teamed up with hard-boiled bad-ass Agent Washington to investigate stories of mysterious disappearances in small-town Louisiana. Little did they know what blood-soaked mutant horror would await them in the streets and swamps of Bayou City. Pulp Funk Horror - Zombie cool, one of the most popular shooter classics injected with a whole new retro b-movie look. An utterly in-your-face zombie-dismembering blast. Non-stop light-gun style action on Wii, blow apart zombies for high-score thrills. Co-op action on Wii. Bring a friend and play the game as intended in your own buddy action movie as two of the meanest mofos in video gaming. Relentless, gore-drenched, over-the-top action - Only the coolest, most cold-hearted agent\u2019s going to keep his head against the zombie flood. Use \"Slow-Mofo Time\" to make the perfect head-popping shot and \"Evil Eye\" to spot moments of opportunity that\u2019ll send the whole environment up in flames. Wiimote reactions.
