{"altername_name": [], "name": "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer", "overview": "It's the storm to end all storms! Cold, wind, blowing snow - all conspiring to ruin that most magical of nights, Christmas Eve! Luckily, a young deer once dubbed a \"misfit\" has stepped up to save the day with the help of his shiny red nose - so shiny, in fact, you could even say it glows. All it took was one request: \"Rudolph, with your nose so bright, won't you guide my sleigh tonight?\" Based on the classic stop-motion Christmas special, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer allows one or two players to play a series of four mini-games based on situations in the special: \u2022 Holiday Helper - The player(s) bounce presents, lights, stockings, dolls and toys where they belong: either under or on the Christmas tree, or into Santa's sleigh. \u2022 Toy Maker - The player(s) paint toys. \u2022 Cookie Cooking - The player(s) attempt to bake cookies for Mrs. Claus. \u2022 Saving Christmas - Playing as elves, the player(s) drop toys onto houses. In the first three games, the players can choose to be Rudolph, Clarice, Hermey, Yukon Cornelius, or Santa Claus; however there is no difference between characters. Each mini-game is timed, and once time is up, the mini-game is over.", "platform": "Nintendo Wii", "release_date": "November 9, 2010", "game_type": "Released", "esrb": "E - Everyone", "developers": "High Voltage Software", "publishers": "Red Wagon", "genres": "Adventure", "max_players": "", "cooperative": "No", "rating": "3.38", "wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolph_the_Red-Nosed_Reindeer_(video_game)", "video_link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjsm96C2Iic", "launchbox_gamesdb_link": "https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/20235-rudolph-the-red-nosed-reindeer\n"}
